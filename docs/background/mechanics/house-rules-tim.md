## Character Creation

*Follow the rules listed in the 2024 PHB, with the following modifications.*

**Chose a Background:** If you cannot find an official background that fits your class, talk to me to homebrew something. 

**Choose a Species:** The species available to play in the world of Taelgar are listed [here](<../../species/mechanics/species-of-taelgar.md>).

**Choose Languages:** Unless your species says otherwise, every player character starts with four languages. One of these should probably be Common, a second should usually be the language spoken most frequently in the region of the world your adventure or campaign is set, and a third should represent your native tongue, if different. The other one is free for you to choose, from [these options](<../languages.md>). You are free to replace one language with a tool proficiency, if you desire. 

**Determine Ability Scores:** Use Point Buy as your option to generate ability scores. 

>[!info]+ D&D Beyond
> When you make your character in D&D Beyond, follow these guidelines:
> 1. On the Home screen, select Homebrew and Expanded Rules in Sources. 
> 2. On the species page, if your chosen species is listed as "Homebrew" in the species table, Filter Species Source(s) to Homebrew. The current versions of species should be named simply Elf, Dwarf, etc, but use the Homebrew versions. 
> 3. Do not select Languages in the character builder. Instead, add your chosen languages (and optionally bonus Tool Proficiency) to your character sheet directly once your character is created.

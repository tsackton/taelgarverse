## Narrative
### Day 4 (Wednesday), continued 
*Early afternoon, continued.* After taking a short rest in the barracks, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>), [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>), and [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) proceed across the hoarding to investigate the other tower, spotting [Oona Stonebridge](<../../people/halflings/oona-stonebridge.md>) on the road below nervously tending her horses. While crossing, the party is attacked by stirges hiding in the rafters, but quickly fights them off. The stirges, however, presumably explain the peddler drained of blood on the road. Reaching the far tower, the party descends the stairs (ignoring several closed doors), following a trail of blood. On the next level, they find an empty common room and a locked door, which is quickly dismantled with fire and eldritch force, revealing an armory. After a quick search turns up only mundane weapons and a chest they cannot unlock, the party moves on. 
Continuing down the stairs to the lowest level, the party entered the smithy, encountering the undead remains of Bartoz, the smith. As he turned to attack with his giant maul, Fazoth wrestled for the weapon with his mage hand while Yvan made fire appear and Drou hit him with a starry wisp. As Fazoth struggled for the maul, the smith attacked, off-balance, missing, and giving Fazoth an opening to stab him with both daggers, pinning him to the wall and then killing him. 
After the fight, the party finally finds the winch room, but realizes that it requires operating from both sides as once to raise the gates. Now that it is clear how the winches operate, though, it is easy enough for Fazoth and Drou to cross over and coordinate raising the winches. 
*Late afternoon.* After raising the gates, but before deciding to leave the Watch, the group decides to explore the top of the tower, where the the Watch commander Sir Enrik Aarpad's quarters probably are. Ascending the stairs, the first thing the party finds is the dead body of Marshal [Hildo Brask](<../../people/addermarians/hildo-brask.md>), apparently prevented from turning into a zombie by his holy symbol of [The Mother](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-mother.md>). As the air gets colder and the lights dimmer, the party continues towards the ghost of Sir [Einrik Arpaad](<../../people/addermarians/einrik-arpaad.md>). They pass through his study (where they find a locked chest, with coins and items marked with the Aarpad falcon crest) before finding the ghost in the bedroom, where they see the dead body of Sir Aarpad, a [strange dagger](<../../things/magic-items/serpentine-dagger.md>) with a bejeweled hilt lying next to his hand. 
The ghost initially ignores them, but when the party asks about the dagger, it becomes enraged, turning with a shriek that frightened Yvan, who flees. While the ghost is focused on the fleeing Yvan, Fazoth subtly manages to grasp the dagger with mage hand, and then both he and Drou run as they are pelted with flying debris. 
In the barracks below, the party regroups and examines the dagger. Fazoth recalls that the gems in the handle -- serpentine -- are often used to enhance mind-altering enchantments. Deciding to test the dagger, Fazoth's familiar touches the weapon and immediately turns to attack Fazoth, knocking him unconscious with its sting. Fortunately, Drou and Yvan manage to drive it away, and stabilize Fazoth. 
The party leaves [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>) (although Drou and Yvan go back later to recover the Marshal's body -- for burial -- and the treasure chest), and spends the night camped with Oona, who is a little disappointed the party didn't discover more about the origin of the cursed dagger but admits dealing with ghosts and curses is more than she hired them for. 


### Day 5 (Thursday)
The party travels uneventfully on uneven roads through [Torvaine Forest](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-forest.md>), escorting Oona and her cart. 


### Day 6 (Friday)
In the morning, on the road to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), the party meets Sir Gareth Howell, a knight in the service of the castellan of Roscombe, Lady Elowen Duval. He is traveling with a small company of knights to investigate the silence from [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>). After some slightly stilted conversation, where the party is reluctant to report what happened, with [Oona Stonebridge](<../../people/halflings/oona-stonebridge.md>)'s encouragement [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) speaks convincingly about the [Serpentine Dagger](<../../things/magic-items/serpentine-dagger.md>), the curse, and the tragedy of [Einrik Arpaad](<../../people/addermarians/einrik-arpaad.md>)'s death, convincing Gareth that he is skilled in the arcane and will keep the dagger safe. 
With that, the soldiers continue south, and the party continues to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), arriving in the evening. 


### Day 7 (Saturday)
In [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), the party says farewell to [Oona Stonebridge](<../../people/halflings/oona-stonebridge.md>), and meets with Elowen Duval to discuss the dagger and the events at [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>), as well as receive a bounty for the weapons and treasure recovered from the watch. 
Lady Duval asks that [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) meet with [Owen Tavish](<../../people/addermarians/owen-tavish.md>), a priest of [The Sibyl](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-sibyl.md>) is [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), who may be able to help with the [Serpentine Dagger](<../../things/magic-items/serpentine-dagger.md>). She also says that a rider has come in from the watch, with news, and she reports the full story to the party: 
It seems that a soldier, foraging in the woods just before the recent storms, stumbled across the tomb of a forgotten warrior from the days when the Dominion of Avatus subjugated these hills. In the tomb, he found some coins and a strange dagger which carried a deadly curse. Returning to the watch, he turned the dagger over to the smith, Bartoz, who after discussion with the temple steward, [Wulfram](<../../people/addermarians/wulfram.md>), felt the deadly magic of the dagger must be contained and feared its influence on the watch, especially with the storm. The second-in-command, Marshal [Hildo Brask](<../../people/addermarians/hildo-brask.md>), brought the dagger to the attention of the commander of the watch, Sir [Einrik Arpaad](<../../people/addermarians/einrik-arpaad.md>), who sadly was overcome by the curse. Sir Arpaad killed Brask and then slaughtered the entire watch, before being mortally wounded by the smith Bartoz. The evil of his act bound his soul to the earth, and he rose as a ghost. 
We end the session the evening of Day 7, at the Traveler's Rest in [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>).

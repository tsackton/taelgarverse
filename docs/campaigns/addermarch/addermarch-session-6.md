## Narrative 

### Day 15 (Sunday, cont)
We begin on Sunday, in [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>). The party spends the day uneventfully, stopping at the regular weekly market for a few purchases, before meeting [Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>) in the evening. Caradoc is impressed with their work so far, and proposes a harder challenge: descend into the deep caverns below the earth, and recover Uligium, a living mineral that is highly valued for alchemical purposes. The party agrees.

### Day 16 (Monday)
The party spends the next day in preparation, buying rope and other supplies for cave exploration, and asking  Colette du Bois and others around town for information about the closest deep cave system.

### Day 17 (Tuesday)
The party departs [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) early, heading west towards where rumors indicate the deepest cave system nearby is located. The first part of the journey, along a cart track towards the village of Fontwick, is uneventful as the party passes through fields and pastures. Around mid-afternoon, the party encounters two distraught dairy farmers, Samatha of Fontwick and Godfrey of Fontwick. Their cows have been killed by a terrible burrowing insect creature of massive size, and they are fleeing towards [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) to ask for aid from Lady Elowen Duval. 

The party decides to help, and Samatha of Fontwick leads them back to her farm while Godfrey of Fontwick continues to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) to inform Elowen Duval of the happenings. The party keeps watch on the fields through the evening, until around midnight an ankheg bursts from the ground and attacks. Quickly both [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) and [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) attack it with witch bolts, but it burrows underground, breaking the connect of the spell. Nonetheless, it is subdued without serious trouble.

### Day 18 (Wednesday)
We end the morning of the next day. [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) gives Samatha of Fontwick a substantial sum of coins to buy new cows; she is incredibly thankful, offering bread, cheese, and apples for the road.

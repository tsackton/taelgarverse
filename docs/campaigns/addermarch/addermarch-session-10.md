## Narrative

### Day 20 (Friday)

We begin in the morning, as the party wakes to the smell of fried mushroom pancakes and a smoky tea being prepared for breakfast by Zibzig Sparkscale. The kobold wizard is in a chatty mood, discussing the magic that he will invent, with time, and asking for help for memorable names for the spells he will be discovering. Grateful for the party's help with the [cave fisher the day before](<./addermarch-session-9.md>), Zibzig gives them directions to another source of Uligium he knows of, and the way out of the cave. He does warn them that the uligium is defended by strange predators who lurk over the water. 

The party follows the directions, finding their way to a cavern with a chasm to one side, across which lies a still pool of water and a small tunnel. As the party approaches, suddenly impenetrable blackness falls as the party attacks the darkmantles. Four of them detach from the ceiling to attack; [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) surges with magical power as he fires bolts of fire blindly into the darkness. Meanwhile lightning crackles from [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>), as his pseudodragon uses its blindsight to aid him in the fight. [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) struggles to get a purchase on the enemy in the dark, but eventually the darkmantles are defeated. With magical energy still ricochetting around [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>), he approaches the tunnel, heating a glass bottle with his hand and attracting the Uligium. 

Following Zibzig Sparkscale's directions, the party returns to the cave entrance without trouble. At the entrance, the ogre and his wolf still stand guard, but [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)'s _Calm Emotions_ spell keeps them indifferent to the party for a moment as they flee out of the cave.

With their four vials of uligium, the party heads back torwards [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), traveling for the whole day before camping in the fields.

### Day 21 (Saturday)
The party spends the day traveling, arriving back at [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) at the evening, where we end.

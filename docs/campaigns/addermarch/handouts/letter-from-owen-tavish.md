Dear Fazoth, and company,

I write in haste as I depart this morning before dawn. Sir Gareth Howell has requested divine aid to cleanse the haunting at Torvaine Watch, so I ride south to aid him. I dearly wish to speak with you regarding the cursed dagger you have recovered, but it will have to wait until I return, for duty calls me now. Should you wish, you may leave the dagger in the care of Isolde, the temple steward at the Temple of the Sibyl, who can keep it under lock and key in the temple vaults. I leave this up to your judgement, but no matter what, keep it secret, and keep it safe!

The blessings of the Sibyl on you,  
Owen Tavish

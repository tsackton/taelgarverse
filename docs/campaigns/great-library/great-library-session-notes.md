# The Chronicles of the Silver Tempests

Herein lies the chronicles of the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>), from their humble roots as hired adventurers for the [Great Library](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>), to their current fame.
## Adventure 0: Die Froggies Die

[Samso](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) and [Adrik](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) meet on the road to [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), both seeking adventure. Finding a dead horse, they chase some [bullywugs](<../../species/unusual-species/bullywugs.md>) into a swamp and recover a message bag from a messenger.
### Events

- Feb 16, 1747 DR: [Samso](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) and [Adrik](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) meet on the road south of [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) and retrieve a lost messenger bag from a messenger killed by [bullywugs](<../../species/unusual-species/bullywugs.md>). 

## Adventure 1: The Flamekeeper Scroll
### Session 1

Our adventure starts on the road: [Brelith](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>), [Adrik](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) , [Samso](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>), and [Alton](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/alton.md>) have traveled north towards [Voltara](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/voltara.md>) to meet Archivist [Lyra](<../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>), in the service of the [Great Library](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>). On the road goblins of the Red Knife tribe attack; they slay two and let the other two live, after learning that hobgoblins and goblins live in this area. The goblins are told to flee and not attack them again.

In [Lyra](<../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>)’s camp, the party learns their mission: search for the scrolls of elemental power. The location of the Flamekeeper Scroll and the Stonemaster Scroll are known, while the location of the Skyborn Scroll and the Deepwater Scroll are not. 

Our heroes decide to head to the Forge of Fire, a part of an ancient Dwarven mine complex that once extended through much of the [Fiamatara Mountains](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/fiamatara-mountains.md>), where the Flamekeeper Scroll is thought to be. They find it is now a kobold shrine to the “fire god”, which is a rune protecting the Flamekeeper Scroll. After killing some kobolds and convincing others they are the fire god made flesh, they get the scroll, and leave, but not before triggering a magma eruption which destroys forge and probably all the kobolds.

With the map from Archivist Lyra, they set forth to find the Stonemaster Scroll. Traveling north across the plains, they encounter a few orcs before arriving at the cave where the scroll is hidden. After defeating some puzzled orc guards, a cursed swarm of tiny orcs, and a magically shrunken hill giant, they find the scroll is a large stone chest. Samso recovers a shrunken black bear which he names Friend.

### Session 3

Adrik, Samso, Aglath, and Brelith meet two new recruits for the Great Library team: Aelar the Elven Monk, and Scordith the Human Sorcerer. The party is sent to explore the Pietravola Abby, looking for any clues or letters from Airion Mistspeaker that might hint at where the next two scrolls are hidden. 

In the Abby, the party encounters ghouls and zombies, and the talkative ghost of the former Abbess, who directs them to the underground crypt. There, they recover notes and letters that may hold a clue to the location of the Deepwater Scroll, as well as some treasure for themselves. 

### Events

## Adventure 4: The Deepwater Scroll
### Session 4

Adrik, Samso, Brelith, and Aelar set out from the Purple Pig, armed with the location of the Deepwater Scroll, deciphered from the notes they found in the Pietravola Abby. The Drowned Tower, a place where the [Elemental Plane of Water](<../../cosmology/energy-realms/elemental-plane-of-water.md>) is close to the Material Plane, is their destination. After several days of travel across the plains, the party reaches the tower, where the swimming ability of Samso comes in handy. After battling blights outside the tower and making their way through the flooded, diseased tower, the party finds and cures an awakened tree, and the defeats a cursed water weird living in the corrupted fountain at the top of the tower. After removing the corruption from the water, they recover the scroll and other treasure from its hiding place, anchored in the [Elemental Plane of Water](<../../cosmology/energy-realms/elemental-plane-of-water.md>) with an immovable rod.

### Session 5

Adrik, Samso, Aglath, Aelar, and Brelith, hanging out at the Purple Pig, fend off a dire wolf attack on town. Brelith learns in town this may be connected to the dwarven ruins under Goldpeak Mountain, part of the same complex of extensive dwarven ruins as the Forge of Fire. After a brief and rather unsuccessful meeting with traveling merchant and caravan master, Quintus Percomia who has need of adventurers to help a group of centaurs to the south, the party decides to explore the dwarven ruins and the source of the dire wolf attacks. Finding the entrance to the mine, the party fights off death dogs, ankhegs, and a chuul before deciding to retreat to safety and rest before exploring further. 

### Session 6

While Brelith and Aglath return to town, Samso, Adrik, and Aelar head back to the mine to explore. At the entrance to the mine, they meet Oskar, a Dwarven Ranger, and Stoneclaw, his hyena companion. Continuing into the mines, they defeat a carrion crawler, subdue a giant subterranean lizard, manage to disable the haunted statue that is stirring up the local monster population, and find some Dwarven treasure (Thunderbrand and Coldguard). On the way back, some exploration turns up a small amount of mithril, which Aelar keeps.

## Adventure 6: The Cursed Tomb
### Session 7

Back in town, Adrik, Samso, Aglath, and Brelith, joined by Scordith, visit again with Quintus, where Aglath apologizes for his rude behavior before and the party learns more about the problems the centaurs are having. Apparently, the local water supply has been poisoned by a curse. The party heads south to investigate. After surviving oozes raining from the sky, and a wild boar charge, they meet the centaurs and head to investigate the cursed lake. There, they find the tomb of Xameia the Forsworn, a paladin of the Order of Twilight, sacred to the Night Queen, who forsook her oath out of a desire for greed and was cursed. She cannot rest until the temple of her order is restored to atone for her mistakes. The party agrees to take on this challenge, and Xameia subsides, freeing the lake of her influence for 30 days. After being rewarded by the centaurs, the party heads back to Voltara.

- Jun 09, 1747 DR: Scordith returns to Voltara while the others rest in the centaur camp, and is never seen from again. 
## Adventure 7: Orcs at the Lonely Watchtower
### Session 8

Returning from the centaur camp, Adrik, Samso, Brelith, and Aglath are attacked on the road by bandits, where they are joined by Oskar. The bandits are desperate for treasure to pay off demands of tribute from orc raiders, but quickly surrender when it is clear they are overmatched. After gathering some information, the party heads to the Lonely Watchtower, the raiding base of this group of orcs. There, the party makes their way through the tangleweed around the tower, defeats the orc guards, and ultimately kill Raluhk the Orog, the leader of this raiding band. Exploring the rest of the outpost, they rescue Ralvaz, a mine captain working north of Voltara who reports orc raids on numerous caravans bringing treasure from the mines to Voltara. The party then returns to Voltara with this news.

### Events

## Adventure 8: Iara’s Plea
### Session 9

After returning to Voltara from the orc’s camp in a ruined watchtower, Samso is approached by a troubled lizardfolk woman named Iara who is looking for help after the people of her village to the west mysteriously disappeared. Joining with Brelith, Aelar, and Adrik, the group heads to investigate. Traveling west, they find an empty lizardfolk village, and are attacked by shadowy creatures that look like evil echos of lizardfolk. They find the lair of these shadow creatures, where Aelar surprises and kills two guards with poisoned darts. In the lair, they confront and kill the leader of these shadow creatures.

### Session 10

After defeating the shadow lizardfolk leader, although no closer to understanding the cause of this disturbance, Adrik, Aelar, Brelith, and Samso return to Voltara. On the road, they are stopped by bugbears, who demand payment to continue. Refusing, the party attacks and defeats the bugbears, finding orders from Grumella the Vengeful of the Moon Skull clan demanding the capture for ransom of all travelers from the west.

### Events

## Adventure 9: The Lost Temple of the Order of Twilight
### Session 11

Returning to Voltara with news of kidnappings of messagers from Chardon,  Brelith, Aelar, Adrik, and Samso decide to tackle their promise to Xameia to restore the desecrated temple of the Order of Twilight. Brelith finds information about the probable location of this temple in the library in Voltara, and the party sets off into the wilderness in search of the ruins. Making their way into the hills southwest of Voltara, the party is ambushed at night by a large group of small, vicious humanoids with blue skin and giant rat pets, who try to grapple and drag them off. After driving these attackers off, the party regroups and continues towards the temple.

### Session 12  

Approaching the temple, Brelith, Aelar, Adrik, and Samso find an area of death where nothing seems to grow. Continuing to explore, they come upon the approach to the temple itself, and defeat several maw demons guarding the path. Continuing, they find the temple swarming with demonic influences, and face off against more demons in the ruins itself. 

### Session 13

After defeating the demons guarding the ruins, the Brelith, Aelar, Adrik, and Samso explore and find an entrance to a crypt below, which seems to be the source of the demonic influence. Climbing into the crypt, they are attacked by a cambion. After a challenging battle, they manage to prevail, and learn that the temple is the location of a portal to the Abyss, which must be closed before the temple can be cleansed. Gathering some treasures and items remaining in the crypt (including a necklace of spell storing and a cloak of twilight), they return to town to consider their next move. 

### Session 14

Back in Voltara,  Brelith, Aelar, Adrik, and Samso attempt to find someone who can help them close the Abyssal portal and cleanse the Temple of Twilight. They are directly to the priest Galius Filuso, an adventurer and traveler from Chardon interested in the history of the Order of Twilight as he attempts to restore it to its former glory. Traveling with Galius back to the temple, the party sets up to defend him for the 24 hours it will take to cast the Hallow spell and close the portal. The first wave of attackers -- minor demons and their minions --  are relatively easily defeated.

### Session 15

Continuing to defend the temple, in the middle of the night the remnants of the Xvart tribe, allies and servants of the demons, attack from the hidden entrance to the crypt. After they are defeated, as dawn approaches and the spell is nearly complete, a large, four-armed, clawed demon, a Glabrezu, steps from the portal and heads for Galius. The party is able to defeat it, however, and the spell is complete. As the portal closes, and the curse is lifted from the temple, Xameia can finally rest. In thanks for their efforts, an avatar of the Night Queen herself appears, and offers each member of the party a boon.

## Adventure 10: The Messenger and the Kobolds

### Session 16

Returning from the success of restoring the Temple of the Order of Twilight, Adrik, Brelith, Aelar, and Samso are invited to meet the proconsul, the governor of Voltara, and given permission to enter the walled city itself. After this meeting, they receive word a messenger has gone missing, and head out on a mission from Archivist Lyra to ransom the messenger from kobolds. While they are able to ransom the messenger, Amus, they realize that he does not have the map they need to locate the scroll: it has been taken by the kobolds. Leaving Amus in a well-hidden camp, the party deduces that the kobolds may try to get the map to Grumella. Searching for hidden exits from the lair, they find several, and set a careful ambush. With some clever planning, the ambush is a success and the scroll is recovered, after which the party returns to their camp to rest and plot their next move. 

### Events


- Jul 08, 1747 DR: The party arrives back in Voltara. 
- Jul 09, 1747 DR: The party meets the Proconsul, and Archivist Lyra tells them a messenger is missing. 
- Jul 10, 1747 DR: Adrik, Brelith, Aelar, and Samso random the messenger from the kobolds, but not the map they need to find the last scroll, the Skyborn Scroll.  
- Jul 11, 1747 DR: The party, with Aglath, ambushes the kobolds and retrieves the map to the Skyborn scroll. 

## Adventure 11: The Skyborn Scroll
### Session 17

Camped outside the kobold lair, Adrik, Brelith, Aelar, and Samso meet up with Aglath and contemplate their next move. The Skyborn scroll is thought to be located in Airion’s tower, a floating tower deep in the highest peaks of the Fiamatara mountains, near Blacksilver Peak, at the northern edge of the old Dwarven fortresses in these mountains. The party decides to head north. Heading north on the plains, they are attacked by a hobgoblin patrol returning to camp in the mountains, and nearly killed. Only some quick thinking from Samso, and an elemental summoned by Aelar while barely clinging to consciousness, keeps the party from ending up the prisoners of the hobgoblins. 

### Session 18

The party decides to move on quickly, after only a brief rest, trying to put some miles between the hobgoblin patrol route and themselves before camping for the night. The next day, they encounter their old companion Oskar on the plains, who has been traveling in this area with Stoneclaw. They decide to journey together for a time. Approaching the northern end of the mountains, they avoid a flash flood on the plains, and finally identify Blacksilver Peak and turn towards it. Finding a path up into the mountains, they encounter and defeat a frost giant who hates dwarves, and his pet remorhaz. Coming to some cliffs without an obvious way down, they meet a giant eagle who agrees to fly them to the old Dwarven road to Blacksilver Peak in exchange for a meal of giant goats.

### Session 19

After bargaining with the giant eagle, Oskar and Stoneclaw return to the plains, while Aelar, Aglath, Brelith, Adrik, and Samso travel along the Dwarven road towards Blacksilver Peak. On the way, they defeat a hunting party of basilisks. They find the entrance to an old Dwarven complex, which now seems to be inhabited by some other kind of beast or creature based on the piles of cast of bits of armor and clothes from dead victims in the entryway. 

### Session 20

Pressing further into the cave, the party finds it is now the lair of a pair of trolls, who are eventually defeated by Aglath’s burning hands. After navigating a chamber of regenerating stirges, the party finds a stair climbing up through the center of the mountain, and begin the long ascent to the top of Blacksilver Peak and hopefully Airion’s Tower and the scroll. During the ascent, they navigate (eventually) around a partial collapse of the stairs by use of the climbing abilities of Samso’s giant spider form.

### Session 21

Continuing to ascend the endless stairs, the party arrives in a broken chamber, seemingly a former waystation but in disrepair. Here, they are ambushed by roving black puddings; while Adrik’s armor is destroyed, they otherwise manage to survive the encounter and make their way to the top of the stair. Here, the party ascends to a former Dwarven outpost. Deciding to explore north, they find a large cavern with a glint of light above. Despite Samso’s ancestor’s warning that only woe will come of it, they decide to explore the light.

### Session 22  

Using summoned giant spiders to help explore the flash of light in the ceiling nearly 400’ above, the party faces predictably bad results, but do learn that there is a snowy landscape outside, although no way to access it from this small skylight. After a bit more aimless exploring, they find themselves face to face with some spirits of past wars, sword wraiths who are upset their stories have been forgotten, guarding what seems to be the exit from the Dwarven fortress. An attempted negotiation fails as the sword wraiths are not inclined to let them exit, but they are eventually defeated, and the party finds themselves looking out at a stormy glacier.

### Session 23

Exploring the snow and ice landscape at the top of Blacksiver Peak, the party finds tracks and a trail leading to a small cave complex, where they encounter Dinia, an old woman mysteriously living in this winter wasteland, and affectionately nicknamed Grandma Yoda by the party. She will help them find the tower, but only if they first take care of a yeti problem for her. After defeating an abominable yeti, they return to Dinia’s cave to rest before setting out in the predawn light to cross the glacier to the tower. While the glacier crossing is not without peril, with Dinia’s help they make it to a bridge leading across thin air to the tower entrance.

### Session 24

The party crosses the ice bridge, and encounters the guardians of the tower, a living statue of ice and its two ice fox companions. After managing to defeat these guardians, the party is faced with the puzzle of opening the door, which is locked with arcane sigils and runes. After solving the puzzle, the door swings open.

### Session 25

The party begins to explore the tower, passing through the grand illusion of the sky in the entrance room, and defeating a pair of animated suits of plate armor guarding the library. In the library they find some clues and treasure, and then proceed up, to the ruins of an alchemical laboratory. Here, they meet Mehrangeesa of Sulmana, a djinni trapped here with enchanted manacles. Mehrangeesa tells them some of the history of Airion, how different factions on the Elemental Plane of Air saw him as relatively harmless or a great evil to be destroyed, and told them of Zadkai, a warlock devoted to a great power on the Elemental Plane of Air who wanted to see all humans who would interfere with the Plane of Air destroyed. After being freed, he tells them he will be listening if they find a way to get in touch, gifts Aelar with the power of whirlwind punches, and disappears.

### Session 26

Ascending to the final floor of the tower, the party encounters Airion Mistspeaker himself, trapped in a magic circle and unable to retrieve the scroll. Tricked into helping him extract the scroll from the chest near him, Samso (in opposum form) hands the scroll over, only to have the illusion of Airion fade, and the ruined, undead form of Zadkai appear in his place. After summoning four dust mephits, Zadkai casts dimension door and vanishes onto the icy bridge. The dust mephits are easy to destroy, after which the party rushes to the ceiling where the perceptive eyes of Samso, guided by Brelith’s magic, pick out a small, running figure far below: Zadkai fleeing. Quickly conjuring two giant eagles to carry most of the party, while Aelar uses his monk magic to glide down the side of the tower, the party gives chase. In a climatic battle on the icy outskirts of the glacier, the Adrik manages to retrieve the air scroll from Zadkai’s grasp, but despite a well-placed stunning strike from Aelar, Zadkai vanishes just before he can be killed.

### Session 27

Spent after the battle, the adventurers decide to rest in the tower and head to Dinia’s after, when the sun is down and the glacier less prone to melt beneath their feet. As they rest, a glowing rune appears, growing and pulsing. Curiously and somewhat foolishly, Adrick and Aelar sit by it, noticing that it grows faster when they get closer. After half an hour, two living lightning bolts appear and attack. The party rushes into combat, and although Aelar is knocked out, they win and resume their rest. 

After a full sleep, the rune appears again, and they leave before it is activated, resources refreshed. They make it across the glacier without much trouble due to Samso and Brelith’s skills, and make it past a shifting crevice with Adrick’s (a little late) help. Before they reach Dinia’s, they encounter a wolf pack. Samso negotiates with his druidic and lizardfolk abilities, and Aelar suggests leading them to the frozen yeti corpse to eat. However, intelligent, magical alpha’s appear, interrupting. After tense bargaining, they get away, but not before Aelar acts foolishly and provokes a single parting attack. They reach Dinia’s and chat with her, learning more about Chardon’s history and the air scroll itself. Empowering by her stories, they leave on a route that the bard suggested, heading down the mountain. The session ends as an orc sentry sees them and blows its horn.

### Session 28

They begin battling the orcs, and the fight is going well until they knock out the orc leader to interrogate later and find that two of the orcs are healers who revive their leader again and again. After eliminating the clerics with a critical hit from Samso and a flurried series of stunning strikes from Aelar, they win, but one orc escapes. 

### Session 29 

After a brief interrogation with the orc leader, Aglath kills him after he taunts them and refuses to talk, then they find a place to rest. Experimenting with magic items from the tower leads to empowering Thunderbrand and summoning a roc bound to Adrick. They head back to Voltara on roc back and are attacked by wyverns but fight them off. They arrive in Voltara as heroes, and deliver the scroll to impressed Archivist Lyra after questioning her about the library’s responsibility with such a powerful artifact. They then get a break and several weeks of downtime to do what they please.

## Adventure 12: Prepare for War!
### Session 30

As they split up, Aglath and Adrick head to the pit fighting rings. Outside the Walled City, they dominate, but inside it, they face the fiercest competition they’ve seen. Aelar goes to find poisons for his ever growing collection, buying serpent poison and crawler mucus on the Black Market, and acquiring wyvern venom from the local alchemist.  Samso goes to the lizardfolk village for lilypad cakes and clues. He then returns to study in the library and concludes that his family’s disappearance and the shadow lizards are connected to the Shadowfell. Brelith scribes spell scrolls and receives a kind letter from his proud noble parents. As they meet up again in their new inn, the proconsul reveals that Grumella is threatening to destroy Voltara if they don’t turn in the adventurers. After much beard stroking and wise ribbits, they refuse and prepare for siege. Brelith sends messages to his mom, who agrees to send a small dwarven military force, the djinn, who refuses to fight but agrees to send help in another way when they call on him, and the roc agrees to help if they do him a favor, and they decide to help him soon. They then leave to recruit the centaurs, and begin to march across the open plain.

### Session 31

At night, the party is attacked by some kind of shadow creature while Samso is on watch. Although it is a tough battle, they win, and the shadow creature fades, but not before threatening Samso, saying, “stop asking questions, you fool!” The rest of the trip to the centaurs passes uneventfully, and at the centaur camp they speak with Herasto, the leader. After some convincing Herasto agrees to fight, but needs safe hunting grounds for his herd, and food for the winter,, if the warriors are going to fight. He suggests that if the party were to kill the manticores that are lairing in a nearby river valley, that would be a perfect place for his herd to spend the winter in safety. That evening, the party speaks with Theopheia, Herasto’s wife, who promises that should they succeed she may be able to help them reach their next destination with great speed. Setting out in the morning for the manticore valley, the party encounters a patrol of manticores that shower them with spikes. Despite a tough battle, they eventually prevail and prevent the manticores from reaching the lair with news of an attack. 

### Session 32 

After resting in the mountains, they follow an orc trail to the manticore hideout. Using the immovable rod, the party climbed down and surprised a manticore, hellhound, and several two-headed death dogs, and defeated them, with Adrick blocking their chance to raise the alarm. Unfortunately, Brelith’s thunderwave had alerted the others, and so they hid in the water and among the corpses to set an  ambush. After dealing with the scout, they headed deeper, finding the manticore leader and his henchman. Brelith conjured a thunderstorm, Samso summoned a flock of giant birds, Aglath fought against them with magic and javelins, while the others balanced on the leader’s back while striking him in a risky but deadly position. After a hard fight, the manticore succumbed to the heroes attacks, and even wounded, they quickly slayed the others. With the manticores dead, the cave was silent- save for a distant cry of help.

### Session 33

The party followed the sound and found two ragged villagers caged and being attacked by ravenous young manticores. Despite Samso’s intervention, Adrick and Aelar easily disposed of the small beasts, and they freed the imprisoned shepherds. With the rescues in tow, they went deeper into the caves, finding several druidic spell scrolls, a magic snake circlet (which fit awkwardly on Samso), a mysterious potion, and lots of coins. With the new treasure they left the caves, but ran into an orc patrol, bringing prisoners to the (now-dead) manticores. They fight them off, with Aglath swinging through orcs like jelly, Brelith striking down attackers and saving the prisoners, Aelar chasing down war wolves with supernatural speed, Adrick going one on one with a orcish mage-warrior, and Samso finally used heat metal, with less than spectacular results, before transforming and dueling down a dire wolf. They freed the prisoners, and returned to the centaurs with the good news. The session ended as they set off to fulfill their deal with the roc and return his egg in exchange for his help.

### Events

- Sep 15, 1747 DR: Aglath, Adrik, Samso, Brelith, and Aelar are summoned by the proconsul of Voltara, who informs them [Grumella](<../../people/orcs/grumella.md>) has demanded their surrender or the city will be attacked. The party agrees to organize a defense.

## Adventure 13: Roc and Roll
### Session 34

Aided by a spell scroll given to them by Theopheia, the party sets off for the mountains in  the north, where the roc Silver Feathers of the Storm Cloud, Thunder and Lightning, is waiting anxiously. The party learns that a band of kobolds may know the location of the stolen egg, and go speak with them. After some negotiation, they give the kobolds 500 gp in exchange for information, and are lead to a cave entrance. The kobolds guides flee while the party fights off an earth elemental solider and two gargoyles. Entering the cave, they proceed to a chamber filled with purple crystals and a pulsing, oozing stone of some kind. Emerging from the ground to attack is a dao, an earth genie, who wants to petrify the roc egg, as petrified roc eggs are prized by the dao. After a tough fight, the party drives him back to his native plane, the Elemental Plane of Earth.

### Session 35

Exploring the crystal chamber, the party destroys the pulsing stone, collapsing the portal to the Elemental Plane of Earth. They then search for the roc egg, finding it in a chamber north of the purple stone chamber. Turning to leave, they encounter mephits and earth elementals in the passageway to the surface who attempt to steal the egg and flee. Despite a few close moments they are killed and driven off without damage to the egg itself. As the party emerges from the caves, the rocs fly down to reclaim the egg, and leave the party with a feather of thanks, allowing them to summon the roc at need, once only.

### Events


- Sep 20, 1747 DR: Use scroll of wind walking from centaurs to travel north to the roc's territory. Spend the evening and learn they need to rescue a roc egg to get the roc's aid in battle. The rocs direct them to a nearby kobold lair for clues. 
- Sep 21, 1747 DR: Party speaks with kobolds and bribes them for information. 
- Sep 22, 1747 DR: Kobolds lead party to an earth elemental lair, and flee. Party fights guards, then explores lair, defeats dao, and emerges at dawn with the egg, which is gathered by the rocs. Party then spends the day making a boat to return to Voltara quickly, having been promised the roc's aid in battle. 
## Adventure 14: Death to Grumella!
### Session 36

The party spends a day constructing a wooden raft in order to speed their journey back to Voltara. After a week’s raft trip, they return to the city to find preparations for war are well underway. A war council, with Marcus Tuso, the human commander of the Voltara legion; Galius Filuso, priest of the Night Queen and representative of the priests of the Eight Divines in the city; Orin Strongaxe, Brelith’s cousin and war leader of the dwarf army that has arrived; and Aris, a centaur, leader of the centaur war band, is underway. The party joins in, and decides that more information is needed. A scouting expedition heads towards the orc camp, where Aelar is  with every spell and trick the party can muster, letting him move over 15 miles per hour, with massive stealth boosts and resistance to all sorts of things. Aelar scouts the camp, finding 3000 orcs, three hill giants, and many ogres, before being caught in a crossbow trap the hill giants had set up. With a mad dash, he flees and makes it back to camp alive. Returning to town, the party prepares for battle.

### Session 37

The morning the orc armies arrive, the plan is launched. Merangeesha, the djinni, summons a wind of epic proportions that keeps arrows from reaching the walls, and keeps the manticores grounded. The roc arrives, and the dwarves and centaurs prepare to drive off ogre support so the part can kill the hill giants. The hill giants, it turns out, have split into three groups, with one hill giant in each group, and so the party divides as well: Adrik and Aris take one, Agalth and Samso another, and Brelith and Aelar the last. Everyone succeeds, and the hill giants are defeated. While the party is healing and taking a short rest, the orc army starts launching diseased orcs into the city, bringing pestilence and poison. Worried that flying to clear the catapults would leave the roc and the party exposed, they decide instead to take the fight to Grumella herself, seeking a decisive end to the conflict. 

The roc takes the party to Grumella’s command center, where they attack her and her guards and lieutenants. Although many guards die quickly, Grumella herself seems resistance to death and each time she falls, she rises again, until in the end a lightning strike from Samso’s storm, miraculously maintained through many hits during the battle, and boosted by the djinn’s winds and thunder, brings her down permanently. 

After the battle, the party celebrates in Voltara, and is promised rewards and fame. As the dwarves and centaurs return to home, they learn that Brelith’s homeland has been suffering from dangers on its southern border, and they decide to go investigate next.

### Events


- Sep 28, 1747 DR: Arrive in Voltara after sailing downriver in makeshift boat. War council. Leave to scout.

## Adventure 15: Meeting the Parents (Brelith Edition)
### Session 38

The party spends a month in Voltara, and are the talk of the town. They are gifted a manor inside the walls by the Proconsul, and spend time training and enjoying the life of a hero in the city. Once the legions from the south arrive to protect to the city, they leave, heading east towards the mountains of Brelith’s home. As they head east, they first pass through the farmlands and pastures of the Voltara hinterlands, until they come to a small fort on a river crossing, beyond which is mostly wild. They are warned at the fort that people have gone missing heading east, especially a high ranking officer who was supposed to bring messages to the garrison camps to the east, and to watch for danger. The next day as they head across the plains, they are attacked by a band of 20 orcs. Despite a few challenges, the orcs are defeated.

### Session 39

Continuing east, the party is ambushed at night by a smaller group of sneakier orcs, who are also killed. A few days later, they come to the garrison camp, where they meet the commander and tell her about the orcs. While they did not track down the orc’s camp, they give her enough information that her soldiers can take care of it. Deciding to travel quickly and avoid further engagement with Chardonian soldiers, they turn south before reaching the last border fort of the Chardonian Empire. Crossing the river on the border of the empire, they enter a light forest on the foothills of the mountains, where Samso notices people are following them. They call out, and a group  of unusual humans -- not Chardonians -- steps from the trees. They are wearing armor and carrying brightly painted shields, most with unkempt blond or red hair, pale skin, and wicked looking spears and axes. The group leds them to their village along secret paths, where they met Hakar, the leader of the village. He questions them a bit, and seems to press them on whether they are working for Chardon and whether Chardon is preparing to attack, but is reassured by the news that the army buildup was to protect against orcs. He also hints that something up north is driving things south, for their woods have recently been invaded by spiders. He says his scouts can lead them safely through the woods if the party deals with the spiders, which they agree to do.  

### Session 40

The party heads north where they encounter a spider ambush. Despite the webs and traps and difficult terrain they defeat the spiders. Aelar sneaks ahead and sees a spider nursery, which they reluctantly decide to sneak around. On the far side of the nursery, they see a cave covered in webs, and as they enter to explore an enormous spider queen emerges before them, ready to attack.

### Session 41

The party engages in battle with the giant spider in her lair. Shortly into the battle, with Aelar wounded, Samso turns him into a giant ape, and Brelith creates a massive stone club for him to use. The giant ape makes quick work of the spider queen. As the battle ends, Samso notices claw marks and acid burns on the dead spider. After leaving the spider lair, the party returns to the Northerner village, where they participate in the pig wrestling games (involving grappling your opponent while riding a large pig, to see who gets knocked off first). The next morning they travel south with a scout to lead them to the entrance to the dwarven kingdoms. Along the way, they stop to investigate some elven ruins and are almost killed by banshees. The session ends as they arrive at the gates. 

### Events


- Nov 10, 1747 DR: Aglath, Adrik, Aelar, Brelith, and Samso leave Voltara to head east to investigate what is happening in Brelith's homeland, after a month of rest, trusting their new manor to a well paid steward.

## Adventure 16: Why Is Everything So Cold?
### Session 42

Entering the city of gems, Zarkandur, the party meets Brelith’s parents and enjoys a feast. Afterward, they learn about the mystery of the freezing dwarven cities, and decide to go south to investigate. Coming to the now frozen and abandoned city of Tumukhar, they encounter and fight a small group of ice mephits. 

### Session 43

Continuing to explore the frozen city of Tumukhar, the party passes through a warren of frozen homes and encounters the undead remains of a frozen dwarf. Continuing towards the exit to the mountains, and possible information in the Stoneborn villages of the high mountain peaks, they encounter an ice troll and a number of ice mephits. Managing to kill all the ice mephits and the troll before any escape, they continue out the door, narrowly avoiding an avalanche trap. The session ends with the party looking across the freezing wastelands of the high tundra. 

### Session 44

The party struggles with the extreme cold of the mountains, but manages to find a place for a rest in a safe cave, hiding from a passing frost giant riding a mammoth. The next morning they set out, following the track to the stoneborn village. The terrain is difficult and slow going, so eventually they decide to ride giant eagles summoned by Samso. Along the way, they see a group of seemingly frozen humanoids following the same trail, and stop to investigate. They discover these are some kind of frost-cursed creatures who immediately attack, occasionally chanting odd things about how the ice will save everyone. After the battle, Adrik picks up a frozen ring from one of their fingers, and as the ring melts the party is teleported to the entrance to an ice cave. Here, they find two snowy owlbears that they befriend with bribes of food. The session ends with the party exploring the trash room in the cave complex.

### Session 45

The party continues to explore the cave complex, encountering another beserk humanoid who seemingly cannot die. They run around for a while, confused, trying to avoid him. Eventually they discover a passage leading to the bedroom complex, which crosses a crevasse of ice on a wooden plank. Finally they manage to trap the beserker at the bottom of the crevasse, and explore. They find a room with a stone floor, and a stone chalice in which a cold blue flame burns. 

### Session 46

Eventually realize that putting out the flame stops the beserkers endless life feature. Brelith uses stone shape to melt away the stone chalice, which extinguishes the fire, and allows the berserker to be quickly killed. Heading into the snow, the party decides to travel across the glacier towards the location where the Stoneborn village seems to be. On the way, they are attacked by a group of ice humanoids using druid-like powers. While they manage to drive them off, one gets away. The party continues to the Stoneborn village, where they see a lone Stoneborn meditating.

### Session 47

The party meets Moondweller, the Stoneborn. From him, they learn that while the frost giants once were valued trading parties, some have turned to the side of evil and are working for a hag, Morgana Frostclaw. The hag has taken control of the ice magic buried at the heart of the glacier and is using it to freeze everything. To stop it, they must kill the hag, or at least free the ice magic. 

The party sleeps, and departs in the morning to Vangebekkr, the frost giant castle. They approach with moderate stealth, and decide to sneak around the back and climb up to the roof. Adrik and Aelar reach the top first, and comes face to face with a giant frost giant skeleton. After some fast attacking and a well-timed stun from Aelar, the giant dies before it can sound the alarm.

### Session 48

The party attempts to sneak down into the castle, where hijinx ensue. While searching the throne room, they are attacked by piercers that look like icicles. Although the giant eagles Samso summoned to fly to the roof keep most of the party from taking damage, the noise is enough to attract the attention of the giants having dinner below. After a bit of a mad scramble, attempting to hide, the giant who comes to investigate finds Adrik and Brelith hiding under the bed. While trying to pull Adrik out, Brelith banishes him. In the minute they have before he returns, Aelar uses minor illusion to sound like the voice of the giant yelling that he found dwarves, the party first thinks about hiding again, and then decides to sneak down the stairs to the dining room, hoping to be missed in the chaos as the rest of the giants rush up the stairs.

Despite magical aid in hiding, this fails, and as they reach the bottom of the stairs the giant king sees Adrik and yells. While the rest of the party dodges under the table and into the corridor, Adrik jumps out the window and dodges boulders in the snow. Eventually the party regroups at the front entrance, but not before all five giants in the castle are alerted to their presence and chasing after them. Fortunately, the party manages to mount and coax the mammoths to run into the snow, losing the giants in the process.

Despite the cold, Samso is able to find a safe place for them to pass an uneventful night, before waking up to plot their return to the castle.

### Session 49

Regrouping, the party approaches the castle by stealth, again. Climbing has mixed success, but a well-placed silence spell keeps the door from making noise, and allows them to kill the ice mephits and the frost giant guard without the alarm being sounded. Aided by magic (Pass without Trace), they sneak to the top of the stairs, that lead down to an ice cave. Kill two more ice mephits in a cone of silence, preventing them from sounding the alarm.

At the bottom of the stairs, two frost giant skeletons wait. Kill one, and Brelith banishes the other. In the minute they have before the giant returns, free an imprisoned frost giant, who refused to work with Morgana. When the giant skeleton returns, it is immediately dispatched. The rest of the imprisoned giants are freed, who proceed upstairs to retake their castle while the party heads into the ice caves to find and kill Morgana.

### Session 50

Proceed through the freezing ice caves which make up Morgana’s lair. Convince a chained frost giant guard to go help the rest of his kin retake the castle. Avoid a fight with a frost giant zombie. Trigger a glyph of warding trap, and then get attacked by a were-polar bear, one of Morgana’s allies. Eventually find Morgana, and kill her, with Adrick getting the final blow and taking revenge for his childhood trama, but not before he is cursed with lycanthropy.

### Session 51

Return to the Dwarven city of Zarkandur, now freed from its winter curse. Big celebration, and Brelith’s parents throw a feast. Adrik and Aelar spent time competing in the fighting pits, while Samso and Brelith do some research. After a few weeks, the party leaves to return to Voltara. On the way, Adrik turns to a werebear and must be knocked unconscious. Brelith cures him the next morning.

After defeating were-Adrik, the party arrives at a Chardonian fort on the northern border. Samso convinces the commander of the fort that the party are amazing heroes who can turn into dragons and kill deadly enemies with a glance, so she insists they try to find out who is stealing all their cattle. Their first scouting attempt fails miserably.

## Adventure 17: What do you mean, we have to kill a dragon?!?
### Session 52

After regrouping, the party heads upriver and discovers a small bullywug village, that appears to have been stealing the Chardonian cattle. The party attacks and nearly wipes out the entire village before realizing that perhaps they should have talked first. After some limited communication with drawings and diagrams – and the threat of a giant froghemoth potentially attacking them – they realize the bullywugs were driven from their home by a dragon. The bullywugs communicate that if the dragon is killed, all will be forgiven.

### Session 53

The party returns to the Chardonian fort and leaves the problem of the nearly-exterminated bullwugs in the commander’s hands, and heads north to track the dragon. Along the way, after about a week’s journey upriver, they meet some Northerners, who are gathered at a council to discuss what to do about the very same dragon. 

After some discussion with the Northerner council, the party decides to travel with Izkir, a priest of Bita, a bear spirit, who will lead them to the lair. After almost 10 days, they come to the edge of the Blackwater Fens, where the dragon lair is.

### Session 54

The party sets off into the Blackwater Fens, with Adrick leading the way and Samso keeping an eye out for danger. They pass an ancient stone marker, about 60’ high, marking friendship between the elves and the humans, but it has fallen on its side. Continuing into the swamp, they make camp for the night.

In the middle of the night, the dragon, scouting its territory, finds them, and surprises the camp with a blast of its acid breath. While perched on a tree and taunting them, demanding they join its service or die, Adrik and Aelar manage to get on top of it, and are hasted by Izkir’s magic. As they beat on the dragon from above – and an attempted polymorph of Aelar into a T-rex is less successful than hope – the dragon takes to the air, watching the spellcasters and attempting to disruption their concentration. Still, Adrik and Aelar do considerable damage before Samso’s conjured air elemental turns against the party as he falls unconscious, and the dragon flees, wounded.

Rather than attempt to rest here, where the dragon is alerted to their presence, the party hikes overnight to the stone monument, and spends the day repairing it using the plan suggested by the Dwarven gods, at Brelith’s questioning with the Divination spell. With the monument restored, the party finally rests safely. 

The next day is spent scrying and scouting, trying to assess the situation before heading for the lair to attack and kill the dragon. 

### Session 55

The party makes a plan and finally confronts Nymthrax in his lair. The battle is fiercely fought, and the party is nearly killed by the searing acid of his breath. However, in the dragon’s moment of triumph, with everyone but Brelith unconscious on the battlefield, Brelith summons lightning to strike down the dragon. 

The party then loots his hoard, finding a vast collection of art, gems, coin, and treasure from throughout history. 

### Session 56

The party spends a considerable amount of time organizing treasure and figuring out how to transport the entire hoard. With that accomplished, they head south, saying goodbye to Izkir, and then meeting again with the bullywugs to tell them their home is safe and return some treasure the dragon stole from them. 

A few weeks later, they arrive back in Voltara, greeting by Julius their steward.

## Adventure 18: What’s at the Bottom of that Vast, Dark Chasm?
### Session 57

The party spends some time in Voltara. They sell treasure, decorate their manor, and purchase an extradimensional vault from an eccentric dwarven artificer. They also receive letters: 
- from Dinia, saying that Arion’s tower is gone; 
- from Iara, the lizardfolk, saying her people are heading south to Lake Valandros; 
- from Archivist Lyra, saying that the elemental scrolls were well-received, that should they find any more of Arion’s treasure they should come to Chardon to sell it, and also asking if they would look into the disappearance of another group of adventurers in the Goldpeak Mines. 

With their treasure protected by magic and with Julius paid and the manor restocked, the party heads out to Goldpeak Mines, where they find a mysterious abandoned camp with dead bodies.

### Session 58

Hearing noises from the tent at the abandoned camp, Samso lights the fabric on fire, which is encouraged to spread by Adrik’s ability to control flames. As the fire burns, a dwarf emerges but quickly dissolves into a pair of gibbering mouthers. The party fights them, and the tentacled rats that emerge from the dead bodies of a pair of horses. Despite Adrik’s mind being frequently overcome by the gibbering whispers calling out to Vilaxes, the party defeats these creatures and heads into the mines. Easily descending the cliff walls, the party finds a ruined ladder of massive, thick braided rope at the bottom. Charging ahead into a rough-hewn passage, Adrik is attacked and ambushed by a Cloaker, which summons two carrion crawlers to aid it. Despite its annoying grapple, the cloaker is driven off, and the carrion crawlers are killed by Aelar as they try to flee. 

### Session 59

The Silver Tempests continue down the passage, finding a campfire with the surviving Chardonians: Alton, the halfling rogue from long ago, and Cassia, a human paladin. They claim that some weird aberrations are living in the depths; their companion, a dwarf, was corrupted and went mad. After a rest, the party joins Cassia and Alton to explore further. 

After traveling some distance into the depths, the party finds some guards, twisted tentacled horrors watching the passageway. Between Samso’s wall of thorns and Brelith’s shatter spell, combined with the usual strength of the melee fighters, the guards die quickly. But it does not matter that the guards do not sound the alarm, as shatter alerts the base anyway. 

Entering the lair, Brelith falls into a quicksand trap and needs most of the rest of the party to rescue him; Aelar is left free to run up the wall and chase down some kobolds who are watching. One of the kobolds is pretending to be an acolyte of the fire god, and speaks freely to the party when he realizes they were the instigators of that con. From him, they learn that a beholder has taken over the kobold den, driving them to make a massive statue to his glory. 

Sneaking through the lair, the party encounters a few guards, attempting to trick them into believing they are here to worship Vilaxes, the beholder. This fails, and Adrick, Brelith, Cassia, and Samso are quickly chained and tossed into pits. Aelar and Alton, hidden, follow, and then launch an attack on the guards. A fight ensues, during which everyone escapes from their pits. 

The party confronts the beholder Vilaxes in a massive cavern dominated by a huge statue of a beholder walking on two legs, made of precious metals, random dungeon detritus, and broken weapons and armor. The fight seems to be going badly, with Aelar and Alton charmed, and Adrik and Cassia about to succumb to petrification, when Adrik uses a wish to remove all status effects from the party. Hoping to keep the beholder’s attention in his earth elemental form, Samso begins attacking the statue, cracking it in half, and drawing the beholder’s rage. While Samso is the focus of every blast of magic, and eventually succumbs to the death ray, Adrick strikes down Vilaxes with Thunderbrand. Brelith is then able to quickly cast revivify, bringing Samso back from the dead, and later restore Cassia as well. 

### Session 60

Back in Voltara, the Silver Tempest enjoys the rewards of their status and reputation. Brelith apprentices himself to the chef at Finoc Small’s tavern, the Wandering Toad, learning to cook, and opening a restaurant, Cleric Cooks. Adrik goes on a binge of pit fighting and gambling, managing to end up with a small profit. Samso travels to visit with Iara at the lizardfolk community near Lake Valandros, and learns more about the mysterious attacks. Alton opens a boisterous tavern and dive bar outside the city walls, called the Rogue’s Range, with axe throwing for patrons. 

Four months later, the Silver Tempest hosts a party, a grand opening for Cleric Cooks. Many old friends are there, thanks to Samso’s new magic ability to teleport via plants: Dinia, from the north; Brelith’s parents and some other dwarves of Zarkandur; and Aris and some other centaurs, who are leaving on the next stop in their migration and have come to say goodbye. It is a big success.

## Adventure 19: Saving Grandma Yoda (This Shit’s Kinda’ Fishy)

### Session 61

Mabist comes knocking on the door of the Tempest Towers. Both Samso and Adrik are a bit suspicious of this armored visitor before we learn Grandma Yoda was captured. We retrieve Alton from his violent dive bar. In misty forms the party flies to Suwi, a distant village near the coast, where they meet the village priest, and ask about rumors of the Havoc Host, a mercenary group that was involved in kidnapping Dinia. The priest introduces the party to Clara, a teenaged girl whose brother was kidnapped a few days ago by the Havoc Host, just upriver near a small lake.

The next morning the party travels upriver to the lake. Finding the logging camp where Clara’s brother was taken, they follow a trail along the lakeshore, coming to a rocky clearing where the ruins of a castle overlook the lake. The party manages to ambush a group of slimy minions, and quickly dispatch them, knocking them out and binding them. 

Searching the ruins, Samso finds a concealed tunnel leading underground. Following the tunnel, the party emerges into the barracks of the Havoc Host. Mabist is disguised as a slimy minion; Samso turns into an earth elemental; and Adrik busts down the door. A battle ensues, in which the Havoc Host are soundly beaten. Convinced that Mabist is one of the Ithu’rax’s servants, the mercenaries are reluctant to surrender, until Mabist attempts to surrender himself, convincing them that something strange is going on. At this point, the mercenaries surrender, and are disarmed and convinced to make a better life for themselves opening a franchise of Brelith’s restaurant by Adrik and Mabist. 

The party learns the layout of the tunnels from the mercenaries, and begins to explore, carefully navigating around cracking parts of the tunnels that drop rocks on their heads with a misstep. After navigating through the tunnels for some time, Samso hears sobbing from a room to the south. Here, the party discovers the dead body of an adventurer, and the ghost of Milo Kentbrush, who was sure he could kill the aboleth, but was ambused by the annoying slime servants. The party finds his arrow of aberration slaying, and takes it with them. Milo follows, tied to the arrow.

The party manages to quietly navigate the flooded caverns, emerging into the aboleth’s lair, where they see a psychically controlled Dinia waiting for them. She attacks, and Ithu’rax the aboleth emerges from a central pool, joining the battle. The battle is a challenge. Ithu’rax manipulates his foes physical form, turning ligaments to jelly and lungs to gills, all of which make it difficult for the party to land a blow. Alton, although set up with the arrow of aboleth slaying, misses his shot; Mabist manages to grapple the aboleth with a giant force hand, but is targeted by the aboleth’s anger and eventually knocked unconscious and dropped into the cursed waters at the center of the cave. Samso spends the combat as an earth elemental; while he does not sustain much damage, he is also repeatedly driven back and unable to land a solid blow. It is only Samso’s conjured dragon, and Adrik’s seemingly endless ability to absorb the strikes of the aboleth’s tentacles, that save the party and lead to victory. 

With the aboleth killed, Dinia returns to herself, and appoints herself the caretaker of the now slowly recovering slime servants. The party searches the cavern, and notices that there are numerous sigils carved in the ceiling of the cave that match those found in the abandoned lizardfolk villages of Samso’s homeland. Dinia speaks of the Umbral Convenant as the source of the sigils, and claims the aboleth was commanded to build an army for them. 

With this news, the party gathers the treasure, and prepares to return to Voltara to seek more information about the Umbral Convenant.

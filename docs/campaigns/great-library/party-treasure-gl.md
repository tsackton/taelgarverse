700 gp (from Lyra)
Three pieces of columns from the chapel have been moved here, and arranged in a triangle. Stacked in a small pile are 7 silver trade bars (10 lb each, 100 gp each), marked with a Dwarven stamp of [Nidzahar](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/nidzahar.md>). 

## On Display in Manor

In the center of the pedestal is a marble bust of an elven princess (about 3 feet tall), which is an exquisite rare art object but weighs about 300 pounds.

A statue, about 3' high, made of obsidian and decorated with silver wire and small red garnets, of a dragon (rare art object). 

A chess set, the pieces representing air elementals (white) and earth elementals (black) (exquisite uncommon art object).

On the second layer are four small stone carvings, one each of a fire, water, earth, and air elemental (uncommon art object each).

Extradimensional vault

## Sold in Voltara

A wooden statue of an eagle, about 1 foot high, has been partially eaten away by acid. However, the perfect pair of aquamarine eyes (rare gemstones, 1400 average value) and the six mother-of-pearl talons (uncommon gemstones, 420 gp average value) are salvageable. On the third pillar is a collection of gems (8 gems: 2 common, 4 uncommon, 2 rare). *3300 gold, to Quintus Percomia*

The top of the stone block has been polished smooth and has a shallow indentation, in which sits four gems: two diamonds (exquisite very rare), a star sapphire (exquisite rare), and a fire opal (exquisite rare). These are labeled "The Crown Jewels of Volganis".  With the gems is a relatively plain silver circlet (uncommon art object, but worth a lot more to a collector). *6000 gold, to Inectos Tintio*

Leaning against the rest of the treasure is a glaive, made of bone and wood. The wood itself is weakened by acid, but hanging off the top is a necklace, a silver chain with mother-of-pearl between the chain links, and a pendant made from the skull of small bird with gold inlay and freshwater pearls for eyes (rare art object, 1000 gp average value) *1000 gp to Eldeth Redhammer*

Alone on one pillar is an exquisitely crafted necklace: the chain is made of fine gold, and each of the six pendants hanging from the chain is an intricately crafted shape looking like flowing rock encasing rubies (exquisite very rare art object). *10000 to Eldeth Redammer*

## Given to Bullywugs

- Fourteen woven baskets of marsh reeds have nearly completely decayed on the side of the treasure pile. Spilling out from them are about 40,000 bits of stone, seeds, and other meaningless trinkets, broken shells, and trash. Mixed among these are six copper trinkets of frogs about the size of a palm, with tiny green emeralds for eyes, surprisingly fascinating in craft and appearance (exquisite common art objects, average value 1200 gp). (Nymthrax)
- A ceramic potion bottle with a spider painted on the outside, containing a (Bullywug) potion of climbing. Next to it is another ceramic bottle with an ear painted on it, containing a (Bullywug) potion of comprehension.
- Scattered among the muck are 14 freshwater pearls of various quality (all uncommon gemstones; 9 regular, 2 inferior, 3 exquisite; 1120 gp average value)

## Given Galius Filuso

A collection of 13 holy symbols, all some variant on the Night Queen's symbol, mostly made of silver (each is a common art object). Mixed in among them is one that seems to shine more strongly, and has a open hand motif, as if saying "stop", intermixed with the normal Night Queen symbol (Twilight Emblem). *Exchanged for casting Glyph of Warning with Summon Celestial*

## Sold at Market

*5000 gp total*

On the other side of the raised dais is an elaborate helm, probably ceremonial, decorated with moonstone (uncommon art object).

Laying in front of the bust is a ceremonial longsword, carved with Elvish runes (describing the history of the bearer, who seemed to have lived more than a thousand years ago, and fought in the wars of the Downfall). The hilt is decorated with amber, and the blade is silvered (exquisite rare art object).

Haphazardly piled on top of the coins are a dozen Deno'qai spears and shields. Most (10) of the spears are uncommon trade goods (total average value: 150 gp), the other two are a matched pair of exquisitely made, long hafted spears inland with silver forming a pattern that looks like a tree growing up the haft (legendary trade goods, 700 gp average value). The shields are all rare trade goods, of standard Deno'qai make and style (400 gp average value). (1250 gp total)

Mixed in with some rotting cloth are three silver hand mirrors of Deno'qai origin, each shaped in the representation of a different animal's head (bear, trout, hawk). These are uncommon art objects (average value 1500 gp)

On the other side of the table is a collection of 8 beautiful clay urns, each intricately painted with a different scene from nature. Each is about 1 foot high and fairly delicate (4 common art objects, 2 uncommon art objects, 1 exquisite common art object, 1 exquisite uncommon art object).

## Magic

Neatly stored in a potion belt are three red, bubbling potions. These are all Chardonian healing potions, one superior, and one supreme. 

Next to the coins is a silver potion vial that faintly shimmers and seems almost translucent, containing a potion of invisibility. An arrow lined with elvish script also sits next to the coins (Arrow of Demon Slaying)

Orb of Time.

Lying in the center and clearly the centerpiece of the collection is a staff of dark wood (Staff of the Swamplands).

The Drankorian section is spare, containing only a single item standing on a custom-crafted pedestal etched with acid: a crystal ball. This is a Crystal Ball of True Seeing, of Drankorian origin.

Next to them, a solid metal, watertight scroll case, with faint, faded script on the outside, containing a scroll of Planar Ally. 
 
There is also a short metal wand, with what looks like a burst of fireworks on the end (Wand of Pyrotechnics).

The centerpiece of the collection is clearly a plain looking ring, with three small diamonds set into a silver band. While at first glance this seems ordinary, if you look at a diamond closely, it seems to contain infinite reflections (Ring of Three Wishes).

Hanging from the stone pedestal is a shimmering leather belt, made of some unusual scaled material (Volganis Dragonhide Belt). Also hanging is an amulet in the shape of a stylized shield, made of silver and turquoise (Amulet of Protection).

On a raised dais on top of the altar sits a bound book, its cover made of metal and etched with a depiction of what looks like a humanoid form made out of clay. The pages are also made of very thin sheets of metal (Manual of Clay Golems). There is no title.

Next to the book is a ceramic scroll case, watertight, marked with holy symbols of the [Eight Divines](<../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena.md>). Inside is a scroll of summon celestial.

A clay and river stone pipe (Bullywug), functioning as a pipe of remembrance.

# Episode 1: The Merfolk Visitor
*In which [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>), [Wazir](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/wazir.md>), and [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>) uncover a mysterious plot involving a strange ship, a Sentient Ocean, and merfolk.*

PCs: [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>), [Wazir](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/wazir.md>), [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>)

### 23 July 1747
The summer of 1747 has been strange, with unusual events noted in the harbor: a phantom ship docking one night, a massive creature of epic proportions disturbing the normal bioluminescent glow of the harbor, a day when no fish could be found anywhere along the coast. 

But the strangest event of this month happened on July 23rd, the day a ship came to port, racing against the tide, with no obvious means of propulsion. Intercepted by [Wazir](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/wazir.md>), the owner of the Leviathan, [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>), a tattooed [Lizardfolk](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) outcast, and [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>), a noted fisherman and deep sea diver, the ship was a vessel for a merfolk expedition sent to recover a drop of Sentient Ocean stolen from their home. While water elementals and twisted fish-like humanoids attacked and killed most of the merfolk aboard, Turk, [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>)’s shark companion, managed to help steer the merfolk ship to safety. 

Soon after, [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>), [Wazir](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/wazir.md>), and [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>) were able to track the bottled ocean, with the aid of [Illius](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/illius.md>)’s compass (the surviving merfolk), to a tidal cave beneath the cliffs to the west of [Hamri](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/hamri.md>), connecting to a long-abandoned abandoned seawatch tower. After defeating the last of the water elementals, [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>), [Wazir](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/wazir.md>), and [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>) were able to recover the drop of Sentient Ocean and return it safely to [Illius](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/illius.md>), who claimed that marids from the [Elemental Plane of Water](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-plane-of-water.md>) had been after the ocean for generations, and believed that one finally found a way to penetrate the defenses to steal a drop. 

In the chest with the vial of Sentient Ocean was also a scroll of written notes, in some kind of code, and a silver amulet of a strange design. [Wazir](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/wazir.md>) took the scroll to attempt to decipher its meaning, wondering if indeed the phantom ship brought someone new to town involved in the schemes of the marids of the plane of water.

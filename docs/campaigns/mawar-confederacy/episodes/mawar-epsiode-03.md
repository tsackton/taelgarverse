# Episode 3: The Tomb of Yerkir-khor
*In which [Kaleho](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/kaleho.md>), [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>), [Nerissa](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/nerissa.md>), and [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>) head inland to find a missing treasure hunter, and uncover the lost tomb of Yerkir-khor in the process*

PCs: [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>), [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>), [Kaleho](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/kaleho.md>), [Nerissa](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/nerissa.md>)

### 23 October 1747
*Evening*. [Kaleho](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/kaleho.md>), the [human](<../../../species/humans/humans.md>) sailor, is in town and having dinner with [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>) on the beach when [Orden](<../../../people/mawarans/orden.md>) approaches, asking for help. His daughter, recently returned from a 10 year absence, has gone up the [Mirmir](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/rivers/mirmir.md>) river hunting for treasure and is missing. [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>) and [Kaleho](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/kaleho.md>) tentatively agree to help.

### 24 October 1747
*Morning*. The next morning they go to discuss with [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>) up in the towers ([Wazir](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/wazir.md>) is busy and cannot help). While having breakfast, an older woman, [Nerissa](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/nerissa.md>), who has recently claimed a nearby tower arrives to introduce herself and agrees to come along in search of adventure and stories. 

In town, [Abelard](<../../../people/mawarans/abelard.md>) the singer, who often hangs around the Leviathan, mentions that he thinks this woman headed up the [Mirmir](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/rivers/mirmir.md>) but doesn’t have any other information. However, the trail is clear enough and the party follows. 

### 26 October 1747
*Midday*. After a couple of days journey into the deep forests in the interior, the party finds a partially buried temple or structure, with writing in Terran stating “Here lies Yerkir-khor the Undaunted, Prince of Earth, Lord of the Rock Below, and Guardian of the Crystal Skies,” as well as clear evidence that someone has entered recently. 

Following, the party deals with a blade trap, gargoyles that come alive and attack while trying to activate some large snake-headed statue, and a quicksand trap, before arriving at the entrance to the main tomb or hall of Yerkir-khor. Here, they find more writing, also in Terran, “Faithful of Yerkir-khor, be blessed with the wisdom of your lord! Unfaithful, flee now or be entombed forever in his majestic presence!” 

After crawling past a lightning trap, the party descends to the final room, where a massive stone guardian stands, along with [Hiyasa](<../../../people/mawarans/hiyasa.md>), halfway entombed in stone. The party tries to negotiate, but fails, as the guardian does not approve of any tribute they offer, and attacks. A crucial counterspell by [Nerissa](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/nerissa.md>) puts the party in a good position to start the battle, but the tides turn when the stone guardian is able to turn a large section of the floor to mud, knock [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>) unconscious, and toss him in. However, before the guardian can turn the mud back to stone, entombing [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>) forever, [Ryu](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>) in anger critically hits the guardian, killing him. As the mud slowly solidifies again, [Hiyasa](<../../../people/mawarans/hiyasa.md>) is saved by the inspiring words of [Nerissa](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/nerissa.md>), while [Trok](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>) barely manages to pull himself to safety. With the guardian destroyed, the party recovers loot from several jars placed on the main altar of the tomb.

### 28 October 1747
The party returns to town. Here, they divide the spoils, leaving a loose sheaf of scrolls in an unknown language for [Wazir](<../../../people/pcs/mawar-confederacy/wazir.md>) to decipher. [Hiyasa](<../../../people/mawarans/hiyasa.md>) also gives them a copy of the treasure map, in thanks for saving her.

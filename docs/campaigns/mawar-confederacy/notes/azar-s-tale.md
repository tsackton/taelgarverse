Some time later, he learned of Airion. He doesn't remember exactly how, or from who. But he took the knife and went into the mountains, hoping to learn more and maybe find answers. The time in the mountains is mostly a blank; he remembers the dreams more clearly than his waking moments, and the strength of Gazankoa flowing through him, saving him many times. 

A few months ago, he emerged in Medin, carrying with him several items of Airion's treasure. Three books of notes and lore; a ring that could bind a genie and command a service of it; and a brass bowl that could be used to control water and water elementals, somehow. He poured over the notes and books, and learned of Yi'weti, a substance Airion claimed was sentient, living water. Realizing that this could make the resurrection ritual work, he sought more information, but kept coming to dead ends, until eventually he screwed up his resolve to try the ring. It worked better than he could have hoped. With a need for speed and secrecy, he asked Gazankoa for aid, and was promised a boat that would be hard to see and could pass through dangers on the water with ease. He won't speak of the sacrifices he made to Gazankoa to get the boat, but says that it is tainted with blood and should be destroyed.

In Hamri, he received the water from the genie and set to work, capturing six gatza addicts in the Drowned Flats. Two died in the process of exsanguination and water replacement, but three he made into servants, but still not his wife (one remained tied up in his lair). At this point he kept dreaming of killing "a better class of people", he says, finding a way to kidnap the healthy and well-to-do, as Gazankoa kept hinting this was what was missing. But the words of his wife not to harm the "real people of their village" stayed with him and he wasn't sure what to do. So he decided he needed to silence the dreams and think. At this point, the remaining sentient ocean was stolen, and he despaired, fleeing to mourn and fell deep into gatza dreams, emerging only to get the lead box he hoped would silence the knife, when he was captured.

Although it takes some time, Wazir eventually deciphers the coded text, which appears to be some kind of journal of experiments performed, an attempt at some kind of ritual. The full text is reproduced below. 

1. 
Nadine told me today that she was not alone, that there was someone with her who could help, if I spoke with him. Gazankoa, his name was. He was hard to understand but after I pledged myself to him I could see everything so clearly, and I could feel the power flowing in my veins. The ocean is the key. If I can just find the right magic, I can rescue her, I am sure. It will not be easy, but I will keep this record of my studies. I will sleep well tonight for the first time since I can remember.  

2. 
My first failure today. Nadine comforted me, spoke gently to me, told me she could wait, that I would get it right. I used the water along the route she had journeyed, and Gazankoa gave me the power to transform it as he said he would. But the poor soul I infused, lost in his own mind, endlessly talking to his dead daughter, could not speak and there was no spark of life in him. Just water pouring from his mouth and eyes as he choked to death. I had to burn the body. He will not be missed, no one cares for the gatza-addled here.

3. 
Three more failures. I must be careful. There is something I am missing, some key ingredient or component of the ritual that makes these poor souls choke and die. Nadine assures me that she can still be rescued, but I must not get caught. The power of Gazankoa swells in me and I do not think the weaklings of this village could catch me if they tried, but Nadine tells me our sons need me, she needs me, and I cannot draw attention to myself. The gatza-addled are one thing, they will not suffer, but Nadine tells me I cannot kill the real people of our home.

4.
I have decided to flee. Some are suspicious of me, it seems. But more importantly, I have found a clue. A name, really. Airion the Mistspeaker, apparently a powerful wizard from before the Great War, an expert in the elements, the magic of the planes, and the great genies of the air, water, earth and fire. The Chardonian scout must have thought me a fool to tell me about Airion, even more so to brag that the clueless Mawar had no idea what treasures lurked in the hidden caves at the source of the [Sulqat](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/rivers/sulqat.md>). The sharks will enjoy his body and Gazankoa may take his soul for all I care. 

5. 
*this entry is particularly shaky and hard to read, and the end is smeared and indecipherable*
Nadine has been quiet for so long. I hope she is okay, I pray that she is still with our boys and they are surviving together. I have been deep in the wilderness searching for the source of the [Sulqat](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/rivers/sulqat.md>) for so long, so far from the ocean, so far from civilization. I did not realize how lonely the adventuring life would be, with only the mad dreams of Gazankoa for company. Why can Nadine not speak to me here? I must return soon, I …..

6. 
Nadine is back! I have reached the western coast of the Mawakel peninsula, I am staying in the small town of Medin. Many pass through here, and there is even a small Chardonian trade mission. It is a good place for me. Just north is a salt lizardfolk town so access to gatza, and the gatza-addled, is easy, and there is enough coming and going that they are rarely missed. But the secrets of Airion’s research do not seem to have helped, for I have had four more failures. Nadine assures me she was safe while I was gone, and the boys are with her. But I must hurry. 

7.
I think the secret is what Airion calls the Yi’weti.

8.
Gazankoa fills my dreams again with the turbulent, never-ending sea all around me. Nadine is scared. I must use Airion’s treasure. I don’t have much time left, I don’t think.

9.
Nimessa will fulfill my demands; she has little choice but to comply, after all. I can see why Airion studied these creatures and bound one to his ring! Her magic is very strong and were she not bound to complete this service for me I am afraid she would kill me. But she will go west and get Yi’weti for me, and bind a creature from her home to protect it. But she says I must go to Hamri, something about the distance between the planes. I did not understand and do not care. Hamri is a short journey. I am ashamed to say I have had to make a sacrifice to Gazankoa to guarantee my transportation, but time is short and I must arrive undetected.

10.
Nimessa is very angry with me, cursing me as she faded from this world, but I reminded her she cannot harm me until a thousand and one days have passed. By them I will have rescued Nadine and my boys and we can flee somewhere far, far, far away from the ocean.

11. 
Success! The Yi’weti has worked! It took three tries, but the poor babbling creature lives, although she speaks gibberish most of the time and water seems to pour from her at every moment. It is not Nadine, this I know, but now I just need to refine the ritual. At least the failures will obey me. I have enough Yi’weti for at least five more attempts, and probably more, as long as that thing Nimessa summoned keeps it safe. Soon I will have my dear Nadine and our boys back, I can feel it. I am so close.

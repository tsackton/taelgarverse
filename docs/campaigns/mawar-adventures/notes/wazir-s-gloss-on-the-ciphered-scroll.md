{title: Wazir's Gloss on the Ciphered Scroll}
---
Trok / Ryu,

Although we were victorious in the cave beneath the cliffs, I fear the danger has not yet passed. I have managed to decipher the scroll we found there, and it tells a chilling tale. I am attaching a copy I have made, so you can come prepared.

The Yi'wetiÂ this scroll speaks of, although I have not heard the name, it is in Aquan, a language I know. It means "from the living (or alive) ocean". I fear the author of this scroll has gone mad with gatza and believes he has found a way to raise the dead. And I am almost certain the Nimessa mentioned in this scroll is some creature from the depths of the sea, or perhaps even farther -- a plane of elemental water, even. And the headwaters of the Sulqat, I have been there. The less I say in a letter the better, but we will discuss tonight. It is not a safe or happy place.

Please, if you can, let us meet at the Leviathan this evening, two hours after the evening tide. Come quietly, if you can.  

Yours in friendship,

Wazir Sayani

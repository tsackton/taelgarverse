The Addermarch Campaign tells the story of [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>), [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>), and [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>), for now known as the [Addermarch Mercenaries](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/addermarch-mercenaries.md>), three adventurers blown together by chance. They met on the road to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), a village in [Addermarch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>), all seeking to join the service of [Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>), a mysterious alchemist and recluse. 

Their story begins with the eventful journey to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), uncovering the mystery of [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>), told in:
- [Addermarch - Session 1](<./addermarch-session-1.md>)

title: Addermarch Campaign
---

The Addermarch Campaign tells the story of [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>), [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>), and [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>), for now known as the [Addermarch Mercenaries](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/addermarch-mercenaries.md>), three adventurers blown together by chance. They met on the road to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), a village in [Addermarch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>), all seeking to join the service of [Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>), a mysterious alchemist and recluse. 

The game begins in the 2nd year of the reign of [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), recorded as the year 1715 after the founding of Drankor (1715 DR) by scholars, at a time of uncertainty in the [Western Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/western-green-sea.md>). Less than two years ago, Queen [Cece I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) and [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), ally to [Addermarch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>), and victor against the hobgoblins in the [Third Hobgoblin War](<../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>), died. With her, seemingly, 65 years of peace and prosperity also died, for since [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) took the throne, [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) has been beset by troubles. 

In [Addermarch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>), thought, the worries of distant kings and queens often seem remote, and it is the late snows and cold spring that are on the minds of  farmers, hoping for a good apple crop this year.

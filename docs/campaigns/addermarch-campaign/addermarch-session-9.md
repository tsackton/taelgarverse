## Narrative

### Day 19 (Thursday)

We begin as the party leaves the small cavern with the dead oozes and the uligium, and heads to the southeast, where they emerge into a large cavern, with an unstable floor and rubble against the far wall, as if from an earlier collapse. Yvan approaches curiously, as the floor collapses under him, revealing a cavern below filled with glowing mushrooms and a sign in a strange language. Yvan manages to avoid falling in, and the party regroups while the pseudodragon scouts. 

Flying into the mushroom cavern, the pseudodragon finds what looks like a farm. Mushrooms are planted in regular rows, and labeled with signs. Continuing towards the exit, a sudden shrieking starts, from one of the mushrooms. Moving past, the pseudodragon keeps exploring, finding a passage, at the end of which a river can be seen, and another passage that leads to a flowstone with dripping water into a pool. 

After returning to the party, the group continues exploring, shortly finding themselves at the top of the flowstone, looking down. While Yvan and Drou slide down, [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) does a perfect dive into the pool. The party continues to the west, entering another large oblong cavern. [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>), searching for anything interesting, finds a crawlspace near the ceiling with a tunnel. The pseudodragon scouts, and briefly succumbs to poison gas in a small chamber at the end of the crawlspace tunnel, but notes that there is uligium there. The party struggles to climb the cave walls, with [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) and [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) both falling, but [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) is able to reach the top and anchors a rope, which provides a platform which Drou can use to summon an *Unseen Servant* to fetch the uligium. 

Leaving the main cavern, the party gets slightly lost due to Yvan's poor attempt at a map. They find themselves in a cavern, from which a booming voice yells, asking who dares disturb the home of the Master of Light and Shadow! The voice argues briefly, and the party talks, eventually convincing the owner of the voice, a [kobold](<../../species/unusual-species/kobolds.md>) named Zibzig Sparkscale who describes himself as a brilliant inventor working to create novel magic, to reveal himself. 

From Zibzig, the party learns that there is a predator -- a giant cave fisher, a crab-like creature -- hanging over the river, preventing Zibzig from traveling the underground river in his boat. The party agrees to destroy the predator for Zibzig. A fight ensues, but the party is able to relatively easily dodge the dangling snare of the cave fisher, and dispatches it quickly. We end as the battle wraps up and the party spends the night with Zibzig in his cozy two-room furnished lair.

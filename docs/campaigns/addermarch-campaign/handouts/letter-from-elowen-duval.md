Dear Fazoth, Drou, and Yvan,

Thank you for speaking with me yesterday. Overnight, I have received more news from the Sir Gareth and his company of soldiers. I did not realize you had managed to defeat such a large number of zombies! Sir Gareth says he found the watch deserted, with only the ghost and the dead bodies of 10 defeated undead. He sends his thanks to you for making the road safe again for travelers. I join him in this, and in appreciation I have sent a small purse to Bertrand to fund your stay in town for the next week.

I am aware that you are intending on joining Caradoc's service. However, I hope that if your duties allow, you will join me at the manor for dinner next Friday night. I would get to know you better, as there are at times small tasks that might be suitable for such a group as yourself to undertake, with suitable compensation.

I have also heard that one of your number is an accomplished musician, and if she would be willing, I would dearly love to hear her play at dinner.

In dedication to the service of Earl William Valois and the holy protection of the Sibyl,  
Your servant,  
Lady Elowen Duvall

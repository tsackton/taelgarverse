## Narrative
### Day 18 (Wednesday, cont)
We begin as the party departs Samatha of Fontwick's farmhouse outside the small village of Fontwick, heading in the hills. By mid-afternoon, the party has left behind the fields and pastures, and is struggling through a rocky, hilly forest. Following a narrow track through dense woods, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) is surprised by a nearly-invisible patch of sticky webs strung across the trail, but manages to dodge out of the way and avoid being entangled. As [Yvan Greenrabbit](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) attempts to disintegrate the web with acid, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) notes a large, shadowy bulk in the denser trees to the left, while [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) tramples through the brambles on the right. 

Unexpectedly, a swarm of tiny spiders crawl over [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) from the brush, stinging him, but are burned off by [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>)'s fiery burst and [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)'s flaming rebuke. As the large spider moves to investigate, [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) burns the webs with magical flame and the party flees. 

That evening, the party makes camp in a clearing, a few miles by [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>)'s reckoning from the cave they are seeking (possibly marked on the map [recovered from a dwarven explorer](<./addermarch-session-3.md>) in the cockatrice caves). During [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>)'s watch, a few hours after sunset, a strange man, wearing patched clothes with a bushy, wild beard, wanders into camp. He seems annoyed the party is camped in "his hills", but after some time is calmed by [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) and [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>), and tells them about the "big man, double-big man" who lives in the cave entrance with his pet wolf, and particularly likes to eat halflings. He introduces himself as Norman the Wanderer, and agrees to lead the party to cave after breakfast.

### Day 19 (Thursday)
in the morning, Norman the Wanderer leads the party to the cave, and then scurries off. There is, indeed, a very big man, about 10 feet tall, bulky and poorly dressed, making the cave his home. This morning, he is cutting up a partially rotten cow, throwing pieces into a large iron cookpot and occasionally tossing something to his wolf. After a bit of investigation, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) uses her druidcraft magic to make the sound and smell of a goat bleating in the woods, which succeeds in luring the big man out to investigate. 

While he is not paying attention, [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) casts Sleep on the wolf. As it falls unconscious, and then asleep, the party runs to the back of the cave, where there is a pit that drops into the darkness. The big man returns as [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) is hammering a spike into the floor to anchor a rope, and the party quickly scrambles into the hole. 

About 70 feet down, there is a ledge, and the party takes a minute to recuperate, while [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)'s pseudodragon flies up to the top of the pit, where the big man is leering into the hole and shouting about his food getting away. The pseudodragon cuts the rope just below the spike, and the party anchors it again, and descends the final 100 or so feet to the bottom of the cave. 

We end, late morning, in the darkness of the cave as the party prepares to explore.

The party defeats a pack of worgs and learns about the fey. 

## Timeline

- **May 17, 1715 DR, night:** Returning with Rowena, the party reaches **Haldrenn** just as a worg pack attacks, and defeats the worgs. After the battle, the party speaks with villagers and learns of the missing Duncan, a boastful youth who left seeking fey treasure.     
- **May 18, 1715 DR, morning:** Tracking the worg trail east across the Highmoor, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) loses it on a rocky ridge. [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s fey-lantern flares, revealing a nervous sprite who reports turmoil in Morlaith’s realm and seeks passage north to **[Lord Serenveil](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-serenveil.md>)**’s domain. After parleying with the sprite, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) picks up fresh wolf prints heading northeast along the ridge.

## Narrative
### Monday, May 17th, 2 Robert I

[Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>), [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>), and [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) race back to Haldrenn, having rescued Rowena from swarms of bees maddened by a strange fey song, and arrive as a pack of worgs descends on the village. [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) destroys the leader of the pack with a perfectly placed _Chromatic Orb_, while [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) summons a _Cloud of Daggers_ and [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) creates a wave of thundering energy with _Shatter_ that destroys many of the smaller wolves in the pack; the villages stand uneasily in a line. As the battle progresses, the worgs free the fey-maddened bull and a cow, who charge the villagers, tossing one aside, badly wounded. However, moving quickly, the party is able to destroy the rest of the worgs and fey beasts, and move quickly to heal the wounded villager. 

After the battle, the children come out from the temple where they had been hiding, safe, while several village elders build a bonfire to help clean up the aftermath. The party gathers around the bonfire with Helen of Haldrenn, Manfred (Rowena's father), and Karl. While Helen of Haldrenn tries to keep the peace, Manfred angrily tells the story of Duncan, a boastful young man from the village. A few months ago he claimed he had found a way to recover a great treasure from the fey, set off to the east promising he would return with riches, and was never heard from again. Many now think he angered the Briarheart. Helen tells of the uneasy bargain between the people of Haldrenn -- and many of the other small villages of the Highmoor -- and Morlaith, who they call the Briarheart, to keep the fey passages closed to worse things that might come through, like the minions of the [Gloomshaper](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-umbraeth.md>). To Helen, at least, the worgs that attacked were malicious in a way that Morlaith is not, and she believed they were not minions of the Briarheart but instead some vicious creature of the [Gloomshaper](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-umbraeth.md>) allowed to pass.

The conservation winds down late, with the party resolved to search for any sign of Duncan. 

### Tuesday, May 18th, 2 Robert I

In the morning, the party sets out following the tracks of the worgs, with [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) leading the search. The tracks lead east over the rolling downs of the Highmoor. For an hour or two, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) is able to follow the tracks, but as the sun rises to midmorning she loses the tracks on a rocky ridge a few hour's walk east of Haldrenn. 

As the party stops to ponder their next steps, [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)'s fey lantern lights up, signaling the presence of a fey creature. Searching uncovers nothing, but after a brief and persuasive conversation a tiny flying sprite reveals themselves. While they do not give their name, they say they are trying to get back to [Lord Serenveil](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-serenveil.md>)'s domain, to the north, and speak of disturbances in Morlaith's realm that are making it a dangerous place to be, for some reason. The sprite also warns the party about the Hollow Man, coming this night to punish Haldrenn. 

The session ends as [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>), after a stop and some conversation, searches for the trail again and finds wolf prints leading northeast along the ridge.

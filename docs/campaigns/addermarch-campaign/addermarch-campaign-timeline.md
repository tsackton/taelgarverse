# Timeline of the Addermarch Campaign

- **Apr 25, 1715 DR, dawn:** In **[Valcroix](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/valcroix.md>)**, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>), [Fazoth de Brune](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>), and [Yvan Greenrabbit](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) agree to escort merchant [Oona Stonebridge](<../../people/halflings/oona-stonebridge.md>) to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>); the small caravan sets out under clear skies along the road.
- **Apr 25, 1715 DR:** Travel is slow but peaceful through orchards, fields, and hamlets as the company heads north-west toward the forested hills.
- **Apr 26, 1715 DR:** An uneventful march sees the road leave the river valley and begin climbing into the shadowed reaches of the [Torvaine Forest](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-forest.md>).
- **Apr 27, 1715 DR, morning:** The party clears a wind-fallen tree from the road; a sunning adder spooks the horses, throwing [Oona](<../../people/halflings/oona-stonebridge.md>), but she is quickly healed and the team presses on.
- **Apr 27, 1715 DR, late afternoon:** Only a few miles from [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>) the caravan is ambushed by two burrowing mohlers; the creatures are slain, yet their presence so near the garrison alarms the travelers, who camp for the night.
- **Apr 28, 1715 DR, morning:** On the final approach the group discovers a peddler’s corpse drained of blood and apparently fleeing the fort.
- **Apr 28, 1715 DR, early afternoon:** Arriving at [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>) they find the portcullis locked and silent, encounter a ghostly knight who warns of death, and fight a mess-hall full of zombies. A key taken from the undead opens the gathering hall; more zombies in the barracks are destroyed, loot is gathered, and in Marshal [Hildo Brask](<../../people/addermarians/hildo-brask.md>)’s quarters the party uncovers a bloody trail and the marshal’s troubling letter.
- **Apr 28, 1715 DR, early afternoon:** Crossing the hoarding to the eastern tower, the party fends off stirges lurking in the rafters, then follows a blood trail downstairs and ransacks an armory whose locked chest resists them. In the smithy the heroes slay the undead smith **Bartoz**, discover how the twin winches work, and coordinate across the bridge to raise [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>)’s main gates.
- **Apr 28, 1715 DR, late afternoon:** Venturing to the commander’s quarters they find Marshal **[Hildo Brask](<../../people/addermarians/hildo-brask.md>)**’s corpse, confront the wrathful ghost of Sir **[Einrik Arpaad](<../../people/addermarians/einrik-arpaad.md>)**, seize a cursed [Serpentine Dagger](<../../things/magic-items/serpentine-dagger.md>), and retreat as debris hurls after them.
- **Apr 28, 1715 DR, evening:** After recovering Brask’s body and a treasure chest, the group quits [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>) and camps beside the road with **[Oona Stonebridge](<../../people/halflings/oona-stonebridge.md>)** and her wagon.
- **Apr 29, 1715 DR:** The caravan travels without incident along the uneven forest road through the [Torvaine Forest](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-forest.md>).
- **Apr 30, 1715 DR, morning:** South of [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) the party meets Sir **Gareth Howell** and a troop sent by Lady **Elowen Duval** to investigate the silence at the watch; [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s account of the curse persuades Gareth to let the dagger remain in his care.
- **Apr 30, 1715 DR, evening:** The companions reach **[Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>)** and secure lodging.
- **May 01, 1715 DR:** Fare-welling Oona, they report to Lady Duval, claim a bounty for recovered arms, and are asked to consult priest **[Owen Tavish](<../../people/addermarians/owen-tavish.md>)** of **[The Sibyl](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-sibyl.md>)** regarding the dagger; Duval also relates a rider’s full tale of the tomb-found blade and the massacre at [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>).
- **May 02, 1715 DR:** The party receives letters from priest **[Owen Tavish](<../../people/addermarians/owen-tavish.md>)** and Lady **Elowen Duval**. [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) visits the Sunday market and sells ancient coins recovered from [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>). Alchemist **[Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>)** arrives and hires them to slay a cockatrice and return with its gizzard as proof.
- **May 03, 1715 DR, morning:** The companions leave [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), cross open farmland and the rocky hills of the Stonewolds; near the **Kilrath Standing Stones** they locate the cockatrice cave.
- **May 03, 1715 DR, midday:** Inside they discover a petrified dwarf, a strange map, and fend off a shadow-animated skeleton.In the main cavern they defeat an adult cockatrice and its hatchlings amid a dormant fey gate and a lifelike statue of a shepherd boy. A furious naiad binds [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) and [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) until they purge red algae tainting her pool; treasure—including Duval family jewels and an odd golden symbol of **[The Sibyl](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-sibyl.md>)**—is recovered and the fey gate is destroyed.
- **May 03, 1715 DR, evening:** Laden with gizzard, eggs, and loot, the party camps on the road back toward [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>).
- **May 04, 1715 DR, morning:** A detour to **[Brantor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/brantor.md>)** lets them deliver the gizzard to [Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>).
- **May 04, 1715 DR, evening:** Returning to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) they present the recovered jewels to Lady Duval, claim the long-standing bounty on the thief who stole them, and settle again at The Traveler’s Rest.
- **May 05, 1715 DR:** In [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), the party sells the vial of magical weapon-oil looted from [Torvaine Watch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/torvaine-watch.md>) and purchases extra healing potions at the bustling market square.
- **May 06, 1715 DR, morning:** At the Temple of the Sibyl in [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), the party confers with [Owen Tavish](<../../people/addermarians/owen-tavish.md>) about the [Serpentine Dagger](<../../things/magic-items/serpentine-dagger.md>), and sell him an ancient Sibylline holy symbol.
- **May 06, 1715 DR, afternoon:** At [Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>)’s cottage near [Brantor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/brantor.md>), the party commissions a dose of [Trueflame](<../../things/materials/trueflame.md>) to aid in destroying the [Serpentine Dagger](<../../things/magic-items/serpentine-dagger.md>), and accepts a contract to recover a stolen “glowing poison” recipe from local goblins.
- **May 07, 1715 DR, evening:** Over dinner in Lady **Elowen Duval’s** hall—complete with [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>)’s performance, [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>)’s live painting, and [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s fireworks—they learn from Captain **Gareth Howell** of a goblin hideout and his missing squire; the party vows to investigate.
- **May 08, 1715 DR, morning:** Trekking north into the hills they reach a cave entrance, trigger a collapsing-floor trap, and rout the first wave of goblin sentries with chromatic orbs, invisibility, and misty step.
- **May 08, 1715 DR, afternoon:** Following tracks to a hidden trapdoor they descend, dodge another pit alarm, burst into the goblin living-quarters, and—after a brutal melee of cloud-of-daggers, fist-flurries, and arcane blasts—slay the bandits and seize the room.
- **May 08, 1715 DR, late afternoon:** Masquerading as a goblin, [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) infiltrates the guardroom, locates captive squire **Colette du Bois**, and with [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) and [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) swiftly cuts down the drunken jailers before freeing her. After bribing the lair’s giant skittering spiders with pantry beef, the party slips through a secret door, battles the goblin queen and her minions in the throne room, and secures both treasure and the stolen **glowing-poison recipe**.
- **May 08, 1715 DR, evening:** The party returns to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>), stopping in **[Brantor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/brantor.md>)** to exchange the recipe (plus gold) for [Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>)’s completed vial of **[Trueflame](<../../things/materials/trueflame.md>)**.
- **May 09, 1715 DR, morning:** In the Temple of the Sibyl, [Owen Tavish](<../../people/addermarians/owen-tavish.md>) oversees as the heroes use [Trueflame](<../../things/materials/trueflame.md>) to finally destroy the cursed **[Serpentine Dagger](<../../things/magic-items/serpentine-dagger.md>)**.
- **May 09, 1715 DR, afternoon:** A quiet market day in [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) ends with alchemist **[Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>)** proposing a new quest: descend a nearby deep-cave network and retrieve the rare living mineral Uligium
- **May 10, 1715 DR:** [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>), [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>), and [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) purchase ropes, torches, and climbing gear while gathering cave lore from Colette du Bois and other locals to pinpoint the closest subterranean system.
- **May 11, 1715 DR:** The party departs [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) early, heading west toward **Fontwick**. On the road, they meet distraught dairy farmers whose cattle were slain by a huge burrowing insect; Samatha of Fontwick guides the heroes back to her farm while her husband rides to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) for Lady **Elowen Duval**’s aid. The party settles in to watch for the night.
- **May 12, 1715 DR, just after midnight:** An **ankheg** erupts from the pasture; simultaneous witch-bolt strikes from [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) and [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>), plus [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>)’s support, subdue the monster before serious harm is done.
- **May 12, 1715 DR, dawn:** Samatha receives a generous purse from [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) to replace her herd and provisions the adventurers with bread, cheese, and apples as they continue their journey toward the rumored deep caverns.
- **May 12, 1715 DR:** The party leaves Fontwick, heading northwest and entering the wooded hills of the western Stonewolds. While pushing through a rocky, forested trail, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) narrowly avoids a nearly invisible web trap; a swarm of tiny spiders assaults [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) but are burned away, and the party flees a looming giant spider deeper in the trees.
- **May 12, 1715 DR, late evening:** Camping a few miles from the probable location of the West Stonewolds Caves, the group meets **Norman the Wanderer**, a rag-clad hermit who warns them of a “double-big man” and wolf guarding the entrance; he agrees to guide them at dawn.
- **May 13, 1715 DR, morning:** Norman leads them to the cave and slips off; the ten-foot “big man” is busy butchering a cow for his stew. [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) lures him away with illusory goat sounds, [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s sleep spell fells the wolf, and the party rappels seventy feet into a dark pit. [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s pseudodragon severs the upper rope to foil the furious ogre, and the adventurers descend another hundred feet, landing in the lightless depths ready to explore.
- **May 13, 1715 DR, late morning:** Deep beneath the hills the party enters a vast cavern; a giant skeleton animates and is shattered by [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>)’s flurry of blows and [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s finishing eldritch blast, though the loose arm momentarily terrifies [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>). [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s pseudodragon scouts the depths and is killed by a [dragon](<../../species/unusual-species/dragons.md>) in the deeps. The heroes locate their first vein of uligium and pause for lunch.
- **May 13, 1715 DR, early afternoon**: The party survives a piercer ambush, then push into a damp chamber rich in uligium where two gray oozes attack and are killed, but not before [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) is knocked unconscious (and subsequently revived with a healing potion).
- **May 13, 1715 DR, mid-afternoon:** Leaving the ooze chamber, the party enters a rubble-strewn cavern; the floor collapses under [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>), revealing a mushroom-lit farm below. After scouting the party slides down the flowstone to a large oblong cave. A crawl-tunnel high in the wall leads to a poison-filled nook rich in **uligium**.
- **May 13, 1715 DR, late afternoon:** While wandering through twisting passages, [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>)’s mapwork proving unreliable, a booming voice claims the domain of the “Master of Light and Shadow.” Parley reveals **Zibzig Sparkscale**, a kobold inventor.
- **May 13, 1715 DR, evening:** Agreeing to help Zibzig Sparkscale defeat the monster blocking the river, the party fights a huge cave-fisher crab. Dodging its sticky filament, they slay the monster quickly. They spend the night in Zibzig’s cozy, gadget-filled two-room lair, resting for further exploration.
- **May 14, 1715 DR, morning:** Over fried-mushroom pancakes in **Zibzig Sparkscale’s** lair, the kobold inventor shares directions to an uligium cache and warns of “lurkers above the water.”
- **May 14, 1715 DR, midday:** Reaching a pool-filled cavern beyond a chasm, the party is plunged into magical darkness as four **darkmantles** drop from the ceiling; [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>)’s fiery surges, [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s lightning-guided pseudodragon, and [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>)’s tenacity shatter the creatures. Heated glass lures fresh **uligium** from the tunnel walls.
- **May 14, 1715 DR, late afternoon:** Guided back to the surface route, they pacify the ogre and wolf at the cave mouth with [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s _Calm Emotions_ and escape unharmed, bearing four vials of uligium.
- **May 14, 1715 DR, night:** The heroes trek eastward and camp in open farmland en-route to [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>).
- **May 15, 1715 DR, evening:** After a day’s march and a stop in [Brantor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/brantor.md>) to deliver their alchemical prize, the party arrives safely in **[Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>)**.
- **May 16, 1715 DR, morning:** [Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>) visits the party in [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>) with rumors of maddened livestock in Haldrenn, and asks the party to investigate.  After acquiring potions from [Caradoc](<../../people/addermarians/caradoc.md>) in [Brantor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/brantor.md>), the heroes march northeast into the Highmoor and camp in the open hills.
- **May 17, 1715 DR, late afternoon:** The party reaches Haldrenn and learns from nine-year-old Bran that six-year-old Rowena is missing and a funeral for Olay (gored by his own bull) is imminent. Bran recites a creepy “Hollow Men” rhyme said to warn of the Briarheart.
- **May 17, 1715 DR, early evening:** Questions to charcoal-burner **Karl** and priest-storyteller **Helen of Haldrenn** uncover more of the strange events. [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>)’s animal-speech reveal the cattle are tormented by a relentless song compelling violence.
- **May 17, 1715 DR, sunset:** Tracking prints and using [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s fey-lantern, the party follows Rowena’s trail east into the hills and locates her hiding in a cave filled with maddened bees. Swarms are dispersed by Cloud of Daggers, Chromatic Orb, and Dissonant Whispers; Rowena is rescued unharmed.
- **May 17, 1715 DR, night:** As the rescuers crest the last ridge toward Haldrenn the fey-lantern flares and the howls of worgs attacking the village echo across the darkened fields.
- **May 17, 1715 DR, night:** Returning with Rowena, the party reaches **Haldrenn** just as a worg pack attacks, and defeats the worgs. After the battle, the party speaks with villagers and learns of the missing Duncan, a boastful youth who left seeking fey treasure.
- **May 18, 1715 DR, morning:** Tracking the worg trail east across the Highmoor, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) loses it on a rocky ridge. [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s fey-lantern flares, revealing a nervous sprite who reports turmoil in Morlaith’s realm and seeks passage north to **[Lord Serenveil](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-serenveil.md>)**’s domain. After parleying with the sprite, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) picks up fresh wolf prints heading northeast along the ridge.

The adventurers face battles with a skeleton and gray oozes, uncovering ancient secrets and collecting uligium underground.

## Timeline

- **May 13, 1715 DR, late morning:** Deep beneath the hills the party enters a vast cavern; a giant skeleton animates and is shattered by [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>)’s flurry of blows and [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s finishing eldritch blast, though the loose arm momentarily terrifies [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>). [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)’s pseudodragon scouts the depths and is killed by a [dragon](<../../species/unusual-species/dragons.md>) in the deeps. The heroes locate their first vein of uligium and pause for lunch.
- **May 13, 1715 DR, early afternoon**: The party survives a piercer ambush, then push into a damp chamber rich in uligium where two gray oozes attack and are killed, but not before [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) is knocked unconscious (and subsequently revived with a healing potion).

## Narrative
### Thursday, May 13th, 2 Robert I
We start in late morning, in the cave far beneath the ground, where the party has come to search for uligium, an alchemical substance used for potions. The group proceeds southeast along a narrow passage, emerging in a large dark cavern, with a large skeleton in the middle. [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) investigates the bones, which animate and attack. In the ensuing battle, [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) advances with her fluid dance and hits the skeleton multiple times, doing significant damage to the brittle bones with her fists, while [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) attacks with a chromatic orb and [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) shoots a bolt of electrical energy, which misses the skeleton. [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) recovers, though, and, inspired by [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>), lands an eldritch blast to destroy the skeleton, though [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>), full of magical energy, finds himself frightened of the skeletal arm. 

Searching the area, the party finds several passageways leading from this cavern, as well as a pit that drops hundreds of feet. [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)'s pseudodragon descends to investigate the pit, finding a strange underground road at the bottom. A few miles to the west, among the ruins of a clearly ancient underground city, the head of a sapphire [dragon](<../../species/unusual-species/dragons.md>) emerges, glances curiously at the pseudodragon, and destroys it. [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) resummons the pseudodragon and then sends it the other direction, eventually finding a cave-in which seems to have killed a [dwarf](<../../species/dwarves.md>), clearly ancient from their armor and the four golden coins the pseudodragon brings back for [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>). After this exploration, the party searches another small cavern connected to the main chamber, finding uligium here, and takes a short rest to have a midday meal and recover. 

After lunch, the party follows the southeast exit from the main cavern. Reaching another pit -- shallower this time -- they cross, with [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) demonstrating his misty step. On the far side, piercers drop from the ceiling. While [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) is hit, [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>) manages to dodge, and [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) trips at just the right time leaving the piercer to land helplessly on the ground behind him. Continuing to explore, the party finds another small passage leading to a chamber with wet rocks and more uligium. 

The wet rocks turn out to be gray oozes. [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>) fires a chromatic orb, which bounces from ooze to ooze but the cold does not seem to damage them very much. However, the magic of the spell does make the oozes vulnerable to piercing damage, prompting [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) to move in with her daggers, making several devastating attacks, as the daggers slowly corrode in the acid of the oozes. [Fazoth](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/fazoth-de-brune.md>)'s pseudodragon contributes with its claws. [Drou](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/drou.md>) falls victim to the acid attacks, but is revived by [Yvan](<../../people/pcs/addermarch/yvan-greenrabbit.md>)'s potion, and manage to finish off the oozes with her daggers nearly disintegrated. We end the session as the battle concludes.

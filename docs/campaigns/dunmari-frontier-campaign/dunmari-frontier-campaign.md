title: Dunmari Frontier Campaign
---

The Dunmari Frontier Campaign tells the story of the adventures of [Delwath](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), [Kenzo](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), [Seeker](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), and [Wellby](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), along with their frequent companion [Riswynn](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), sometimes known as the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>). 

The events begin in the 191st year of the Nayan Dynasty in Dunmar, or DR 1748 as the Chardonians reckon, in the village of [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) in [Eastern Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>). Since their humble beginnings fighting gnolls, the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) has grown to a powerful force.

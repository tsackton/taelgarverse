A small metal top, of Drankorian origin, that spins continuously while it is being observed. Radiates divination magic. Probably designed not just as a toy, but as a way to detect scrying. 


Originally found in [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)â€™s hut by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>). Carried by [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) until it was [taken](<../session-notes/session-44-dufr.md>) by [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) during a tense midnight parley. Eventually recovered by the party upon [Kadmos' defeat](<../session-notes/session-79-dufr.md>).

# Jade Piece of Rai's Hand
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **Unique Magical Gemstone**  

Five fragments of jade, each originally a piece of [Rai](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>)'s hand.
## History

When the [Heroes of the Great War](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/heroes-of-the-great-war.md>) killed [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>), [Rai](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>) channeled so much raw magical energy that it completed the transformation of his body, turning him into a living statue of jade. In this moment, he was warned by the elf [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>) about [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) and the dangers of him breaking free of his prison in [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), as [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s imprisonment of Apollyon failed in the moment of Cha'mutte's death. 

Rai, acting as quickly as he could, teleported to Drankor, still weak from battle. Here, he did something to contain Apollyon. Arheste [believed](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md#arhestes-story>), and [Kenzo's dreams](<../dreams-and-visions/first-dream-of-rai.md>) also suggest, that he may have simply grasped Apollyon's phylactery in his hand, keeping Apollyon weak as without the ability to feed souls to his phylactery, he could not gain power and escape, even without Cha'mutte's power holding him imprisoned. 

For many years, this was the state of things. 

Until apparently Rai left Drankor, on a mission with the monks of the [Order of the Awakened Soul](<../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/order-of-the-awakened-soul.md>). Why, and how, is still not clear. But what is clear is that this [mission was a disaster](<../../../events/1700s/1718/awakened-soul-disaster.md>). In [visions](<../mirror-visions/kenzo-s-jade-vision.md>) and [dreams](<../dreams-and-visions/second-dream-of-rai.md>), it is clear that as part of this mission, [Rai](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>) tried to close a portal, or something, in order to heal the [Plaguelands](<../../../gazetteer/upper-istaros/plaguelands.md>), but it went wrong, and the effort shattered his hand, creating the five pieces of jade that are now scattered across the land, and releasing Apollyon from his long imprisonment. 
## Whereabouts

One piece fell in the Dunmari desert, and was given to [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) by his parents before they died. Kenzo saw [a vision of this piece in Eudomes' Mirror](<../mirror-visions/kenzo-s-jade-vision.md>).

One piece fell in the [Elderwood](<../../../gazetteer/central-highlands/elderwood.md>), was found by the Godcaller [Jordo](<../../../people/deno-qai/jordo.md>), became part of the protection of the Te'kula, and was eventually gifted to [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) by [Alayah](<../../../people/deno-qai/alayah.md>), [Jordo](<../../../people/deno-qai/jordo.md>)'s successor, after [the Dunmar Fellowship killed the green dragon Grimbaskal](<../session-notes/session-52-dufr.md>) that had threatened the Te'kula. 

One piece was [seen](<../dreams-and-visions/second-dream-of-rai.md>) to fall into a crevasse in an icy glacier. Later, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) learned from the Deno'qai druid [Safri](<../../../people/deno-qai/safri.md>) that this piece was found by a man named [Radomir](<../../../people/other-humans/radomir.md>) from a strange land to the east known as [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk/ursk.md>), who had fled his homeland looking for a way to destroy it, but apparently returned, unsuccessful. Later [scrying revealed](<../scrying-and-spying/scrying-delwath-nov-15.md#radomir>) that apparently this piece was later taken a mysterious group known as the [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>), who [may](<../session-notes/interlude-tollen-downtime.md#questions>) still have it. It was recovered by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) after they [defeated](<../session-notes/session-97-dufr.md>) [Rhodar von Glauer](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/rhodar-von-glauer.md>) and gained the alliance of the [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>)

One piece was [seen](<../dreams-and-visions/second-dream-of-rai.md>) to sink beneath the ocean. The only clue to its resting place comes from [Thomas Hawke](<../../../people/tollenders/thomas-hawke.md>), who [told the story](<../session-notes/session-82-dufr.md>) of a magical undersea garden of jade where merfolk grow names, which was the inspiration for his play, [Luminastra's Gift](<../../../things/books/luminastra-s-gift.md>). The jade garden, supposedly, was located 100 miles off the coast of the [Apporia](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>). In [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), the song [Ballad of the Jade Garden](<../../../primary-sources/songs/ballad-of-the-jade-garden.md>), sung by [Isabetta](<../../../people/chardonians/isabetta.md>), seemed to indicate it was off the coast of Tamaro Bay, on the west side of the [Apporian Peninsula](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>). Eventually, this fragment was revealed to be located in the [Elemental Plane of Water](<../../../cosmology/energy-realms/elemental-plane-of-water.md>), in the possession of the warlock Buruli, used to open a portal to the material world. Recovered after defeating Buruli. 

One piece was [seen](<../dreams-and-visions/second-dream-of-rai.md>) to fall into a dense, lush rainforest. No further clues to its location have been recovered. 
## Other Clues

# The Dunmari Map of Pandemonium Ruins
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **Uncommon [Dunmari](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) Magical Map**  

A map of the ruins of the Pandemonium fort, north of [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) created by the Dunmari during [Exile of Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../../events/1600s/exile-of-fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>). Contains notes on the secret paths to avoid the effects of [Pandemonium](<../../../cosmology/spiritual-realms/pandemonium.md>) while approaching.

Found in the [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) [Archives](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>) by [Govir](<../../../people/dunmari/govir.md>), which led to his kidnapping and infection with lycanthropy. Recovered by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), and kept for safekeeping.

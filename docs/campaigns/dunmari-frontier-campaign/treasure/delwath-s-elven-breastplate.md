# Delwath's Elven Breastplate
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Elven](<../../../species/elves.md>) Armor**  

[Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s old battle armor from his time as a quartermaster in the elven armies during the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). Originally worn by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) when he vanished into Cha'mutte's shadow realm, and was trapped. In the shadow realm, it was transformed, infused with the magic of the shadow plane, embedded in a fragment of [Inkaye](<../../../things/materials/inkaye.md>), a strange metal that can absorb extraplanar energy. 

When [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) was found, wandering in the desert by [Pava](<../../../people/dunmari/pava.md>) and [Avaras](<../../../people/dunmari/avaras.md>), they removed his armor, billowing shadows, to tend to him. He later fled their house, unaware, leaving his armor behind. When [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), now with the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), [met Pava and Avaras again](<../session-notes/session-20-dufr.md>), they returned the now-magical armor to him. 

[Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) wore his old armor for some time; later, Delwath [leaves the amor](<../session-notes/session-82-dufr.md>) with [Umli](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/umli.md>), who removes the [Inkaye](<../../../things/materials/inkaye.md>) fragment and purifies it, so it can take a new enchantment, returning the now non-magical armor to [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>). The [Inkaye](<../../../things/materials/inkaye.md>) is later used by [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) to [construct the planar prism](<../session-notes/session-87-dufr.md>) at the [Elemental Forge](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/cymea/elemental-forge.md>).

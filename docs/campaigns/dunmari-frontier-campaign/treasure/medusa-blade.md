   Destroyed November 20th, 1748

This longsword, of unknown make, is decorated with reptilian motifs, and radiates transmutation magic. 

It was taken from [Agata's Lair](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/agata-s-lair.md>) by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) and gifted to [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>). Later, the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) learned it was cursed sword, and responsible for turning [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) to stone at one point, along with his increasing paranoia in the fall of DR 1748. Grants the bearer the power to turn those they strike to stone, but will turn on the bearer as well, if given the chance. [Destroyed](<../session-notes/session-69-dufr.md>) by the [Bahrazel](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>) at [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s request, freeing [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) of its curse.

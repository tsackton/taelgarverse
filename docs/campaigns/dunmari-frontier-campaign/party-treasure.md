## Other Rewards
- The [Cloudspinner](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) named the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) always welcome in her realm, to be honored guests whenever they should travel to Amberglow. 
- A meta-resource from the weapons and armor collected from [Ra'ghemdros' Hoard](<hoards/ra-ghemdros-hoard.md>): the [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>) smithy can produce 12 weapons and armor of any kind to outfit allies, constructs, or whatever. Up to three of these can be +1 items. If an ally or simulacrum dies before being able to return a magic item to the ship, the number of magic items that can be stocked is reduced by the number lost for 2 weeks. 
- A meta-resource from speaking with [Arheste](<../../people/elves/arheste.md>): 5 times during the course of the campaign, you can get retroactive advice from Arheste on how she would have approached a challenge having to deal with Apollyon, his artifacts of power, Rai's hand, or related topics.
- The party is always welcome in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) and will always have food and shelter while they are in town.
- A letter of introduction to [Kaleha](<../../people/dunmari/kaleha.md>), high priest of the temple in Tokra, an important administrator in the civil government, from [Candrosa](<../../people/dunmari/candrosa.md>).
- A letter of introduction from [Kaleha](<../../people/dunmari/kaleha.md>), high priest of the [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) monastery, vouching for our good character.
- A writ of travel directing all godly people of [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) to provide aid and comfort to the bearers named (the party), signed and sealed by Nayan [Sura](<../../people/dunmari/sura.md>), the brother of the current Samraat and according to her the rightful ruler of [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>).
- [Hralgar](<../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) gives his blessing for the party to restore and take [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), The Star on the Wind, the ruined airship that requires a new phasing stone to fly
### Died heroically
- A 15â rope [Ladder](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/companions/ladder.md>), originally from lair of the [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>). Fought valiantly against many enemies, distinguishing themselves in combat against werewolves and others, until bravely dying in battle against [Grimbaskal](<../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>) the green dragon to allow the rest of the party to escape in [Session 51 (DuFr)](<session-notes/session-51-dufr.md>).
- The Boulder-Ladder, the hero of the [Battle for Uzgukhar](<../../events/1700s/1749/battle-for-uzgukhar.md>), who died while smashing a massive trebuchet to pieces. 
- The New Ladder, who finally got to destroy a mirror in Cloudspinner's prison, before bravely dying in battle against [Ra'ghemdros](<../../people/other-nonhumans/ra-ghemdros.md>). Slowly the ur-Ladder is beginning to feel that fighting dragons might be dangerous. 
- The Fourth Ladder, who died destroying a chalyte mirror powering a lightning tower and chalyte death ray. It is always worth the sacrifice to destroy mirrors.

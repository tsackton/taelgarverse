# Fides Lucaris Sending Stone Vision

Then the image jumps back. And you can see the same woman, now dressed in silk robes, vaguely Drankorian. She is sitting in a council, around a low table in the middle of an elaborate commander's tent. It is dark outside, but lively inside the tent. There are six people in addition to this woman, probably Drankorian, except for one, who is an elf. They seem to be having a heated discussion. Eventually, this woman stands up, and everyone quiets down as she speaks passionately, animatedly. Though you don't know what she is saying, eventually everyone begins to nod, and come to an agreement with whatever she was arguing for. The elf passes her the silvery cloak, and the sending stone (keeping its pair), and a small crystal vial, full, presumably containing universal solvent. The scene fades as everyone stands to hug the woman, shake her hand, wish her well, seeming to bid her luck on whatever adventure she was setting out on.

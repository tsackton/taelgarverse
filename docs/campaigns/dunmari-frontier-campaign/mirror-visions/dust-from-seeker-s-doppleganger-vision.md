# Dust from Seeker's Doppelgänger Vision

As you hold the dust from the destroyed doppelganger of Seeker to the mirror, the scene fades.

Quickly, you see a fist - Amil's - flying towards you in the mirror, and a crunch, and then the scene shifts again.

Drifting as a cloud high in the sky, waiting, lingering above the Plaguelands. The scene shifts.

The Seeker clone -- or what will be the Seeker clone, anyway -- is standing in front of [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), the vision and reflection showing Apollyon's back and the front of the Seeker clone, currently in a faceless, formless shape. Apollyon seems to be sitting in meditation, almost, his skeletal head bare, a pale strange echo of the [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>) floating over his head. Tendrils of smoke seem to be leaking out of the crown, and touching the clone, the unformed creature. It slowly shifts into Seeker, a reflection of Seeker anyway. The scene shifts.

You see a partially formed body lying in a coffin. Complete, but blank, featureless, misshapen. Apollyon is standing over the creature, holding a book, reading from it, glancing at the creature as he turns the pages. Chanting something, but not in a language Wellby can recognize or lip read. It seems to go on for a very long time -- the mirror shows you scenes of this, repeatedly, over months and months in a blur. The scene shifts.

You see in the mirror the walls of this chamber of Apollyon's prison, a blank wall of Drankorian marble. And Apollyon, slowly chipping away at the edge of the stone, collecting the dust that falls.

# Apollyon's Crystal Ball Vision

You hold Apollyon's crystal ball to the mirror. For a moment, all you can see is Apollyon's face staring back at you, his pinpoint eyes seemingly alive with malice as he meets your gaze. 

The image flickers, and begins to change, rapidly, showing Apollyon again and again and again, starting into the crystal ball, his eyes always starting back at you. Dozens, hundreds, thousands of flickers, it is hard to say, but it is always the same eyes, the same pinpricks of light in the darkness.

Until suddenly the scene shifts, and you see Apollyon the emperor, the Crown on his head, wearing the Cloak, wielding the Scepter. He is standing in a small, but elaborately decorated room, draped with tapestries depicting Apollyon the God-King imposing his will on a variety of groups, including a tapesty showing his defeat of the elves of [RostaurÃ«](<../../../history/drankorian-era/rostaure.md>) and the sacking of the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) and theft of the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>). 

This image holds for a moment, until Apollyon turns to look directly at you, seemingly staring through the mirror, and the scene shifts once more, to a room at the top of Apollyon's Tower on the ~Circular Island~. The Crown is on Apollyon's head, and he seems to be chanting, as energy pours from the Crown swirling in a circle, gradually pooling into the a sphere as the crystal ball takes shape...

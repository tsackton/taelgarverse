# Floating Disc Coin Vision

The scene, the reflection of the campfire fades and you see, standing in front of you, a man of indeterminate age, wearing a heavy traveling cloak, a hood covering his face, a backpack slung over his shoulder, daggers at his sides. He is flipping the coin in the air, so your perspective tumbles over and over. There is a sense of movement, like you're traveling on a road, walking at night. While it is hard to be completely sure, you suspect this is [Arcus](<../../../people/chardonians/arcus.md>).

The image shifts, and you seen, now, a different person, a much older man with a short cropped white beard, an angular face, and short white hair. He is peering down at the coin, tapping it a little bit, every now and then like examining it, seemingly studying it. He is wearing dark robes, without a hood. He is probably in his 60s, if not older, and seems to be scratching notes on something, on some piece of paper or log book that is just out of view of the mirror. He is indoors, at night, as his face is light by the light of torches or a lantern. 

As he leans forward to look at the coin again, the image shifts, and you are outside again. Someone is carrying the coin, holding it at their waist as they swing their arm back and forth. You can’t see their face or any real details of them as they walk, but from general body shape you think this is probably a human woman. She is wearing traveling clothes, muddy calf length boots, a sword at her side, a leather belt. She is walking through farmland, pasture mostly, seemingly following a river, traveling somewhere. 

The scene fades and shifts once more. Another human. This time, the coin seems to be floating behind the person, and you can only see their back. They have a shield slung over their back, chain mail armor, a helmet, a greatsword, a hint of long red hair underneath their helmet. On the shield is an insignia: a straight, tall tower, the sun behind it, six rays coming from the sun, all sitting on top of a cloud. They are walking through a cave or tunnel, somewhere underground, light coming from magic of some kind ahead of you.

# Vindristjarna Mechanics

Vindristjarna can be controlled by manipulation of [Hralgar's Phasing Stone](<treasure/hralgar-s-phasing-stone.md>), which is installed in the Control Room. This outlines the basic mechanics of controlling [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>) and the permanent magic that can be controlled via the phasing stone (the Planar Prism and the Icicle Turret). 

> [!info]+ Attunement
>In order to use any of the magic of Vindristjarna, one must be attuned to the phasing stone. Unlike the normal rules for attunement, your attunement to Vindristjarna only ends if any of the following conditions are met:
> - You die
> - You spend a Short Rest ending your attunement
>
>Up to three creatures who have spent 6 weeks training to control the phasing stone, and up to one additional creature, can be attuned to the phasing stone at the same time. If another creature attempts to attune beyond these limits, the attunement fails. 

## Flying Vindristjarna

Only one person can be actively controlling Vindristjarna at a time, regardless of the number of people attuned. To control Vindristjarna, one must physically be touching the phasing stone control mechanism, unless otherwise mentioned. There are three levels of control that are possible, depending on experience. 
### Basic Control 
After one full day of practice while attuned to the phasing stone, a person can acquire the skill to manipulate and control Vindristjarna. Flying the ship under basic control requires Concentration. It allows you to fly at speeds of up to 10 miles per hour, and also allows you to perceive from any location on the surface of the ship. Establishing basic control, maintaining velocity, and changing altitude or direction requires Concentration and contact with the phasing stone. You can maintain altitude and position without requiring Concentration, however. 
### Advanced Control
After operating Vindristjarna for at least 6 weeks, you gain the ability to control the ship in a more advanced fashion. Flying the ship under advanced control does not require Concentration, except as noted below. It allows you to fly at speeds of up to 10 miles per hour. While establishing control requires touching the phasing stone, you can maintain steady flight on a straight course indefinitely without requiring Concentration or being in the control room. Steering, delicate maneuvers such as landing, and perceiving from any location on the surface of the ship still require Concentration and contact with the phasing stone. 
### Combat Control
While flying under advanced control, you can focus to enter a heightened state of control that lasts for 10 minutes. This requires Concentration and contact with the phasing stone, but no action is required. Under this heightened state, you can fly Vindristjarna with a combat movement speed of 120 feet, you can perceive from any location on the ship, and any spells or magical abilities you use can originate from any point on the ship. Under combat control, damage cannot cause you to lose concentration on Vindristjarna. Combat control is tiring, however: the second and subsequent times you use combat control between Long Rests, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you gain one level of exhaustion when your combat control ends. 
### Losing Control
While at least one person is attuned to Vindristjarna, the ship will not crash. However, if no one is attuned to the phasing stone, the ship will begin to drift towards the ground at a speed of 10 feet per second. If the phasing stone is destroyed, or its connection to Vindristjarna severed, the ship will plummet from the sky and crash. 

## Planar Prism
The planar prism is a fine hollow sphere made of wires of [Inkaye](<../../things/materials/inkaye.md>), in which a shimmering crystal prism is mounted. This item is magically linked to the [phasing stone](<../../things/magic-items/phasing-stones.md>) on [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>): if you are attuned to the phasing stone, you are considered attuned to the rainbow prism, and vice versa. 

While attuned to and holding the planar prism, you can use a Magic action to separate resonant extraplanar energy via the spectral prism, creating a bridge of rainbow light and magical energy. This bridge can connect to one of the following locations:
- Using the inherent resonance of the plane of Taelgar, you can create a bridge to a point you can see. 
- If there are extraplanar resonances present when you activate the prism, you can separate and fracture them, creating a bridge to a location on the resonant plane, determined by the local extraplanar geography. For example, if you attempted to use the Planar Prism while near the weak point between the material plane and Arborea outside Tokra, you could connect the bridge to the closest location on Arborea.
- If you have an external source of extraplanar resonance, you can use that to tune and guide the prism, creating a bridge to a general location on that plane. You can attempt to guide the creation of the bridge to be near a landmark of interest, but cannot guarantee the endpoint of the bridge will be at a particular location on the other plane. 
- You can use the magical link between the Planar Prism and Vindristjarna's phasing stone to create a bridge that leads to Vindristjarna from any point, on Taelgar or on another plane. 

Stepping on to the bridge instantly transports a willing creature to the end point of the bridge, regardless of distance. A bridge, once created, lasts for 7 days, unless you dismiss it early as a Magic Action. 
  
Once you create a bridge, you cannot create another one until 7 days have passed, unless the distance between the two ends of the bridge is less than 100 miles, in which case you can create another bridge after the next dawn.

*Note: the intention is to allow some teleportation / plane shift hijinx, but not create a mechanism to, e.g., teleport an army (by opening a bridge, flying Vindristjarna elsewhere, then having thousands of people walk across the bridge). I haven't quite figured out the right mechanical way to limit, but want to be clear it won't work for these kinds of things.*

## Icicle Turret
The icicle turret is a silver and stone turrent mounted on the front of the ship, permanently coated in frost and ice from the embedded shard of eternal ice. This item is magically linked to the [phasing stone](<../../things/magic-items/phasing-stones.md>) on [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>): if you are attuned to the phasing stone, you are considered attuned to the icicle turret, and vice versa.  

The icicle turret has four charges, and regains all expended charges each day at dawn. As a Magic Action while touching the phasing stone, you can use one charge to create one of the following effects. If effect requires a saving throw, use your spell save DC if you have one, or 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence modifier otherwise. 
- You cast the [Sleet Storm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618998-sleet-storm) spell. You and anyone else attuned to Vindristjarna ignore the effects of the spell.  
- Rain of Ice: You launch 8 sharp daggers of ice from the turret. For each dagger, choose a target you can see within 300 feet of the turret, and make a spell attack roll, doing 2d6 cold damage on a hit. 
- Icicle Shield: You encase the entire ship in a globe of solid ice. Each 10 foot segment of ice has an AC 12, 30 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage. The wall of ice crumbles if 10 segments are destroyed. Otherwise, it lasts for 1 hour.

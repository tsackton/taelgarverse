## Narrative

Our session begins in [Emberwine](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/emberwine.md>) as the party follows [Auntie Mulberry](<../../../people/fey/auntie-mulberry.md>)'s enchanting flute melody through [Emberwine](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/emberwine.md>). [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>), speaking through [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s possessed form, reminisces about [Lord Soven](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-soven.md>) as they approach the massive pavilion bathed in golden light, and slip into the current of the dance after being greeted by a steward offering refreshments. 

![Emberwine Party 1](../../../assets/emberwine-party-1.png)

Drifting through the crowd, the party meets [Lord Soven](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-soven.md>) himself, a seven-foot-tall figure with antlered head, who invites [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) to dance while they speak. When Delwath mentions Cloudspinner's imprisonment, Lord Soven falters noticeably, shocked: "None of us ever thought the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) could return," he admits.

As the party splits up to gather information, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) meditates at the periphery, connecting with the natural world. Unlike his typical experiences, he's overwhelmed by emotions pouring from every vine and fruit—pleasure and sweetness, but with troubling undertones of overripeness, as though the land strains to maintain this celebration.

[Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), moving through the crowds looking for someone out of place, encounters [Valeris](<../../../people/fey/valeris.md>), a satyr cursed to speak only brutal truth after helping a fey woman escape an oath. Valeris reveals the deterioration of the Feywild following Cloudspinner's disappearance and mentions the [Shrouded Archive](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/shrouded-archive.md>) where all secrets are kept, as well as [Count Vashan](<../../../people/fey/count-vashan.md>), a member of Cloudspinner's court now lost in drink in [Emberwine](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/emberwine.md>). 

[Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) befriends [Ismara](<../../../people/fey/ismara.md>) of [Gleamwater](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/gleamwater.md>), a scholar of humanity eager to document the party's adventures. From [Ismara](<../../../people/fey/ismara.md>), the party hears about [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>): the [Cloud Palace](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/cloud-palace.md>) with its six towers, now crashed; [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>) standing before a crystallized wall of sunset colors; [Heartwood Grove](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/heartwood-grove.md>), now dark and rotting; and the northern outposts of Amberglow overtaken by the mysterious [Gloomshaper](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-umbraeth.md>). 

[Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) meets [Arendel](<../../../people/fey/arendel.md>), a renowned but cheerful and friendly duelist who challenges him on the spot. Their duel draws a crowd, including drawing back other members of the party who had wandered off. [Arendel](<../../../people/fey/arendel.md>) ultimately wins but acknowledges Delwath's skill. As payment, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) must entertain [Arendel](<../../../people/fey/arendel.md>) with stories for two days.

After the duel, the goes to find [Count Vashan](<../../../people/fey/count-vashan.md>), who is now calling himself "the broken mask". He is slumped at the edge of festivities, clearly deep in drink. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) boldly declares that [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) is alive, and [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) recognizes Vashan as one of Cloudspinner's most trusted servants, but the Count does not deign to speak of the past. Suspecting the fey wine is clouding his memories, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) channels his ki to temporarily suppress the magic afflicting Vashan's mind, jolting him to awareness of his past. 

The effect is immediate. [Count Vashan](<../../../people/fey/count-vashan.md>)'s eyes clear as the truth emerges: he betrayed [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), bringing [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) to the [Cloud Palace](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/cloud-palace.md>) during a moment of vulnerability, though whether intentionally or by accident, he can no longer remember. Though ashamed and angry, he offers crucial information: each of the keeps along the Sunset Gate contain hidden chambers allowing them to connect to the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>), once used as a means of communication, defense, and perhaps more--[Count Vashan](<../../../people/fey/count-vashan.md>) does not know. However, the connection to the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>) can only be activated by the light of pure sunset. 

After deliberation, the party decides to take the direct route, traveling west to the Sunset Gate and north to [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>) (where they hope that [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s magic can activate the connection to the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>)), rather than seeking the [Shrouded Archive](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/shrouded-archive.md>) and negotiating for access to the secrets kept within (which, one presumes, include the secret location of the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>)). They secure griffins from [Lord Soven](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-soven.md>), and prepare to set off. 

In preparation for departure, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) tames the wyvern trapped in the [Mirror of Soul Trapping](<../treasure/mirror-of-soul-trapping.md>), using food, wine, and his remarkable animal handling skills. Kenzo joins him atop the creature as they soar above [Sunwine Hall](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/sunwine-hall.md>), much to the astonishment of the gathered fey.

[Valeris](<../../../people/fey/valeris.md>) and [Ismara](<../../../people/fey/ismara.md>) agree to join their expedition, though [Ismara](<../../../people/fey/ismara.md>) expresses hesitation about continuing northward into [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>) and only promises to travel as far as the Sunset Gate. As the session ends, the seven travelers mount their griffins and wyvern, launching into the sky as they leave [Sunwine Hall](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/sunwine-hall.md>) behind, setting course for the Sunset Gate and the ruins of [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>) beyond.

- Kenzo separates from the group and moves to the edge of the party near one of the smaller bands.
- He attempts to commune with nature, something he has never done in the Feywild before.
- Instead of sensing plants and animals as he normally would, Kenzo experiences a riot of emotions emanating from the vegetation.
- The vines and plants are bursting with pleasure and sweetness, their emotions shifting in response to the party's moods.
- His communion produces sensory experiences like tasting the sweetness of a ripe peach.
- As his awareness extends outward, Kenzo notices some plants feel "overripe" or strained, reflecting the undercurrent of the revelers trying too hard to party.
- When asked about anomalies, Kenzo senses the Red River (river of wine) where plants along its banks sway from intoxication rather than from any breeze.

- Vashen shares that Cloud Spinner's keeps along the Sunset Gate each contained a drop of the Prism Well.
- He advises they search these keeps for a connection to the Prism Well, though they would need sunlight to see it.
- As Kenzo's cleansing touch fades, Vashen's memories slip away again.


### Plotting Their Course

## Wellby and Valeris - Extended Narrative

Wellby's eyes scanned the revelry, noting how the fey danced and laughed with abandon. Every face seemed caught in perpetual delight—which is why the pouting satyr caught his attention so immediately. Sitting apart from the merriment, the satyr cut a striking figure with his curling ram's horns wrapped in gold rings, his silk shirt half-buttoned, and a fiddle tucked under one arm.
Curious, Wellby approached and introduced himself with a friendly smile. "You're the first satyr I've met who isn't dancing. Why no celebration for you?"

The satyr looked up, his expression souring further. "Damn! Why do you have to ask that?" He sighed deeply, adjusting his position. "Well, I'm cursed. Everything I say has to be brutally and completely honest." His lips quirked into a sardonic smile. "You'd be surprised how often little white lies smooth over social graces. For example, I could say you look pretty out of place, but instead, all I can really say is, why did you come here, and why are you bothering me?"

Despite his harsh words, there was something oddly charming in his directness. Wellby, intrigued rather than offended, settled beside him.

"I've run into people with curses before and found ways to remove them," Wellby offered. "How did you come to be cursed? It doesn't look like any of these people would do that to you."

The satyr rolled his eyes. "It's a long story, and honestly, I'm pretty sick of telling it. But if you insist, I can't really say no so well." He glanced around before continuing. "I grew up here in Emberwine. It's a beautiful place, you can tell." He gestured broadly at the endless celebration. "Just looking around, you have to admit it's beautiful."

He explained how, at a revel much like this one, he encountered a woman named Yasara the Golden from Everlights Bloom. "She was beautiful, aloof, radiant," he recounted. "She walked through the world as if it was a story she was only half aware of."

When Yasara had sworn an oath of eternal love to her dance partner—an oath she clearly never intended to keep—the satyr had intervened. "I was arrogant," he admitted. "I wanted to prove that I could twist fate myself. Who wouldn't? A gambler who can change reality with stories... Come on! Isn't that the best thing you could tell of yourself?"

His eyes gleamed with remembered pride. "And I, to be brutally honest, I did it. I told a tale so compelling and strong that reality shifted around it, and her oath was undone." He paused, his momentary triumph fading. "And I could never lie again. Damn it, why did I waste my time with that stupid lady?"

"What are you looking forward to?" Wellby asked, changing the subject.

"The next cup of wine," the satyr responded flatly. "I don't know. Nothing really. Getting out of here." He explained that supposedly, one selfless act would end his curse. "But I tried that. Letting a mortal win at cards didn't work. Plus, it was tough anyway because everybody beats me at cards. Can't bluff, can't cheat, can't lie. Damn! I used to be such a good gambler."

The satyr continued, listing his failed attempts at selflessness—giving someone wine, trying to offer sincere compliments without following with criticism. "I don't want to leave because I'm afraid to wander around the Feywild in my current state. I don't really want to stay because everybody's sick of me telling the truth about them."

Wellby, recalling his mission, redirected the conversation. "I heard there's some refugee from Amberglow here."

"Oh, the broken mask!" The satyr perked up slightly. "He's a sad sack."
"Where is that dude?" Wellby pressed.

"He's always got his wherever the strongest wine is. That's where you'll find him." The satyr waved dismissively. "Don't bother talking to him. All he does is bemoan his fate."
"Is that not what you're doing this whole time?" Wellby countered with a knowing smile.
"It is what I'm doing, but—" The satyr began.
"If you had to be brutally honest?" Wellby's eyes twinkled.
"I can't even say I'm being interesting about it, because I know that I'm not. Damn it!" The satyr exclaimed, a reluctant laugh escaping him.
Changing tactics, Wellby asked, "What's gonna happen here when Harrow and Wend roll through?"
"We'll all die," came the blunt response.
"Why not prepare for that? Why not do something about that now?" Wellby challenged. "Why just let that happen?"
The satyr shook his head. "These are questions that I cannot answer, because what do I know of the doings of fey lords? The whole neighborhood went to hell when Cloud Spinner vanished."
"I mean—" Wellby began.
"If I'm being brutally honest, really, we just need her back," the satyr interrupted. "But that's never gonna happen."
Wellby noticed Kenzo subtly touching his necklace, where Cloud Spinner was imprisoned. "One of the things I want to do is go back through her old realm," Wellby said carefully. "Who here knows the ways around there? Who can guide me in and through?"
"You think that would count as a selfless act?" The satyr raised an eyebrow, interested for the first time.
"Worth a shot," Wellby affirmed. "Do you know the terrain there?"
"If I'm being brutally honest, I've never been to Amberglow specifically," the satyr admitted.
Their conversation turned to the Shrouded Archive, where all the Feywild's secrets were kept. "I bet I could find that," the satyr claimed.
"Really, if you're being brutally honest?" Wellby pressed.
"The trick is not so much finding it. It's figuring out how to pay the tax," the satyr explained.
"The tax?"
"I don't really know for sure. Everybody just says, you know, whines and complains about the toll I had to pay for X, Y, and Z." He frowned in concentration. "Nobody can ever say what they have to give up. It's like they can't tell what the payment was."
As their conversation continued, the satyr lamented his boring existence. "Most stories are only good because they're embellished," he explained with weary honesty. "Around here, not that many stories are good told straight. Most people don't actually lead very interesting lives since you mortals stopped coming through."
Seeing an opportunity, Wellby leaned forward. "Want to hear an interesting story that's all true?"
The satyr's eyes lit up with genuine interest. "I do."
And so Wellby began the tale of how they had stopped an emperor from becoming a god—a story remarkable enough that even without embellishment, it promised to captivate a truth-bound satyr starved for genuine entertainment.

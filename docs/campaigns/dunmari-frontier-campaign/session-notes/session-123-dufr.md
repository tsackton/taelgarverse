The party narrowly escapes shadowy pursuit, frees the archfey [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) at the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>), and restores hope to [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>) before journeying home.

## Session Info
### Summary
- The group escapes [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>)'s deadly darkness, with [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) making a heroic solo dash across the courtyard. 
- Following a magical trail to the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>), the party flees across [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>) on griffins and a wyvern, evading relentless shadow beasts through speed, invisibility, and strategic maneuvering.
- Arriving at the hidden [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>), they fend off warg archers and shadow creatures while preparing to release [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) from her prison.
- [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) telekinetically lifts and plunges [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>)'s crystal prison into the shimmering pool, while [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s powerful Sunburst banishes the attacking shadows.
- The[Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) emerges—restored, grateful, and imbued with sorrowful wisdom.
- [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) is gifted a magical hat for future planar return, and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) breaks the cursed crown's old bonds, rededicating it to liberating [orcs](<../../../species/orcs.md>) trapped under the sway of [Thark](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>). 
- The party leaves [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>) on the Rainbow Bridge, returning to [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>) and their awaiting crew.

## Narrative

Our session begins beneath the shattered tower of [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>), with the party in the radiant hall illuminated by [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)’s conjured sunlight. The room, now filled with echoes of sunset and shifting reflections, cast forth visions—the ancient towers lined against the ever-twilight border, the drifting [Cloud Palace](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/cloud-palace.md>), and the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>): a swirling pyramid of cloud and color, its basin brimming with liquid radiance. 

With the keep above cloaked in oppressive, physical darkness and a dread entity still channeling shadows from [Hollowdark](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/hollowdark.md>), the party weighed their escape options. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) fled via Dimension Door back to camp, where [Valeris](<../../../people/fey/valeris.md>) and the griffons waited, but [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) was forced to escape by flight. He sped alone through the halls, pressed in by unnatural gloom and the flicker of unseen terrors. Guided by his boots of speed and his sharp wits, he raced to the roof, where swarming darkness tried to seize him. Shadowy hands erupted from below; [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) dodged their grasp, even as necrotic energies struck him silent. Still, with one last desperate effort, he burst free, and landed amidst his allies outside the keep, as new winged horrors began to stir in the distant shadows.

After escaping the supernatural darkness, the party gathered and swiftly resaddles their mounts—three griffins and a wyvern, to flee [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>) as quickly as possible and find the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>), summoned by lighting the beacon beneath the tower. Although it cannot be seen from here, the visions provided a clear enough description for [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), who conjures a magical arrow, fires it into the sky, and watches as a shimmering trail of sunset-lit footprints appears, guiding him southwest to the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>). 

Mounting up, the group follows the trail, but soon spot three vast shadow beasts winging after them in pursuit. Realizing these foes are steadily gaining, [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) uses her dwarven rune to cast Longstrider on the wyvern and two griffins, granting them bursts of speed. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), with their griffins, become invisible and break away, hoping to scatter the pursuers. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) guides the wyvern in a distracting display, disorienting the shadows with a dramatic aerial display while the others streak ahead. The ruse succeeds—the shadow creatures fixate on the wyvern and lose track of the invisible members. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) later transform themselves and their griffins into sparrows, completely blending into the local fauna for safety.

Those in the lead continue along the river, the land’s colors intensifying as they near their goal. Wargs and duskhounds attempt to intercept from below, but the party stays high out of range, until at last the clouds part to reveal the radiant pyramid of the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>) gleaming ahead. The party descended, regrouping as everyone reaches sanctuary before their pursuers, shadow beasts from [Hollowdark](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/hollowdark.md>) and hunters from Duskmire alike, can close in.

Inside the shifting wall of clouds, the party saw the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>) itself, a shimmering pool of sunset-colored mist. Seeking to free [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), without an obvious better idea and under time pressure, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) used telekineses to lift the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>)'s crystal prison from the [Portable Hole](<../treasure/portable-hole.md>), and lower it into the pool. As it vanished from sight, for a moment, nothing happened. Then, the sharp whistle of arrows cut through the clouds: two struck harmlessly against [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)’s armor and narrowly missed [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) as hostile archers emerged from hidden positions. Meanwhile, tendrils of blackness began encroaching at the cloud’s edge. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) advanced through featureless cloud wall toward the sound of threatening creatures and, sensing the peril, unleashed a mighty Sunburst as the party braced for confrontation, eyes fixed on the pool where [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) had vanished.

Suddenly, the cloud wall burst into brilliant light, echoing and reflecting [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s sunburst spell as the tendrils of darkness that threatened to break through were burned away. Amidst the growing light, a figure floated from the pool: the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), the Queen of Sunsets, ancient archfey and ruler of [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>), now wreathed in clouds and blazing colors, her visage angry and sorrowful over what has befallen her realm. As light bursts forth from the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), the shadowy enemies lurking on the horizon collapse in screams. 

[Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), overcome, kneels as the spirit of [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) departs. The Cloudspinner addresses the party, offering gratitude and a promise: they will always be welcome in [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>). With a gesture, she grants [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) a shimmering, color-changing hat—an enchanted key allowing the party to return here by magic. 

[Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) seeks counsel about the [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>). The [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) explains the need for a worthy purpose, that the crown’s bonds of domination can be unraveled only by dedicating it to a new cause. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), resolved to aid the oppressed [orcs](<../../../species/orcs.md>) and foster new communities, places the crown on her head. Light flares out, severing countless bonds of control; a great burden lifts from her, while the crown’s shape settles into something more grounded and real.

The party exchanges farewells with the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), as [Valeris](<../../../people/fey/valeris.md>) stays behind to offer to help repair the realm and maybe free himself of his curse. Our session ends as the party uses the Rainbow Bridge to return to [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), reuniting with their crew and airship in the [Garamjala Desert](<../../../gazetteer/drankorian-hinterland/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>), at [Pava and Avaras' House](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/pava-and-avaras-house.md>).

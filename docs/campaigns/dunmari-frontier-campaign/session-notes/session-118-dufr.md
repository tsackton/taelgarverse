The [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) meets [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>), an ally of Cloudspinner seeking news, and faces a shadowy attack on [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>).

## Session Info
### Summary
- The [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), discussing the fate of the [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>), is interrupted by the arrival of [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) on a glowing stag.
- [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>), Lanternkeeper of [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>), seeks the imprisoned [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), recounting her history and the fall of [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>) to the encroaching darkness.
- [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is possessed by [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>), a fey presence from his past, who demands to see the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>).
- The party faces a massive attack by shadowy foes. With the aid of [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>)'s ice cannon and the party's talents, the dark fey are defeated, but [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) is killed.
- [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) warns of more threats approaching, prompting an urgent departure towards [Bitterwine Oak](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/bitterwine-oak.md>), a fey portal. 

### Timeline
- May 30, 1749 DR, evening: [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) arrives on [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>) seeking [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>). Meets the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>). [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is possessed by [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>). Fey creatures serving [Wend](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/wend.md>) and [Harrow](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/harrow.md>) arrive soon after, and attack. They are defeated, but [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) is killed. 

## Narrative
Our session begins in the evening, as the party discusses the fate of the [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>) on [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). They are interrupted by two events in quick succession. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s hair begins to desaturate, the white streak spreading unnaturally. At the same time, [Egnir](<../../../people/elves/egnir.md>)’s voice rings out in alarm. The party rushes onto the deck to witness a glowing amber stag galloping through the sky, [a woman](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) with flame-colored hair and molten amber eyes riding upon it, carrying a pulsating crystalline object radiating a warm reddish light. 

The woman, clearly [fey](<../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>), demands, in a shaking voice, "*Where is she? Release her if you have her. I serve the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), and I will have her returned."* Between [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)'s soul sight and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s detect thoughts spell, the party quickly realizes she is scared and nervous, but not a threat or an enemy. She introduces herself as [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>), Lanternkeeper of the [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>), bearer of the last [Amberlight](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>). The party agrees to take her to see [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), currently imprisoned in a translucent crystal block in [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>)'s hold. But, at the same time, it is apparent that Seeker's transformation is progressing rapidly. Kenzo pulls Seeker aside for a closer discussion, while the rest of the party walks with [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) and hears her story. 

[Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) says she came to be after the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) had left [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>), and it was already a place in decay. She lived at [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>), a fortress and refuge along the Sunset Gate, charged by the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) to protect the wall of sunset from the enroaching dark. Which they did, for a long time. Until, one day, the Sunset Gate cracked, and darkness flowed like a river from the realms beyond, [Darkfall](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/darkfall.md>) and [Hollowdark](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/hollowdark.md>). [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>) fell, and [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) fled with one of the [Amberlights](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>); as far as she knows, she is the only one who survived. She wandered for a long time; soon, the light of the [Amberlight](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>) faded, and she eventually settled in [Everlight's Bloom](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/everlight-s-bloom.md>), hopeless about the future of [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>). Until ten days ago, when the [Amberlight](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>) suddenly blazed awake. She followed its pulsing through the portal at the [Bitterwine Oak](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/bitterwine-oak.md>), to [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). Reaching the entrapped body of the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) collapsed in awe as her [Amberlight](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>) flared. 

Meanwhile, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), studying [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), sees two overlapping auras—[Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s own and an unfamiliar, panicked presence. Attempting *Cleansing Touch*, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) finds nothing to dispel; [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is not cursed, but seems to be carrying another presence with him. Soon, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s entire body desaturated, save for the once-white streak in his hair, which now burns a sunset red. At this point, he seemed fully possessed, speaking in an unfamiliar, high-pitched voice: *"Such color... it has been so long!"* Identifying herself as [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>), the entity demands to see the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>). [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) telepathically alerted the party, prompting them to bring [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) to speak with this new presence. When [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) shone her lantern’s light upon [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), a ghostly image of a tall, courtly woman appeared—grayscale, save for a single strand of sunset-colored hair.

[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) seemed to recognize [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>), or at least understand the places she referenced, and inquired about the fate of the other lantern keepers. [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) tearfully admitted she believed them all lost to the dangers on the borders: the [Gloomshaper](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-umbraeth.md>), [Harrow](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/harrow.md>), and [Wend](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/wend.md>). At this point, the party agreed to bring [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) to see the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>). As she arrived, she stumbled in awe and fear, uncertain but declaring that to free her, they must find the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>). Before further discussion could occur, though, [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) suddenly shouted that her steed was in danger and rushed upstairs. 

In the face of an attack, the party sounded the alarm, waking [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>), who rushed to arm the ice turret. Meanwhile, the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) -- and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) -- turned to confront a massive void of darkness that seems to be racing towards [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) struck first with an arrow of seeking, forcing the shadowy entity to recoil, but in retalitation, it unleashed a wave of blackness across the deck of [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). While [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) avoided harm entirely, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) managed to somewhat resist the effects, [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) suffered grievously, and [Lirien](<../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) and her steed were completely destroyed, swept away by the darkness, their bodies disintegrated, replaced by shades. The battle raged as the shades attacked [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) and [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>). [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) fought with precision, his strikes frightening the enemy. However, more shadows emerged, seven foot tall human-like creatures of darkness, carrying swords of night and emitting an aura of silence, preventing spellcasting and communication, speaking harshly:*"The [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) will not return. Silence will fall."*

With the battlefield looking grim, and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) falling unconscious from several attacks by more large flying shades, [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) finally reached the control room to activate the ice turret, and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) launched a massive _Sunburst_. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) -- teleported to safety by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s _Scatter_ spell -- revived with a stroke of luck, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s _Synaptic Static_ shattered the focus of several enemies. Still, the enemy pressed on, holding on against an ice barrage from [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>), a lightning arrow from [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), and a summoned construct from [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>). Finally, with the shadows weakening, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s Eldritch Blast, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>)'s arrows, and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>), polymorphed into a giant ape, ended the battle. 

Our session ended as [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) warn that others will be coming, and immediate departure is of the essence. [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) set course for the [Bitterwine Oak](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/bitterwine-oak.md>) fey portal and the party turned to rest.

## Narrative
Our session begins in the evening, as the party discusses the fate of the [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>) on [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). They are interrupted by two events in quick succession. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s hair begins to desaturate, the white streak spreading unnaturally. At the same time, [Egnir](<../../../people/elves/egnir.md>)’s voice rings out in alarm. The party rushes onto the deck to witness a glowing amber stag galloping through the sky, a woman with flame-colored hair and molten amber eyes riding upon it, carrying a pulsating crystalline object that radiating with a warm reddish light. 

The woman, clearly fey, demands, in a shaking voice, "*Where is she? Release her if you have her. I serve the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), and I will have her returned."* Between Kenzo's soul sight and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s detect thoughts spell, the party quickly realizes she is scared and nervous, but not a threat or an enemy. She introduces herself as Lirien, Lanternkeeper of the [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>), bearer of the last [Amberlight](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>). The party agrees to take her to see [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), currently imprisoned in a translucent crystal block in [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>)'s hold. But, at the same time, it is apparent that Seeker's transformation is progressing rapidly. Kenzo pulls Seeker aside for a closer discussion, while the rest of the party walks with Lirien and hears her story. 

Lirien says she came to be after the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) had left, and [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>) was already a place in decay. She lived at [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>), a fortress and refuge along the Sunset Gate, charged by the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) to protect the wall of sunset from the enroaching dark. Which they did, for a long time. Until, one day, the Sunset Gate cracked, and darkness flowed like a river from the realms beyond, [Darkfall](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/darkfall.md>) and [Hollowdark](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/hollowdark.md>). [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>) fell, and Lirien fled with one of the Amberlights; as far as she knows, she is the only one who survived. She wandered for a long time; soon, the light of the [Amberlight](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>) faded, and she eventually settled in [Everlight's Bloom](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/everlight-s-bloom.md>), hopeless about the future of [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>). Until ten days ago, when the [Amberlight](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>) suddenly blazed awake. She followed its pulsing through the portal at the [Bitterwine Oak](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/bitterwine-oak.md>), to [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). Reaching the entrapped body of the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), Lirien collapsed in awe as her [Amberlight](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>) flared. 

Meanwhile, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), studying [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), sees two overlapping auras—[Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s own and an unfamiliar, panicked presence. Attempting *Cleansing Touch*, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) finds nothing to dispel; [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is not cursed, but seems to be carrying another presence with him. Soon, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s entire body desaturated, save for the once-white streak in his hair, which now burns a sunset red. At this point, he seemed fully possessed, speaking in an unfamiliar, high-pitched voice: *"Such color... it has been so long!"* Identifying herself as [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>), the entity demands to see the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>). [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) telepathically alerted the party, prompting them to bring Lirien to speak with this new presence. When Lirien shone her lantern’s light upon [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), a ghostly image of a tall, courtly woman appeared—grayscale, save for a single strand of sunset-colored hair.

[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) seemed to recognize Lirien, or at least understand the places she referenced, and inquired about the fate of the other lantern keepers. Lirien tearfully admitted she believed them all lost to the dangers on the borders: the [Gloomshaper](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-umbraeth.md>), [Harrow](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/harrow.md>), and [Wend](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/wend.md>). At this point, the party agreed to bring [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) to see the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>). As she arrived, she stumbled in awe and fear, uncertain but declaring that to free her, they must find the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>). Before further discussion could occur, though, Lirien suddenly shouted that her steed was in danger and rushed upstairs. 

In the face of an attack, the party sounds the alarm, waking [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>), who rushes to arm the ice cannon. Meanwhile, the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) -- and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) -- turn to confront a massive void of darkness that seems to be racing towards [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) strikes first with an arrow of seeking, forcing the shadowy entity to recoil, but it retalitation, it unleashed a wave of blackness across the deck of [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). While [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) avoided harm entirely, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) managed to somewhat resist the effects, [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) suffered greviously, and Lirien and her steed were completely destroyed, swept away by the darkness, their bodies disintegrated, replaced by shadowy shades. The battle raged as the shades attacked [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) and [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>). [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) fought with precision, his strikes frightening the enemy. However, more shadows emerged, seven foot tall human-like creatures of darkness, carrying swords of night and emitting an aura of silence, preventing spellcasting and communication, speaking harshly:*"The [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) will not return. Silence will fall."*

With the battlefield looking grim, and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) falling unconscious from several attacks by more large flying shades, [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) finally reached the control room to activate the ice cannon, and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) launched a massive _Sunburst_. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) -- teleported to safety by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s _Scatter_ spell -- revives himself in a stroke of luck, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s _Synaptic Static_ shattered the focus of several enemies. Still, the enemy pressed on, holding on against an ice barrage from [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>), a lightning arrow from [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), and a summoned construct from [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>). Finally, with the shadows weakening, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s Eldritch Blast, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>)'s arrows, and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>), polymorphed into a giant ape, ended the battle. 

The session ends as [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)/[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) warns that others will be coming, and immediate departure is of the essence, as [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) set course for the [Bitterwine Oak](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/bitterwine-oak.md>) fey portal and the party turned to rest.

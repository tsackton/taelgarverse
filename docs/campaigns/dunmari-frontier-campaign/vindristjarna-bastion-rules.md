# Vindristjarna Bastion Mechanics

Vindristjarna carries with it a number of special facilities that provide in game benefits. Currently, Vindristjarna has the following special facilities, described in detail below, and associated with the following people.

This document also describes additional magic items that are permanently installed on [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). 
## Special Facility Rules

*Special Facility Mechanics: As a way to balance the goals of keeping to the spirit of the bastion rules, while also maintaining in-world verisimilitude, the following rules apply to Vindristjarna Special Facilities.*

(1) Some special facilities have prerequisites. If a special facility has prerequisites that a character does not meet, they may still choose that special facility as long as (i) there is a good role-playing rationale, and (ii) the character is at least 4 levels higher than the special facility level.
(2) Vindristjarna is mobile, which makes it more powerful than many bastions. As a trade-off, it can only host bastions up to a fixed size, after which there is no more room to expand. The upper and lower decks are each 480 squares, while the hold is only 185 squares due to the slope of the sides. 
(3) Bastion facilities have a number of effects. While anything that only requires you to rest in the Bastion will obviously function as expected, anything that requires work needs a person to do the work (although "combined" facilities can generally be worked by a single follower, and in general we can assume followers are more productive and useful than a typical "Bastion hireling"). This is just meant to reflect the trade off between mobility and the fact you can't support as large a crew as a fixed Bastion could support.
(4) Each character can have a single level 17 facility and no more than two level 13 facilities.

A Bastion Turn represents a period of time, usually around 7 days, of uninterrupted time on [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). During a Bastion Turn, each Follower and PC can fulfill one set of special facility orders, or more as otherwise noted. A PC cannot both fulfill a set of orders and benefit from a special facility that requires eight hours a day of work. 

> [!info]+ Example Bastion Turn
> 
> While traveling to Chardon to instigate trouble, the party takes a Bastion Turn. It might go like this:
> 
> *Faldrak*, while piloting the ship, takes the Craft option from the Workshop to make a Potion of Growth, an Uncommon consumable item. It will take 5 days of work and 100 gold to finish. During the evenings, Faldrak also searches the skies in the Observatory. However, at the end of the Bastion Turn he rolls a 4, an even number, and so gains nothing from this activity.
> 
>*Amil* tends to the Hall of Stories, taking the Research (Lore) option, to learn something about chalyte from the stories recorded. At the end of the Bastion Turn, he will learn three pieces of information to communicate to the party. 
>
>*Egnir* tends the Garden and Greenhouses. He can carry out the Harvest order three times, and produces 100 days of Rations, 10 Candles, and a Potion of Healing (Greater).
>
>*Jotha* serves as Weapon Expert in the Sparring Room. She can train with any PC to give them the benefits of the Weapon Expert feature.
>
>*Mica* serves as a Skill Expert in the Game Room. He can train with any PC to give them the benefits of the Skill Expert feature.
>
>*Willow* pours over the maps in the Map Room, taking the Research option to learn about Mitus Verina Auratan, the Magistros of Chardon. At the end of the Bastion Turn, she will learn three pieces of information to communicate to the party.
>
>As the ship is not docked in Tollen, Adam Gower does nothing.
> 
>**Delwath** trains with *Jotha* in the Sparring Room for 8 hours per day. For the next 7 days, he can use the Mastery property of his Longsword. Since he takes a Long Rest in the Bastion, he also gains a tanshi Charm from the Sanctuary that lets him cast Healing Word once in the next 7 days, without using a spell slot. Finally, when he leaves Vindristjarna, he picks three fruits from the Greenhouse. Each fruit can be consumed in the next 24 hours by any creature; when consumed it has the effect of the Lesser Restoration spell
>
>**Seeker** spends time in the Archive, Researching for 8 hours per day to seek esoteric knowledge of Bronzehall, a rumored city on the Plane of Fire where Frankar was seen, according to the [Philosopher's Information Concerning Frankar](<letters-and-notes/philosopher-s-information-concerning-frankar.md>). He gains the effect of casting the Legend Lore spell targeting Bronzehall. Since he takes a Long Rest in the Bastion, he also gains a esoteric Charm from the Observatory that lets him cast Contact Other Plane once in the next 7 days, without using spell slots. Finally, when he takes a Short Rest in the Bastion, he gains Heroic Inspiration from the Workshop. 
>
>**Kenzo** meditates at the base of the Elven Tree for 8 hours per day. At the end of the Bastion Turn, he rolls a 1 and a 4 on the d6s, and for the next 7 days has Advantage on any Strength or Intelligence Saving Throws.
>
>**Wellby** trains with *Mica* in the Game Room for 8 hours per day, practicing his comic timing. At the end of the Bastion Turn, he gains Proficiency in the Performance skill for the next 7 days.

> >Game Effect: [Pub](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/bastions#Pub)
> >Size: 16 squares (Roomy)
> >Order: Research
> 
>Folks come here to consume tasty beverages and socialize. Your Pub might be a bar, coffee shop, or tea room, and it might have a colorful name, such as the Rusty Flagon or the Dragon’s Loft. The facility’s hireling, who serves as the bartender, maintains a network of spies scattered throughout nearby communities. These spies are useful sources of information and frequent the Pub, often incognito.
>
>**_Research: Information Gathering._** When you issue the [Research](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/bastions#Research) order to this facility, you commission the Pub’s bartender to gather information from spies who are aware of all important events happening within 10 miles of your Bastion over the next 7 days. During that time, these spies can divulge the location of any creature that is familiar to you, provided the creature is within 50 miles of your Bastion and not hidden by magic or confined to a location that the DM deems is beyond the spy network’s ability to locate. If the spies learn the target’s location, they also learn where that creature has been for the previous 7 days.
>
>**_Pub Special._** The Pub has one magical beverage on tap, chosen from the options below:
>
>**Bigby’s Burden.** Drinking a pint of this beverage grants you the “enlarge” effect of an [Enlarge/Reduce](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619170-enlarge-reduce) spell that has a duration of 24 hours (no saving throw allowed).
>
>**Kiss of the Spider Queen.** Drinking a pint of this beverage grants you the effect of a [Spider Climb](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619071-spider-climb) spell that has a duration of 24 hours.
>
>**Moonlight Serenade.** Drinking a pint of this beverage gives you [Darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) out to 60 feet for 24 hours. If you already have Darkvision, its range is extended by 60 feet for the same duration.
>
>**Positive Reinforcement.** Drinking a pint of this beverage gives you Resistance to Necrotic damage for 24 hours.
>
>**Sterner Stuff.** For 24 hours after drinking a pint of this beverage, you automatically succeed on saving throws to avoid or end the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition.
>
>At the start of a Bastion turn, you can switch to one of the other options. Your DM may create new options. A pint of this magical beverage loses its magic 24 hours after it’s poured.

The object can be no bigger than 5 feet in any dimension; can’t have a value over 5 GP; and must be made of wood, stone, clay, porcelain, glass, paper, nonprecious crystal, or nonprecious metal.

The object can be no bigger than 5 feet in any dimension; can’t have a value over 5 GP; and must be made of wood, stone, clay, porcelain, glass, paper, nonprecious crystal, or nonprecious metal. You must finish a Long Rest before you can take this action again.

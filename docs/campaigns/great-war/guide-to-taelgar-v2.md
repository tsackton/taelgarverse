Working Document – Cosmology, Magic, Races, and Religion 

Version 1.0 

[please update version when editing] 

Updates: some info on races in more detail, incorporate of comments from emails --> version 1.1 will include detail on all PC races (Ogre, Dwarves, Lizardmen, Halflings, Kenku) as well as Hobgoblins and Liontaurs, who, while not typically PC races, are within the power limits of typical PCs.  Version 1.1 should also answer most of the questions about cosmology or metaphysics. 

Still to do:  Ogre, Halflings, Kenku 

       Hobgoblins, Liontaurs 

Many names in this document need to be replaced.  Suggestions for new names are welcome and encouraged. 

Please pay particular attention to ‘**Questions:’ headings.  These are the areas that I think are in particular need of comment and work. 

Notes from emails for next update: 

Astrology: 

>Any reason for the Sun to have any astrological effects at all? In other

>Guardian, but the Guardian. Just a note: when races are better defined, 

>the planetary effects should be revisted. I think the effects of astrology 

>on magic should be real, but they need to be revisted when magic is more

>related to the races, although how I'm not sure. I actually think that the 

>moon should be the primary real influence on human magic, and that 

>astrology (as a real phenomena, not as a palor game) should be primarily a 

>firstborn race one. 

There is a reason for the Sun to have astrological effects.  However, it doesn't need to be a "Guardian" like the Moon.  I would say that the Sun and the Moon primarily effect non-Firstborn races (no reason for them to effect just humans, right?) and Kenku, who don't have their own planet because of their unusual beginnings.  The planets would primarily effect the Firstborn race they correspond to.  And yes, the planetary effects do need to be revisited as the races are fleshed out.  Astrology in general, I think, should be mostly a subtle thing that influences major magic, not an everyday kind of thing that you must always be taking into account.  Astrological effects on magic don't need to be clearly defined -- in fact, it might be best if they weren't clearly defined, but instead left as a vague sense of what might happen. 

Magic:  

>Realm of Taelgar magic could also include mother-earthy type things. 

>Healing could be done through it, for example, although i think that 

>healing could be done through other sorts of magic as well. 

I'm not quite sure what you're thinking here.  Perhaps Taelgar itself has names of power that one could learn and use to draw on the power inherent in Taelgar.....? 

>In general I like the racial magics. I am inclined to think that combat 

>speed magic should rarely be possible, but that proper preparation should 

>allow magic to be useful in combat. For example, rituals for arcane magic 

>take to long to be of use in combat directly, but they could be used to 

>prepare an effect that could go off with a word (for example, enchanting 

>stones to explode when thrown could be a way to create fireballs -- but 

>making a single fireball could take a day, and it would require a trigger 

>of some sort to go off, so that it wouldn't be possible for the mage to 

>arm an army with fireballs). I definetly like a psionic-type general 

>thought magic. 

This has been basically my thoughts for combat magic.  I think Realm of Thought magic should have a faster time scale in general (so psionics would perhaps be combat scale).  Any comments?  But in general, I think that the idea of "pre-casting" spells so that they can be set off with a word would work really well, giving mages the flexibility to use magic in combat or combat-like situations, but leave the flavor of magic as ritualistic.  I'll work out the exact rules as I get things going with this mini-campaign. 

>I may have more detailed thoughts on religion later, but I think that the 

>priesthood should include both men and women, a mother goddess is a good 

>idea, and her influence/worship should be more widespread, and not just in 

>rural/less advanced areas of the world. 

A few comments on religion: first, in the most "true" sense, there is one Deity that is neither masculine nor feminine.  However, most races and cultures on Taelgar do not perceive the Deity in that way.  Rather, there are a variety of different ways of perceived the Deity, based on a variety of things, especially culture.  I haven't yet really thought about the ways that I want different human cultures to perceive the Deity, except that Chardon/Sembara and related areas heavily influenced by the Drankorian empire should have one view, Dunmar should have another, different view, and the cultures to the Northwest, like Comor that never fell under the influence of Drankor should have a third, still different view.  I'll get to more of this when I get to typing up the next batch of the Taelgar documents, covering history, ethnic groups, and current religion/politics/culture, etc.  If anyone has any ideas.... 

On Kenku: 

hmm, a suggestion to differentiate kenku telepathy from others:  I think 

that it was originally within "line of sight" why not make it require eye 

contact?  this is more powerful than it sounds if part of the kenku racial 

package is great distance eyesight, but might be a good limitation and 

differentiation from the halfling variety.  also note that it's only 

kenku-kenku communication 

Cosmology: 

Basic Overview:  Taelgar is at the center of a multiverse consisting of: the Realm of Taelgar itself, with associated lunar, solar, planetary, and stellar spheres; the Realm of the Deity, which fades from “pure” good at the very top to “pure” evil at the very bottom; the Realm of Magic; the Realm of Thought, which includes the plane of consciousness, the dreamworld, and the astral plane; and the Realm of the Void.  The Realm of the Deity is essentially inaccessible to living mortals of Taelgar, except through direct Divine Intervention.  The Realm of Magic makes occasional contact points with the Realm of Taelgar, and is in very special cases directly accessible.  The Realm of Thought makes direct contact with individuals in Taelgar, and can be accessed with special and rare methods.  The Realm of the Void can be sought from either the Realm of Magic or the Realm of Thought. 

The Realm of Taelgar:  The physical world of Taelgar occupies the center of a spherical dimension consisting of the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars, arranged in concentric circles around the world of Taelgar.  Taelgar itself is a disc shaped world (see world map). Taelgar exists in the terrestrial realm, where normal Newtonian physics apply.  Beyond the upper atmosphere of Taelgar, in the boundary region between air and aether, are the Sun and the Moon.  The Moon, or Inner Guardian, occupies the region bordering the atmosphere, on the inner edge of the boundary region.  It goes through phases each month.  It represents and reflects the cooling, calming essence of air, coalesced to a sphere in the outermost reaches of the atmosphere.  When the Moon is full, astrological influences from the outer spheres are dampened, but when it is new, astrological influences can come through in full force.  The Moon is a particularly auspicious and important sign for beginnings and endings, for calm, relaxation, peace, and also for protection against the opposites of those things: anger, rashness, agitation, war, violence.  The Sun occupies the region bordering the aether, on the outer edge of the boundary region.  The Sun represents and reflects the burning, fiery energy of the aether.  The Sun does not have the same guardian properties as the moon, although it is worth noting that astrological effects are slightly more noticeable at night, and hugely more noticeable during a solar eclipse.  The Sun is a particularly auspicious and important sign for momentous decisions, for vigor, power, royalty, wealth, clarity of thought and purpose, revelation, epiphany, and also for protection against the opposites of those things: indecisiveness, weakness, sickness, poverty, confusion, ignorance. 

Beyond the [boundary realm], in the aethereal realm itself, are five celestial spheres, one representing each of the true races with a firstborn (halflings, lizardmen, dwarves, ogres, elves).  Closest to the earth, representing the halflings, is [Mercury], The Wanderer.  This planet is characterized both by its relative small size and by its erratic and hard to predict motion.  It is particularly auspicious for journeys (especially sea voyages), luck, partings, safe travel, money, business transactions.  Beyond [Mercury] is [Venus], The Healer, representing the lizardmen.  It is particularly auspicious for healing, health, long life, births, stamina, unity, wisdom.  Beyond [Venus] is [Mars], The Smith, representing the dwarves.  This planet is particular auspicious for crafts, mining, building, and new things, but also discipline, honor, dignity, companionship, loyalty.  Beyond [Mars] is [Jupiter], The Warrior, representing the ogre.  This planet is particularly auspicious for battles, honor, making a decision to fight or not, compromise, diplomacy, and also wisdom, nobility, chivalry, fairness.  Finally, the last planet before the celestial realm is [Saturn], The Lord (sometimes considered the Lord-Scholar or the Mage), represents the elves.  This planet represents knowledge, nobility (but also arrogance), anything distant or ancient, magic.   

Beyond the aethereal realm is the celestial realm itself, which has two spheres: the fixed stars and the changeable stars.  The sphere of the fixed stars contains the ecliptic (band of stars through which the planets pass – Zodiac constellations) and other constellations that never change and have been around since time began.  These stars are only astrologically significant in that they mark where the planets are at any one time.  The sphere of the changeable stars, however, contains the constellations of great heroes like Beryl, sometimes Dragons, or other mythical figures.  These constellations have some sort of “consciousness” in a vague sense (at least in that you could find them somewhere, hidden away in the Realm of Though), and can influence astrological properties in interesting ways.   

Quick summary: terrestrial realm, contains Taelgar; [boundary] realm, contains Sun and Moon; aethereal realm, contains planets; celestial realm, contains fixed and changeable stars. 

Astrology is primarily important to magic, although it can influence other aspects of life in ways that are not completely understood.  Birth signs are not particularly important in determining fates, and astrology has very little predictive power in that sense.  Nevertheless, in certain areas at certain times using astrological charts for predictive purposes can get very popular, primarily among nobles and aristocrats who are not magicians.  The Sun and the Moon have the most powerful astrological effects (particularly the Moon), but the planets also do influence things, and can be heavily influenced by the Moon.  In any case, astrology works in three ways: each planet has certain traits it can impart to things done under its influence, each planet has certain things that is particularly capable of influencing, and each planet has certain correspondences which can enhance or depress its effects or the effect of the thing in correspondence to the planet.  An example of each one follows: 

Ex 1:  A mage wants to create a particularly potent charm to protect a caravan of his goods and money going South to trade.  When [Mercury] is in ascendance, particularly if it is in conjunction with [Saturn], or if the Moon is new, he will be more likely to be able to make an especially powerful charm. 

Ex 2:  A king wants to conceive an heir at a particularly auspicious time.  When [Jupiter] is in ascendance, or when [Saturn] tempered by [Venus] is in ascendance would be particularly good times.  Also, making sure the Sun is in a good house could be important. 

Ex 3:  A mage is shaping some particularly fine amethyst for use as a powerstone.  Because of the correspondence between amethyst and [Saturn], the mage will be able to create a better item if he works when [Saturn] is in ascendance.   

**Questions regarding the Realm of Taelgar: How much astrology is too much?  Should it solely affect magic, and more specifically ritual magic?  Should certain parts of astrology function much stronger than others?  What should the effect of astrology on non-humans be?  How should firstborn physically relate to planets, or should they?  How much detail needs to be made up (i.e., how many correspondences should be known for each planet, how many traits, how many situations in which they matter)?  Anything left out?  Is there anything wrong with using real astrology tables to determine when each planet is where? 

The Dreamworld: The Dreamworld is an echo, shadow, and premonition of Taelgar.  The Dreamworld is a realm that contains echoes of the present, past, and future blended together.  Prophecy, and the ability to sense the past associations of an object are strongly tied to connections to the Dreamworld.  The Dreamworld can also, under the influence of a powerful master, be used to send messages, influence dreams, and similar things.  It is at once a part of, and not a part of, Taelgar. 

The Realm of the Void:  The Realm of the Void is the only space left over from the previous multiverse, from which dragons and Araht/Melchior came.  In mythology it is typically known as the void in which the gods awoke.  It is a that is both impermanent and constant – literally, it is nothing, and thus has no permanent form to disappear.  It is accessible from Taelgar by mystical means, but it tends to destroy the minds of those who access it unless they are highly prepared.  Mystics that can reach this Realm and survive, however, are able to develop profound insights due to the nature of the Realm.  Cosmologically, it is crucially important as a source and ground of the Realm of the Deity, out of which everything else flows.  So in a sense, it is accurate to think of the Realm of the Void as the foundation on which the multiverse rests.   

The Realm of the Deity:  The Realm of the Deity is the domain of Araht/Melchior.  In the mythology of many races, it is imagined as two distinct Realms, “heaven” and “hell,” but in reality, since Araht/Melchior are one, there is no clear distinction.  This Realm is a giant sphere that encompassed the entire multiverse of Taelgar.  At the northern pole is the pure embodiment of Araht, and at the southern pole is the pure embodiment of Melchior.  Within the Realm in between, various minor embodiments of Araht/Melchior dwell.  The entire Realm is a confusing tangle and sensory overload that is in some sense the exact opposite of the Realm of the Void, but would still drive normal mortals insane.  It ranges from the most wonderful vision of heaven, to the most horrifying vision of hell, through everything in between.  Although inaccessible to normal mortals, some unique individuals have been known to make their way into this Realm. 

The Realm of Magic:  The Realm of Magic is the source of all weave-based magic, which includes True Magic, normal Arcane Magic, Gemstone Magic, and Runic Magic.  This Realm is interleaved through Taelgar – ley lines and nodes are both manifestations of the realm of magic in Taelgar.  Access to the Realm of Magic is possible for very experienced magicians, but it is very, very dangerous, as the Realm of Magic is so high mana that very unpredictable things can happen and very strange magical creatures sometimes live there.         

The Realm of Thought:  The Realm of Thought is the source of all thought-based magic, which includes Thought Magic, Halfling, Lizardman, Kenku and Ogre racial magic, some other powers, and psionics (such as they exist outside of racial magic).  The primary manifestation of the Realm of Thought accessible through Taelgar is the Astral Plane, sometimes known as the Plane of Consciousness.  

The Plane of Consciousness is a manifestation of the consciousnesses/souls of all beings on Taelgar.  Telepathy derives from access to the Plane of Consciousness, as do several other similar psionic powers.  Access to the Plane of Consciousness can also be used, like the Ogres, for strengthening your own powers, focus, and concentration.     

Mini-Realms, Pocket Dimensions, and Other Oddities:  These exist.  A notable example is the pocket dimension of the Tayledras, but there are certainly others.   

Magic: 

Ties to the Realms:  All of magic in Taelgar is ultimately derived from resonances contained in the five Realms: Taelgar, Magic, Thought, Divine, and Nothingness.  Magic is a fundamental property of organized structures bound into Realms of existence.  The ways in which the magic of the five Realms can be accessed, and the ways in which it manifests, are unique to each Realm. Briefly, the properties of the magic of the five Realms are described below.    

Magic from the Realm of Magic is magic in the traditional sense.  It is based on currents of magical energy, that are tuned to certain affinities.  By associating currents of the proper affinities in the right proportions, it is possible to create an essentially unlimited number of effects.  The Realm of Magic is tied to Taelgar by ley lines and nodes: these are points where 

the two Realms are interspersed.         

Magic from the Realm of Thought is mental power, the ability to detect, manipulate, and utilize the consciousness and the echoes of consciousness. Many traditional psionic powers would be similar to the effects created with this magic.  Much of the magic of this Realm involves perception, communication, concealment, or confusion.  Magic in this Realm works by directly affecting the minds and thoughts of the target.  The Realm of Thought and the Realm of Taelgar intersperse through consciousnesses.     

Magic from the Realm of the Divine is the magic of creation and destruction.  This magic can influence metaphysical structures themselves, be used to create races, Realms, or mini-dimensions, and fold the fabric of the universe in a far more powerful way than other forms of magic can.  This is the magic of dragons, gods, and firstborn, not mortals. 

Magic from the Realm of the Void is the magic of wishes, thoughts, and impulses, and also the magic of the imagined, the magic of wisdom and of fantasy.  No one is quite sure how it works, or how to use it, or really anything about it.  Although some items powered by this magic exist on Taelgar, and there are strange, mysterious individuals with some passing acquaintance to this magic.  It is the only magic that can counteract Divine magic.   

Magic from the Realm of Taelgar is the Dreamworld.  The Dreamworld is a part of Taelgar, in the sense that it is an echo, shadow, and premonition of the plane of Taelgar.  Prophecy comes from the magic of the Dreamworld.  Also, the magic of Taelgar is the magic of the links that allow powerful individuals to access other Realms, and use that magic.  Thus, names and the ability to utilize the power of names of beings, whether living, dead, or immortal, is a magic of Taelgar.   

Racial factors:  There are two classes of magic – unique racial magic of the Firstborn races, and generic magic not tied to a particular race.  There are also limitations on the magic that any one race can have access to, as follows: 

1.  All races potentially have access to Taelgar magic (prophecy/dreamworld, religious/spirit/name magic) 

2.  Firstborn races potentially have access to either the Realm of Thought or the Realm of Magic.  They have a special, their-race-only type of magic based upon this Realm, and they can also potentially learn any of the more generic forms of access to that Realm.  They cannot, however, learn access to the other Realm. 

3.  Humans and hobgoblins potentially have access to all of the more generic forms of access, to either Realm 

4.  Other races have access to a variety of magic depending on the circumstances of their creation.  Faeries and Giants, for example, have access to only their own unique form of magic, based on their existence as living reflections of Taelgar.  Eldrake, presuming they are somehow a manifestation of the Realm of Magic, would perhaps potentially have access to all Realm of Magic magics, but nothing else.  Liontaurs, for example, could be like humans. 

The unique racial magics would be as follows, to be described below: 

Elves -- something like true magic 

Ogre -- Stone magic 

Dwarves -- Runic magic 

Lizardmen -- Shamanistic magic 

Halflings -- Bardic magic 

Kenku -- Deception/Concealment magic 

The generic magics would be as follows: 

True Magic -- total control over Realm of Magic 

Thought Magic -- total control over Realm of Thought 

Arcane Magic -- typical ritual magic 

Gemstone magic -- modified form of typical ritual magic 

modified Psionics -- generic access to Realm of Thought 

**Questions about this system:  First, is it a good between total flexibility for all, and hard-and-fast limitation?  Second, do you think there need to be more kinds of generic magic mentioned at the start?  Or fewer?  I’ve been thinking that potential access means that it could be taken as an advantage, for example, but do you think the Firstborn races should all have some rudimentary skill in their unique racial magic?  Or should only the “mages” have it?  Finally, any other comments would be appreciated. 

Realm of Magic: 

Magics based on the Realm of Magic: 

Arcane Magic 

Gemstone Magic 

Runic (Dwarven) Magic 

Elven Magic 

True Magic 

The basic idea behind all this magic is controlling currents of magical energy, attuned to one of ten different properties: fire, air, water, earth, magic, life, death, body, soul, mind. 

**Question: do you think that these properties are good or not?  Suggestions for change if any?    

Arcane magic:  This is the most common kind of magic on Taelgar, the "standard" mage magic.    Basically, this magic uses rituals and ritual elements to direct the currents of magical energy into the proper patterns and affinities.  There are many standard rituals of a variety of different schools and traditions, and it is also possible, if difficult to create improvised and new rituals.  Most rituals require some ability to sense magical currents to carry out, in order to properly direct the energy, but there are some simple rituals that can be learned and used without this ability.   

**Question: should any form of combat-speed magic be available, or should a mage's combat effectiveness depend on enchanting one shot items and such?  Pros: fun to play, unlikely to unbalance magic if handled properly, keeps the spirit of magic users on Taelgar as able to function as potent battle mages intact.  Cons: could seem forced or dictated by meta-game concerns, could change the character of magic in a negative way.  Feel free to add to either side.  I still haven’t made a decision yet.  Even if Arcane magic doesn’t allow combat speed magic, should Gemstone magic be able to overcome that limitation? 

Gemstone magic:  Gemstone magic acts as a magnifying glass, using chalyte to amplify the ability of the user to see magic currents.  You need some ability to see the currents already to benefit.  Essentially, this allows mages proficient in arcane magic to gain some of the advantages of True Magic, and could potentially help other Realm of Magic spellcasters.  Need to think about exactly how, but this is a baseline idea.  Chalyte carries major risks, however.  It can easily backlash, causing extensive damage to the mage, and also can leech health and will by normal use.  Something odd about the gemstone itself, somehow.        

Runic Magic:  Runic Magic uses runes to set patterns of magical currents and produce desired effects.  Runes are used most effectively as part of crafted items, but can also be drawn in the air (or something like that) to create more immediate effects. 

Elven magic:  Elven magic is in a lot of ways very similar to True Magic.  It is based on the fact that elves have the ability to see currents clearly, but it does not allow quite the freedom of True Magic. 

True Magic:  True magic is the ability to see, understand, and manipulate individual currents with nothing but the power of the mind.  There isn't really a limit to what you can do with True Magic, nor is there much structure -- effects are created by putting together currents in the right amounts and kinds.  The power of an effect created with True Magic is based on your ability to manipulate the proper currents, your ability to channel the energy of the Realm of Magic through those currents, and the amount of energy you devote to the effort.  In other words, skill, power level, and fatigue expended. 

Realm of Thought: 

Magics based on the Realm of Thought: 

Stone (Ogre) Magic 

Shamanistic (Lizardman) Magic 

Bardic (Halfling) Magic 

Deception (Kenku) Magic 

Thought Magic 

Psionics 

Stone (Ogre) magic:  Ogre magic has three aspects.  One aspect is the ability to control the individual, subjective, personal time.  This means that Ogre masters are deadly in combat, because they can speed up their reaction time and fight really fast.  They can also control metabolism and slow down their subjective time.  The second aspect is the ability to mentally manipulate their bodies.  This can include powers like hardening their bodies, and various cinematic martial arts moves along these lines.  Finally, ogre have power over the very stone among which they live, allowing them to influence the shape of stone around them by understanding and shaping the "consciousness" of the rock.  There may be other powers related to this as well. 

Shamanistic (Lizardman) magic:  Lizardman magic is based on the fact that some essence or spirit form of the ancestors of the Lizardmen return to nature upon death, and have a dual existence in the Realm of Thought and the Realm of Taelgar.  Lizardman magic utilizes those spirits to perform a variety of effects, including healing, retrocognition (the ability to sense the past), many powers related to nature and the elements, and telepathy related powers, among other things.  Their powers work through a form of shamanistic magic, which requires a trance state in order to communicate with the spirits and ancestors.  Lizardmen are also capable of feats of out-of-body experience, and other related mystical powers – perhaps even the ability to possess the bodies of various animals.   

**Question: should combat speed lizardman magic be possible?  Probably not.  What do you think of this system for Lizardmen?  Do you think it works? 

Bardic (halfling) magic:  Halfling magic is based on the ability to persuade, convince, and communicate.  Although called bardic magic, it is not necessarily based on singing or performing.  It includes several related abilities: the ability to magically sway other people, the ability to radiate an aura of good will, telepathy and many related powers, including access to a racial memory, and also the ability to influence the perceptions of individuals.  For example, a halfling could become invisible by influencing the perceptions of the individuals around, so that they would never register the presence of anyone. 

**Question: should combat speed halfling magic be possible?  In some cases, yes, I would say..  What do you think of this system for halflings?  Do you think it works? 

Deception (kenku) magic:  Kenku magic is based on deception, form changing, and concealment.  It includes some weak forms of telepathy designed for secret communication, but it is primarily focused on powers like: shapeshifting, gray man, masking consciousness, and other forms of illusion or concealment.   

Thought Magic:  Thought Magic is the True Magic equivalent of the Realm of Thought.  This means that practitioners can enter the Realm of Thought and manipulate it in many different ways.  This includes making constructs like Kyr did, and influencing and even entering consciousnesses.         

Psionics:  This would be the generic form of Realm of Thought access, loosely based on traditional psionic powers.  It would involve, essentially, the ability to utilize the link to the Realm of Thought to do thinks with your mind.   

**Question:  Do you think kenku, halfling, and lizardman magic are all sufficiently distinct, and are all three distinct enough from generic psionics?   

**Question: should there be non-racial Realm of Thought magic, like there is Realm of Magic magic? Thought Magic I think should stay, obviously, and be a generic, true-magic-like power which involves the ability to actually enter the Realm of Thought.  Should there be a Realm of Thought equivalent to arcane magic, like Psionics?  If so, what should it be like? 

Realm of Taelgar: 

Magics based on or associated with the Realm of Taelgar: 

Prophecy/Dreamworld Magic 

Names 

Religious/Spirit Magic 

Dreamworld and Prophecy:  I think Dreamworld/Prophecy magic makes more sense as part of Taelgar than part of The Realm of Thought, as it is intimately Taelgar related.  I am imagining the Dreamworld as an echo of the past and future of Taelgar, imposed upon a shadow of the present.  Thus prophecy would function by a strong connection to the dreamworld somehow, whether through dreams themselves or some other means.   

Names:  The best way I can think of to fit the idea of true names into Taelgar, and a way that I think works well, is this.  Names are representations of the connections between a powerful magic user and its source of power.  To know someone's name is to have some control over their access to power, and in some cases even control over them.  At least while alive.  This ties into religious magic as follows.      

Religious magic:  Religious magic comes in two varieties: spontaneous divine favor and ceremonial spirit magic.  In the first instance, you have a special relationship with a particular demi-god, saint, or something.  You can call upon them to do something for you, much the way Aerin called upon Vortishaal.  In the second instance, you know the names of some spirits, demi-gods, etc  (note that saints, demi-gods, and Araht/Melchior tend to have many, many different names of varying levels of power).  You can command the powers they have access to through those names with the proper rituals and ceremonies.  

A few closing thoughts: 

First, there are variety of different kinds of more bizarre magic, associated with the rarer and more bizarre races, like faeries and giants. 

Second, the way I've got things set up now, there are a huge variety of different kinds of magic.  There are some advantages to this.  First, it is realistic, in the sense that in the real world, there is not one unified kind of magic, but rather a huge variety of different occult and magical practices.  The magic in Taelgar now represents many of these different things: from ESP to kabbala to demonology to ritual spellcasting, among other things.  Second, it creates diversity and challenge for the PCs, because they cannot just assume that the next wizard they meet will be just like the last one.  Finally, if done right, it makes things unique and very interesting.  However, there are also disadvantages.  Lots of different magic requires lots of effort to create good rules for them all, so that they all seem different.  Second, it could make the world seem disjointed, with too many things that don't fit together.  In my opinion, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, but I'd like to hear what you think about all this. 

** Question: Is the level of variety in magic good or bad – especially in regards to the different kinds of Realm of Taelgar magic? 

Races: 

Overview: Basically, there are three classes of races: Firstborn races, rare/mystical races, and non-Firstborn divine creations.  The first and third classes, of course, would be created directly by the Deity.  The second class could be created in a variety of ways.  They could be manifestations of a particular Realm, created by dragon magic, created by saints/demi-gods, or perhaps even in some stranger way. 

The Firstborn Races (in order of creation): 

Elves, Ogre, Dwarves, Lizardmen, Halflings, Kenku 

The non-Firstborn Divine races: 

Humans and hobgoblins, created in between Halflings and Kenku.  These two races are the only ones with a large enough population to evolve into a variety of different ethnicities, with no tie to a Firstborn to limit them. 

Note: Tayledras, in a certain sense, fall into this category.  The do not have a firstborn, although they do share some of the powers derived from the Elven firstborn.  They are a magical race, and are essentially half-elves, in that they have some of the advantages of elves, and some of the advantages of humans.   

Other races: 

Giants and Faeries: These races are both manifestations of the Realm of Taelgar.  They were  

never created purposefully, but came into being with the Realm. 

Eldrake:  This race is a twisted, corrupted manifestation of the Realm of Magic, a byproduct of  

that Realm. 

Liontaurs:  A race created by a dragon, or perhaps a demi-god, living in the deserts of Taelgar. 

Eldars:  This race is a manifestation of the Realm of the Void. 

Other ideas could include: underwater races such as mermen/mermaids (perhaps living in the shoals of Shontu), some form of leprechaun or other, not quite so fey faeries…..feel free to add more. 

Dwarves:   

Physical Description:  Dwarves are short and stocky, averaging four to four and a half feet, and rarely growing taller than five and a half, but often fifty or more pounds heavier than humans of equal height, most of it muscle.  They have ruddy complexions, generally dark or red hair, and dark eyes.  Dwarven males grow long beards, which they braid with intricate ribbons.  As dwarves age, their hair, including their beards, begin to gray and turn white, and their faces acquire deep wrinkles, especially around the eyes.  Dwarven skin is often very thick and callused, and is usually brown or tan in color. 

Dwarves are stubborn, slow to anger, and brave, sometimes to the point of foolhardiness.  The live underground in huge tunnel systems, and are skilled craftsmen.  Dwarves tend to be suspicious and tight lipped those who are not their friends, and tend to make friends slowly, but for life.  Dwarves have a highly developed sense of honor and honesty, and will never betray a friend or their race/clan/caste/family.  Dwarven society is organized around the caste, clan and family, and is rigidly hierarchical and structured.  A dwarf’s place in society is structured by his caste.  The seven castes are based on the seven firstborn, and are: Rune-Caster, Ruler, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, Farmer. 

Dwarves belief that they are a living part of the mountains: they are a crucial part of the life cycle of mountains and mountains form a crucial part of their spiritual existence.  The most sacred site in Dwarven religion is the Heart of the Mountain, the incarnation of the mountains themselves.  The ritual that leads to the selection of the caste of a young Dwarf, occurring at the age of physical maturity (around 25) but before the age of majority (36), involves a journey to find the Heart of the Mountain.  There are no maps, and few people find it in the same place, but all dwarves find it eventually, after wandering through the passages of their people and the natural passages beneath the mountains.  The Heart of the Mountain is a massive hall, formed in the shape of a ribcage, pulsating and changing so that no description is ever the same.  It is the incarnation of the stone itself, the place where the mountains are alive.  In the center of the chamber lies a pool of water, eternally still.  When dwarves finds the chamber seeking their caste, they see in the water a reflection of the moment of their death, learning their caste in that moment.  At death, dwarves are returned to the Heart of the Mountain and their name is carved upon the walls of the chamber, to live in the mountains in perpetuity.   

In game terms, dwarves have the following racial package: 

Attributes: ST +1, HT +2, Extra Fatigue +4 (only good for non-magical uses) 

Life span: Aging starts at 150 years, accelerates at 210 years and again at 270 years.  Dwarves have the racial advantage of Longevity (aging rolls fail only a 17 or 18).  Dwarves reach physical maturity at around age 25, and become full adults at the age of 36, after finding their caste and receiving training.   

Advantages: Dwarves have the racial advantages of Extra Encumbrance (CI55), High Pain Threshold (B20) and Underground Sense (includes Acute Hearing +2, and a modified form of night vision that allows dwarves to see somewhat better than normal utilizing the flickering and sometimes dim light of the underground) 

Disadvantages: Because of their short legs, dwarves have Reduced Move (1 level).  Dwarves are also scrupulously honest in following their code of law: no dwarf will willing break a dwarven law, whether or not they are in the dwarven kingdom.  This is a modified form of honesty (B33) – it never gives the dwarves a reaction bonus, but it doesn’t require them to follow the law of the land, just their own law.  Finally, dwarves have a duty and a sense of duty to their clan, caste, and race.  In the rare situations where one of those groups needs the full support of all its members, dwarves are honor bound to answer the call.  In other instances, dwarves act as those they had a sense of duty to those groups.  Dwarves also have three racial quirks: they tend to dislike open spaces, especially flat plains or open bodies of water (mountain valleys are fine); they are caste-bound and have restricted options based on their caste; and they will never shave their beards unless shamed. 

It costs 50 points to play a Dwarf, and  you must also take a caste package (Rune-Caster, Ruler, Priest, Traveler, Warrior, Farmer, Stoneworker).    

Lizardmen:   

Physical Description: Lizardmen stand an average of six feet tall with a slightly forward 

crouching stance, to balance a three foot long tail.  They are finely scaled and have a perpetual glistening appearance.  If the sun catches a lizardman just as he emerges from the water into early morning swamp mist, the arrangement of scales along his spine creates a prism effect, 

scattering tiny rainbows about him.  Infants are born a translucent pale blue, with gills that disappear as limbs sprout and the scales grow over the course of a few weeks.  Youths are a vibrant blue green, often with streaks of a greenish brown, or, very rarely, brilliant blue marks about the face.  Females are slightly larger as youths, and have markings about the face and neck that shift from deep blue to pale blue to a purplish black according to mood and metabolic state.  For the large part of their lives, though, most lizardmen are a dull green streaked with brown.  Extremely aged lizardmen, especially the elders, develop a uniformly light blue or light blue green coloration and don't glisten as though wet- though in moments of insight, they seem to sparkle a bit and, on very rare occasions, seem ever so slightly transparent to direct sunlight. 

Lizardmen are very connected to nature, the elements and cycles of life, the seasons, and the naturalness and wholesomeness of their swamps.  Time, for lizardmen, does not progress linearly but rather moves cyclically through the years.  While they are not pacifists, they will rarely provoke fights, and never lose control of their tempers in a violent way.  They believe very strongly in the circular nature of life, and feel that unjust deeds will be met in turn, giving them a strong sense of fairness and honor.  They also believe in the preciousness of life, despite their long life spans, and see hurt, pain, and suffering as necessary evils at best.  Many lizardmen find their calling as healers.  There are a few who take to a life of war, but never without reservation and doubt, and never with enjoyment.  These few recognize that the safety and well being of their race depends on the ability to defend themselves, but strive not to become too comfortable with a life of killing and destruction, however necessary it may seem.   

Lizardmen are strongly connected to the spirits of their ancestors, through the Realm of Thought.  Much of lizardmen religion and magic is based upon this connection.  While they do not often venerate the Deity in any incarnation, they do venerate their ancestors, and have a thriving culture of ancestor worship.  They believe that the spirits of their ancestors, especially those who were powerful shamans and spell casters, can protect them and watch over them.  All lizardman magic is based upon the ability to communicate with these spirits and convince them to do as you wish them to.  While much of this magic is utilized for healing, gathering knowledge, and other peaceful exploits, there are some powerful shamans who can utilize their contacts with their ancestors to any aims, and some warriors who use the contact with their ancestors to shield them in combat.  

In game terms, lizardmen have the following racial package: 

Attributes: ST +1, HT +1 

Life span:  Aging begins at 150 for Lizardmen, and aging rolls increase in frequency at 210 and again at 270 years.  Only the very lucky lizardmen live beyond 300 years, and most die in the middle of their third century.  Lizardmen reach maturity at around the age of 35-36.  The first 10 years of their life are spent as amphibious young, and they develop into their adult form, although not their adult size, between the ages of 10-14.   

Advantages:  Lizardmen have the racial advantages of Amphibious (CI49) and Gills (CI56), representing their ability to function equally well under water as on land.  Because of their osmotic balance, they cannot survive in salt water for long, and they cannot extract oxygen from it.  Because of their tough hides, lizardmen gain DR +2. 

Disadvantages:  Most lizardmen have the disadvantage of Pacifism: Self Defense Only.  They will not attack unless their life or the lives of other lizardmen are in danger.  Although some part of this disadvantage reflects the natural tendencies towards peacefulness of the race, a large part of it reflects a mystical inability to strike the first blow.  However, there are a few lizardmen who do not have this disadvantage, and instead have a strong Sense of Duty to the lizardman race, which can sometimes function as a supernatural Duty to the Ancestors.  It is these lizardmen who typically become the warriors of the tribes.  A PC lizardman may pick which disadvantage he or she wants to take, although note that the Sense of Duty is usually obtained on a spirit quest through contact with the spirits of the Ancestors, and so the PC choosing this option should develop the particular circumstances under which they received this Sense of Duty, and may select to take an additional Duty disadvantage towards the Lizardmen Ancestors (frequency 9 or less, worth –5 points, doesn’t count towards the –40 point disadvantage limit for starting characters).  All lizardmen have an increased susceptibilty to dry weather, especially hot and dry weather.  This is typically reflected in increased water needs, 2-3 times the needs of an average human, which can become a particular burden in very dry places like deserts.  Finally, all lizardmen have the racial quirk: uncomfortable away from swamps, rivers, or similar terrain.  Finally, any disadvantage that involves loss of temper, especially in combat situations, or any kind of bloodlust or desire for/enjoyment of violence costs two to three times as much for a lizardman (the extra does not count against the –40 disadvantage limit), to reflect the negative reputation among lizardmen such disadvantages give, and also the fact that such disadvantages typically involve extra penalties when succumbed to, such as flashbacks, voices, shakes, or depression.   

It costs 40 points to play a lizardmen.

Religion: 

Overview:   The "truth" of Araht/Melchior can be interpreted in several different ways.  The most common, in Chardon and Sembara, is a version that claims Araht and Melchior are brothers, who are necessary opposites to maintain the balance of the universe.  There are also "unitarian" sects in these countries that may or may not be seen as acceptable.  In Dunmar, the common belief is a trinity --Araht and Melchior are still brothers, but they have a mother or a sister, not sure which, some feminine deity as the third part of a trinity.  In other places, there may be different names, or the perception of four interrelated deities.  This is, I think, a good way to allow for religious diversity and yet keep everything tied to Araht/Melchior somehow.  Additionally, there are many demigods that are worshipped by various cults.  These are the solution to the problem of aspects, and are perhaps somewhat equivalent to Catholic saints (or perhaps Buddhist saints).  They either come into existence by the will of Araht/Melchior, or they come into existence by the will or the worshippers, or perhaps both.  This still needs to be resolved, but they do exist.  How cults are treated depends on the culture and the society.  Note, additionally, that there is no central religious authority or anything, so that rituals and ceremonies may differ, perhaps even dramatically, between Sembara, Chardon, and other places -- despite being nominally part of the same religion.  The actual structure of the priesthood could vary from region to region.  However, I think for the most part the religion should not be particularly evangelical.   

Finally, a note about the afterlife (for humans -- for other races, under their descriptions).  I had an idea, where the ultimate reward of a good life is seen as final freedom, which is glorified.  Those who did not life a good life could be trapped in Taelgar, or in some shadow realm of Taelgar, a sort of "Land of the Dead," until they appeased their crimes or found their way out.  Something along those lines -- do you like what I'm getting at or not? 

Another random thought: how about this for dividing the non-physical aspects of individuals (souls, spirits, etc).  Everybody has a soul, a spirit, and an essence.  The soul is the spiritual essence, the part of the individual that is tied to the Realm of the Divine.  The spirit is the mental essence, the part of the individual that is manifest on the Realm of Thought.  The essence is the physical essence of the individual, that is manifest in the Realm of Taelgar.  What do you think?

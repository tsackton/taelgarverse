Sembian army details: 

The core of the Sembian army is built around 7,500 regular troops, of which 5,000 are on full time active duty.  The majority of the full time soldiers man the wall, although about 1,000 of them are stationed around the country in various castles.  The other 2,500 regular troops spend one week a month on active duty.   

In addition to the regular army, Sembia has a reserve army of 13,500 troops.  These are mostly peasant levies that train during the winter for two weeks.  They are issued decent equipment, and generally have some skill at their weapons, making them better troops than regular peasant levies.   

The levies needed for full war footing come in two types.  There are about 1,000 landed knights, who can be summoned in times of need to fight as cavalry in the Sembian army.  In addition to these levies, peasants can be levied to fight as irregulars.  Sembia can summon large numbers of them when in real need, but they are not the best soldiers in the army.

crouching stance, to balance a three foot long tail.  They are finely
scaled and have a perpetual glistening appearance.  If the sun catches a
lizardman just as he emerges from the water into early morning swamp mist,
the arrangement of scales along his spine creates a prism effect,
scattering tiny rainbows about him.  Infants are born a translucent pale
blue, with gills that disappear as limbs sprout and the scales grow over
the course of a few weeks.  Youths are a vibrant blue green, often with
streaks of a greenish brown, or, very rarely, brilliant blue marks about
the face.  Females are slightly larger as youths, and have markings about
about the face and neck that shift from deep blue to pale blue to a
purplish black according to mood and metabolic state.  For the large part
of their lives, though, most lizardmen are a dull green streaked with
brown.  Extremely aged lizardmen, especially the elders, develop a
uniformly light blue or light blue green coloration and don't glisten as
though wet- though in moments of insight, they seem to sparkle a bit and,
on very rare occaions, seem ever so slightly transparent to direct sunlight.

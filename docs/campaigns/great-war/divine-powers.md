There are only two true gods of Taelgar, Eru and Melkor.  They are worshipped in various forms and incarnations in all cultures, among all races.  In addition to the true gods, there are many divine “aspects.”  Most are rarely worshipped, but a few have obtained some degree of popularity among certain circles.  Despite the fact that all races and cultures worship the same gods, they all have their own versions of the cosmology of Taelgar, none of which quite match what really happened.  

Eru and Melkor 

Origins: Eru and Melkor are brothers.  They are finite deities (p. R23), representing creation and destruction respectively.  They were there before Taelgar existed, before anything but the plane of magic and the gray column existed.  Where they originally came from is not known by any humanoid culture on Taelgar.  They came from a precursor civilization that had evolved to a transcendent state, and was moving on to other realities.  They left the brothers in charge of this dimension.   

Attributes:  Eru and Melkor resemble archetype deities (p. R24), with Eru representing creation and Melkor representing destruction.  However, they are much more than that.  They are complex beings with complex, often incomprehensible personalities and motives.  Together they form the balance of the universe; the necessary conflict between life and death, between creation and destruction, between good and evil.   

Power:  Eru and Melkor have vast power, but they are neither omnipotent nor omniscient.  Directly, they have no physical power in realms other than their personal domains.  However, acting through avatars and aspects they can wield great influence.  For the most part, they do not use it though.  Only in extreme circumstances will either Melkor or Eru actively take a hand in the daily happenings in Taelgar.  To do so would violate the inherent balance of the universe, and in extreme circumstances could threaten its very existence.   

Physical Form:  These gods have no physical form, as trying to view there incredible complexity and power is not possible for the mortal mind.  Their aspects and avatars, however, have varying physical forms based on their personal natures.   

Domiciles: Eru and Melkor exist solely in their personal realms, represented in conceptual maps of the planes by the upper and lower hemispheres respectively.  These planes are not normally reachable by living mortals, although in special circumstances they can be accessed.  However, to enter the domain of a god is to give up any ability to return to the mortal world.  The two realms, that of the immortals and that of the mortals, are almost completely disconnected from each other, linked only by the gray column and the universal rules that govern all existence. 

Immortality and Death:  Eru and Melkor are essentially immortal – they will die only when the fabric of the multiverse is unraveled.  Their fate and the fate of the rest of existence are inevitably linked and cannot be separated.

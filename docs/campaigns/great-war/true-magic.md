{title: True Magic}
---


True magic is magic that creates its effects by drawing energy directly from the plane of Magic in whatever form is desired.  Energy exists on the plane of Magic in ten broad subtypes: life, death, soul, body, mind, magic, earth, air, fire, and water.  These types of energy manifest themselves on our plane as currents or weaves of energy.  All these weaves of energy also have subweaves, which represent a more detailed breakdown of what the energy does.  Fire, for example, might have subweaves of heat or of flame.  The subweaves for a particular type of energy are not permanently fixed; all they really are is a more detailed understanding of what makes up the weave.   

Creating weaves:  To create a weave, a mage must decide what effect he intends to create and what weaves he is going to use to do it.  The basic process of creating a weave is handled as a skill roll, with several modifiers: 

Difficulty:  The GM assigns a difficulty to the spell, based on the number of types of energy needed, the degree to which the result requires altering the fabric of reality, and the familiarity of the caster with it, among other things.  The following chart shows the effects of difficulty on skill: 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Difficulty Level|Skill Adjustment|
|Simple|+4|
|Easy|+2|
|Average|+0|
|Hard|-2|
|Foolish|-4|

Other modifiers: 

+1 per 3 points of fatigue used 

+1 per quadrupling of time needed (base time 1 second); max. +4 

-1 per weave being maintained at the time 

-1 for instantaneous casting (base time 1 second) 

Weave Strength:  Once a weave is created, its strength must be determined.  The strength of a weave is equal to Raw Power of the weave’s creator + the amount the roll to create the weave was made by + the amount of fatigue spent specifically for this purpose.  Fatigue used to increase skill does not count for weave strength.  If a weave is “tied-off,” its strength is reduced by 1/3, and it loses strength at a rate of one point per day.

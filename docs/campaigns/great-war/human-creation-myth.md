{title: Human Creation Myth}

In the beginning, there was a void (the Center).  Two brothers, Eru and Melkor dwelt there for time uncounted, exploring and growing in power.  Eventually, they discovered a new power, a power of the binding and unbinding of reality.  Drawing from the center of this power (the plane of Magic), they discovered how to create, and destroy.   

Eru, in his eagerness to grow, began to create, and what he made was beautiful.  Melkor saw what his brother was doing, and was jealous of his brother’s creativity.  But when he tried himself, he found that he could create nothing of beauty, being tainted by jealousy for his brother.  In that instant, he decided his brother was a better person than him, and so what could he do but be evil?  All of Eru’s offers of reconciliation fell on deaf ears.   

In time, Eru grew in his strength, and became daring.  Mustering all his power and courage, he began to sing, and with his song the earth was born.  It was given the name Taelgar.  Deciding that his creation needed a people to give it life and color, he created the elves.  He made them friends with the trees and the flowers, the birds and the fish, even the lowly insects.  But nothing could escape Melkor’s influence, especially not something created by his truest brother.  So the elves became aloof and distrustful of the outside world.   

After having created a people to populate the world, and finding them only living in the forests, Eru decided he must create more.  From the stone of the highest mountains, the chill air and snow, he molded the ogre, strong and brave and wise.  Yet they too were caught by Melkor, and made to love their mountains too much.  Rarely, if ever, did the ogre come down from their lofty peaks to grace the world of man. 

So Eru created another race, a race dwelling under the mountains.  If civilization could not flourish throughout the land, why not in the mountains?  The dwarves were made from the roots of the earth, stoic and enduring.  The dwarves, finally, were a race that could develop a great civilization, albeit under the mountains.  They were numerous and prosperous, honorable and courageous.  Yet even they could not escape Melkor’s evil.  He made them too honorable, so honorable that the race was sundered.  Over half the race, including a disproportionate number of females, left because they could not accept inter-dwarven war.  As far as anyone knows, they all disappeared.  Ironically, soon after that the dwarves established themselves as one kingdom under a high king. 

After the dwarves, who were made in the same mold as the elves and ogre failed to spread throughout Taelgar, Eru began experimenting with other races.  He created the lizard men, a peaceful race of healers, hoping they could civilize the world.  But they lacked the ambition and drive to expand.  He created the halflings, making them curious enough to travel, but Melkor twisted it the other direction, so they ended up with no homeland, and no desire to settle down, and so took to the seas. 

Finally, Eru created the humans.  They were different from all the races that had come before.  They were far more diverse and adaptable.  They were shorter lived, but more ambitious and daring than the previous races.  However, they were not as pure.  As they began to grow and spread, their impurity began to show.  Some humans were not friendly, they were jealous.  Some were humble, but just as many were arrogant.  But in their adaptability, they prospered, and became the race of Taelgar.   

Details: 

Before the beginning:  A great civilization was ending.  They had dwelt on the plane of magic, and had great powers of song, powers beyond mortals imagination.  The last of them was father to Eru and Melkor, and placed them in slumber in the protection of the Center.  The civilization was collapsing because magic was becoming tainted from overuse.  Eru and Melkor were protected in the center, and so survived to start a new multiverse.  

Other races:  Hobgoblins, orcs (and goblins), giants, kobolds, mind flayers, and bullywugs were created by Melkor, and softened by Eru.  Giants are the ones that ended up like humans – some good, some evil, some in between.  Dragons are remnants of the old civilization, like Eru and Melkor.  They are less powerful than those two, however.

Rohan- 

Rohan is in utter chaos.  It exists as a country in name only.  Villages have become essentially independent.  A significant percentage of the population has formed militias, some riding north to fight hobgoblins, some riding south to the capital, others becoming essentially vigilante groups.  The rangers have been trying to lead the militias north or south, and maintain some semblance of organization.  They have had limited success in maintaining organization, but have managed to direct most of the bands to decent locations.  In the north, a army of 10,000 militia troops and 2,000 regular army troops in hunting hobgoblins, with 100 rangers as scouts and support personnel.  In the capital, the situation is much worse.  No one seems to be capable enough to lead the people, so general chaos has ensued.  Starvation and disease have become a real problem in the city.  The army has been attempting a general muster, with very little success.  Many refugees fleeing from the eastern plague infected towns have fled to the capital.  Most of the people there are desperate. 

Sembia- 

Unlike Rohan, the Sembian morale is high.  Troops, although outmatched, are maintaining a hope of victory.  However, few of them know the full numbers of troops they face.  In the pass, an army of 40,000 hobgoblins is attacking, with up to 15,000 reinforcements on their way to the pass.  No one knows the exact number of troops in Vasa, but best estimates are at least 50,000 undead. 

Information - Sembian military 

Best guess estimates as to enemy troops are as follows: 

* 40,000 hobgoblins currently in the pass 
* 10,000 hobgoblin reinforcements three days journey from the pass 
* 50,000 undead troops marching south in Vasa, three days north from the Wall 

Current military strategy is as follows: 

In the pass, the Sembian army has a huge advantage.  Not only are they defending their homes, but they know the territory.  Odds in the pass are only 2 to 1 in favor of the enemy, so with a little skill and luck we should be able to hold them off.  They have no siege weapons, and we can maintain a constant barrage of artillery.  Also, our troops are well supplied and have a strong fortress to fall back on; they have neither.  On the wall we have a slightly greater problem.  Recommend sending all available peasant levies north, not west.  Also, increase the number of the artillery on the wall.  It is unlikely the enemies will have any artillery, and regardless it will have limited effect against the wall.  As long as the wall is not breached, we will be okay to the north.  If at all possible, reinforcements from Rohan or Chardon would be greatly appreciated, but neither country seems likely to have troops to spare anytime soon.  There is not much that we can do but try to hold our positions and recruit as many levies as possible.

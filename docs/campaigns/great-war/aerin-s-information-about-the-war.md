Pandar- 

A large volcano in the north of Pandar, Mt. Baal, has started smoking.  The significance is unclear.  The volcanoes along the southern border are all erupting regularly, creating a near impassable wall.  Also, a hobgoblin and human army about 40,000 strong is massing in southern Pandar.  About ten miles out of the main city of Pandar, something looking like a large shimmering one-way mirror has appeared.  Its exact size is unknown, but it is large enough to be seen by Kenku in high overflights of the country. 

Volkrad- 

The hobgoblin army stationed here has grown to 40,000.  They appear to be eating mostly refugees that have been rounded up, and the food stores of the city.  A detachment of about 10,000 is currently marching towards the past, presumably as reinforcements. 

Amn- 

Complete chaos reigns in Amn.  A many sided civil war has broken loose.  Food shortages abound, and people are dying by the thousands.  Most refugees who manage to flee the country are caught by hobgoblin patrols, and thrown in the cookpots. 

Voonlar- 

About 100,000 humans have holed up here, with maybe half in fighting condition.  So far no hobgoblins have attacked them, but they are effectively under siege unless magic could be used to get them out. 

Vasa- 

Nothing appears to be left in a two mile diameter around the city.  In the rest of the country, there appears to be general unrest.  The news of the temporary disablement of death of the witch-king has spread fast, and a long oppressed population is rising up.  The human military has split into factions, each controlling some sections of the country.  However, the undead army is still marching steadily south - a force that has grown to about 100,000.  If they continue at their current rate, they will reach the wall in one day’s time. 

Damara- 

Conscriptions of humans have been continuing, apparently to supply the army now in Cormyr.  Apparently no news from Vasa has reached this country.  A force of about 10,000 conscripts is marching south to Cormyr, heavily guarded by Vasan security troops. 

Cormyr- 

The country has been ravaged by the Vasan army.  Almost no cities are unburned, and refugees are being rounded up and sent to work camps building ships on the Cormyr coast.  The army that took Cormyr numbers about 15,000 currently, with 15 ships battle ready, and more being turned out every day.  They appear in no hurry to attack Sembia or any other country. 

Sembia- 

Sembia is currently fighting a battle in the pass, with an army of about 18,000.  They are fighting an army of at least 40,000 hobgoblins.  They have lost the past two skirmishes, suffering light casualties.  However, tonight the Kenku firebombing is planned to start, which should turn the tide of that battle.  In the north, an army of 18,000 is stationed on the wall, with 2,000 more in peasant levies marching north.  The reinforcements should arrive within the week.  The Sembian navy is also massing; the standing navy of 18 ships is battle ready, and merchant ships are being recruited.  Only 5 merchant ships have been outfitted so far, but hopeful another 7-10 can be found. 

Chardon- 

The Chardon Guard has been called up, giving the city and its surrounding land a total force of 8,000.  The Academy has been on battle footing, as has the navy.  Fifteen ships are sailing upriver, and another twelve are stationed in the harbor, in case of a siege.   

Rohan- 

Utter chaos.  With the king no longer in control, and the Plague encroaching on the eastern border, the Rohirrim are struggling to find someone to blame.  Riots have broken out, and lynch mobs have become a problem, preying on unpopular neighbors.  The army is trying to initiate a general muster, but there is so much panic.  A force of 10,00 cavalry is battle ready, but it has nowhere to go. 

Other information- 

The horse presumed to be alive and under the mountains.  Thirty-two kenku died investigating a cave entrance that led deep underground, and had signs that a horse had passed that way.  In a place where no horses would normally go, this is a fairly strong lead. 

Information - Mockers 

Pandar- 

Pandar is closed to Mockers, and a very dangerous place to try to get information about.  Some has leaked out, however.  Cha’mutte is working on a new project that his subordinates boast will guarantee him victory.  It is likely it has something to do with a large army he is massing is southern Pandar.  How he plans to get them out of Pandar is a mystery, as the volcanoes are creating a near impassable wall to the south. 

Volkrad- 

Also a place where few Mockers dare go these days.  However, a lot of information has been gleaned from the few refugees who survived.  First of all, the hobgoblin army there is growing.  Best estimates place it at between 40,000 and 50,000.  Apparently a significant portion of the hobgoblin’s food comes from refugees who are killed and eaten.  Only about 10% of the refugees who try to leave make it out; presumably magic of some sort is being used to track them.    

Amn- 

The civil war has completely deteriorated.  The false mockers have holed up in the capital, and have in under their control, for the most part.  At least three other factions have sprung up in the fighting, however.  A merchants guild composed of very shady merchants is trying to win control of the government, or at the very least find a way to profit from the chaos.  A plant in their organization says they are primarily interested in taking the treasury.  Another faction is apparently a Pandar plant.  They will not accept new members, and seem to be primarily concerned with keeping the chaos around for as long as possible.  Finally, some hobgoblins have joined in the fray, taking most of the eastern cities.  Whether they are deserters from the army, independents, or a second plant from Pandar is unclear, but they are primarily concerned with making money and capturing refugees.  Most citizens who are not affiliated with one of these groups have fled, or tried to.  However, like Volkrad the escape rate is only about 10%.  

Voonlar- 

Voonlar is safe for the moment, maybe.  They have severe overcrowding problems, and are losing between 20 and 100 men per day to attrition.  Although they are not technically besieged, no refugee has successfully fled the city.  There is a faction arguing to leave the young, old, and weak behind and flee downriver as a massive group, guaranteeing some will make it.  Although they have little popular support, their appeal seems to be gaining as conditions worsen.  Information from here is spotty at best, and nothing new has been received for two days. 

Vasa- 

The only Mockers in Vasa were in the capital; they appear to be dead. 

Damara- 

Although it is not apparent from the outside, the Underground has been very active.  They received news about the witch-king less than a day ago, but already they have been spreading rumors and whispering among themselves.  A member of the organization says they plan to launch a massive revolution in about two weeks time, after they are sure of having enough support, and after a large percentage of the Damaran security troops have left guarding conscript units.  With luck, they will be able to overthrow the government, and attack Cormyr from the north, by surprise.   

Cormyr- 

The landscape has been destroyed, and all the larger cities have been destroyed.  The attacking army fought a war of destruction; very little has been left undamaged.  As of now, no organized resistance has formed.  Most people are too busy trying to find food and shelter to worry about freeing themselves from oppression.  Also, any who are suspected of speaking out are thrown in work camps building ships for an invasion of Sembia.  A plant in the army says that the fleet will not launch until they have thirty ships, which will be in about two weeks.  Also, the army appears to have a secret weapon of some sort, involving fire.  All the generals and high officers and very confident about victory, and keep mentioning a hidden advantage. 

Sembia- 

Sembia is currently fighting a battle in the pass, with an army of about 18,000.  They are fighting an army of at least 40,000 hobgoblins.  They have lost the past two skirmishes, suffering light casualties.  In the north, an army of 18,000 is stationed on the wall, with 2,000 more in peasant levies marching north.  The reinforcements should arrive within the week.  The Sembian navy is also massing; the standing navy of 18 ships is battle ready, and merchant ships are being recruited.  Only 5 merchant ships have been outfitted so far, but hopeful another 7-10 can be found.  Morale in general is very high, despite early losses.  So far nothing supernatural has appeared on the other side, encouraging the forces of Sembia that they may yet win this battle.  However, in the palace the feeling is more grim.  They know how many enemies there really are out there, and the unlikelyhood of any aid from other countries.   

Chardon- 

The Chardon Guard has been summoned, as has the Chardon Marines.  Chardon is gearing for full battle.  The Academy has been called to action, and they are forming units of four battle mages.  At least 20 such units have been created.  Total forces number 8,000 soldiers, 6,000 marines, 32 ships (including 6 full dreadnoughts), and 80 mages.  The council has been working the people into a frenzy, describing atrocities committed by the other side, and dehumanizing the humans on the other side through association with hobgoblins.  The city is prepared to go to almost any length to kill them if they come close.  A lot fewer people are willing to endanger Chardonians to protect other countries however, particularly because the Chardon military is so small, and will be overtaxed to defend Chardon alone.  However, 5 detachments of mages are preparing to go to Sembia to help with the pass battle.   

Rohan- 

Rohan has deteriorated severely since the king went insane.  Law has almost entirely broken down, with villages becoming virtually autonomous, part of Rohan in name only.  Rohan currency is still accepted everywhere, but no one has paid any taxes, magistrates are no longer recognized as the final word of the law, and the military no longer has any authority.  The people are in a panic, with no where to turn.  All over Rohan militias are springing up.  Some have headed north to hunt hobgoblins, some have turned south to the capital, and others have become roving bands of vigilantes.  The capital is in a state of complete disarray.  There is famine and disease in the close quarters of the capital.  The army has been trying to call a general muster, but to no avail.  The people are looking for a strong leader to step in and tell them what to do, but the king was so capable before his incapacitation that no one else had the opportunity to develop the necessary skills to lead the kingdom.

Dragons: 

Dragons are ancient beings, from before Time began.  Like foci, it is assumed that they cannot be created.  The population of dragons is steadily, if slowly, declining.  Because they don’t breed, there are no young dragons.  Every dragon currently in existence has been alive since the beginning of Time.  This gives them a unique perspective and relationship with the rest of the world.   

Almost all dragons see the world of Taelgar as something too insignificant to deal with.  They exist on a higher level; they are not bound to one particular dimension.  For the most part, dragons are little understood, reclusive, and concerned with deeper things than the doings of the mundane.  However, a few dragons have taken a more involved role (the Traveler and Cha’mutte are two obvious examples), and although little is known about the relationship between the involved dragons and the reclusive ones, a fair amount is known about the involved dragons themselves. 

Dragons (meaning all the involved dragons from now on) are very mysterious, to say the least.  Very few people have actually had conversations (never more than ten per age), and even fewer have recorded the conversations they have had.  All told, there are less than twenty books with firsthand information on dragons in them, which leaves very little to study from.  Although there are thousands of books containing second or thirdhand information about dragons, they are for the most part contradictory and unreliable.  However, despite the lack of information, something can be learned about dragons from the few books with first hand information, and from careful analysis of the thousands with somewhat unreliable information.  Many months of study has led to the following conclusions. 

Dragons are very secretive and very subtle.  Only four dragons in recorded history have become directly involved in events on Taelgar (Cha’mutte, the Traveler, and Shayes (yes, he’s a dragon) being the ones still alive.  The fourth was killed at the end of the first age).  The vast majority prefers to use their influence indirectly, often without ever revealing their true identity.  As a race, they dislike contact with outsiders, and generally have to be approached very carefully to avoid sudden death.  There does not appear to be any real racial unity among dragons, as there is among many races.  However, they do seem to keep in contact with each other, and every dragon appears to know every other dragon, often intimately.  However, the ones who get involved in Taelgar seem to stay almost completely separate from the recluses.  Also, it seems that dragons never attack each other directly, no matter what the motivation.  This leads to interesting conflicts between dragons, in which the fighting dragons remain perfectly civil to each other, but their non-dragon allies become engaged in massive wars.  There are apparently rules that detail these conflicts, allowing dragons to determine the winner fairly and without dragon bloodshed.  None of the rules have ever been recorded however, and why dragons fight is completely unknown.   

The relationship between dragons and deities and the relationship between dragons and the firstborn are two of the few things in dragon lore about which a fair amount of solid information exists.  Deities (meaning Eru and Melkor and all their various aspects) came from the same place as dragons, wherever that is, but have much further reaching powers, and are generally more powerful.  The relationship between dragons and deities greatly varies depending on the dragon, as does the relationship between dragons and the firstborn (and thus the created races).  There are three schools of thought among dragons on these issues.   

The first one, of which Cha’mutte is a believer, is that the deities unnecessarily control the firstborn, and the firstborn unnecessarily control the created races.  This control leads to a stifling of development in much the same way that an oppressive government or overprotective parent does.  Therefore, the solution is to remove the oppressive forces, in this case the firstborn and the deities.  Admittedly there may be some potentially negative side effects, but the slate must be wiped clean in order to allow the natural order of things to progress. 

The second school of thought believes that the deities are a positive stabilizing influence, but that the firstborn were a mistake.  The firstborn, by their very existence, force the created races into a particular mold, which they are virtually required to live by.  When they stray from the mold, they become decadent and depressed, as the elves did, but they often have no way to get back on track.  If the firstborn did not exist, the created races would have been free to change and adapt as the non-created races can, and so prosper.  However, the solution cannot be to just kill the firstborn, as that would hurt the races too greatly.  Instead, the solution must be to work with the deities to remove the influence of the firstborn while keeping the races as intact as possible.   

The third school of thought, of which the Traveler is a believer, is that the deities and the firstborn are both positive influences on Taelgar and the created races.  The firstborn give the created races unique advantages which the non-created races do not have, such as racial magic.  Yes, the firstborn force the created races into a particular mold, but that mold is not a bad thing.  That mold gives the races their unique powers, and the abilities that make them perfectly adapted to the particular roles they fill.  And the deities are the ultimate source of the firstborn magic.  The firstborn and the deities, acting in concert, maintain the balance that is necessary to the continued existence of Taelgar.  Without them, that balance would be quick to disappear, and without the balance, Taelgar would be quick to disappear, or at least descend into chaos from which it quite possibly might never recover.  

Relevant excerpts about Cha’mutte: 

And then he started explaining why he had to do what he was doing, despite the cost of life and happiness.  As he talked, I was spellbound by his incredible voice, and I found it very difficult not to agree with him.  What he said was this:  “Freedom, more than anything else, is the most important possession of a race, nation, or individual.  Freedom is what I am fighting for, and although it may be hard to accept the cost, it must be paid, or a far harsher penalty will be suffered in the future.  The firstborn chain you to a personality that is not your own.  They force you to make choices that are not your own.  They remove your free will, and substitute it with their guidance, which in their arrogance they assume is what is best for the whole race.  That is not acceptable.  The price will be high, but we must break the bonds that hold you to a stereotype and cost you your freedom, whatever the cost.  Are you with me?”

He lifted me in his mighty claw, drawing me up until I was gazing into his huge eyes, his red, red, eyes.  I could feel the anger beating down on me, and I, for the first time in many, many years genuinely feared for my life and immortal soul.  Then he said, “What do you know of challenges, puny dwarf?  I could crush you in the palm of my hand without thinking.  But no – that would be too easy, for I know you were sent here by someone else, and I have a better surprise for him.  Go back to him, and tell him I accept.  The third age will be our battle ground, its end our victory condition.  Now go, and forget.”  I do not remember the next fifteen years of my life, or anything that happened three years prior to that incident.   

Firstborn: 

The firstborn are unique powers that embody the soul of the race they represent.  The known firstborn are: 

The sailor, merchant, and wanderer of the Halflings 

Durin and his six brothers of the Dwarves 

The four elemental spirits of the Lizard Men 

The One of the Ogre 

The Unicorn of the Moon and the Ent of the Forest of the Elves 

Firstborn have a unique and poorly understood link to the rest of their race.  They are definitely connected in some fashion, as the firstborn are the ones that provide their race with access to racial magic (detailed later).  They also have subtler affects on their race.  The members of the race tend to behave similar to their firstborn, although it is certainly not a hard and fast rule.  Also, the firstborn have a very poorly understood connection to the consciousnesses of the members of their race.  It is this link that gives created races long, sometimes incredibly long lifespans, and it is this link that allows the firstborn to gather the consciousnesses of their race when a member of the race dies.  The firstborn also allows the members of the race to continue existence after they pass on from Taelgar.  Although it is very poorly understood, it is believed that if the firstborn of a race were to die, the race would loose its racial magic, its long lifespan, any afterlife it might have, and the ability to reproduce, as the firstborn must be alive to create the link to each new member of the race that is born.  Obviously, killing the firstborn would be a devastating blow to the race.   

Deities: 

Deities are very poorly understood, as it is not possible to interact with them on a normal level.  However, a few things are known about them.  First, they created everything in Taelgar, whether directly or indirectly.  The only way something can truly be created is through divine intervention.  Anything created in another fashion will radiate an aura of magic, however faint.  Eru and Melkor are responsible for maintaining the balance between good and evil, death and life that exists on Taelgar.  They are the ones that hold the fabric of Taelgar together.  Like most dragons, they will not get involved in the concerns of Taelgar.  If one of them got involved, the balance they believe so strongly in would be completely disrupted.  Therefore, they will not act to help or hinder anyone or anything on Taelgar.   

However, Eru and Melkor have many aspects that will get involved, if not directly.  Because Eru and Melkor are such supremely powerful beings, they can contain multitudes of less powerful deities, known as aspects.  These aspects consist of combination of parts of Eru and Melkor, and are constantly in flux, depending on worshippers on Taelgar.  Although there are very few churches to particular aspects, when one worships Eru or Melkor, one is not really worshiping a particular deity.  One is actually worshiping the particular aspect that most suites ones needs and desires.  A seaman therefore will actually worship the aspect of Oceans, although he prays to Eru, and a gambler might actually worship the aspect of Luck, though he prays to Eru.  Aspects are the only way Eru and Melkor can influence the world of Taelgar. 

Racial magic: 

Racial magic is like divine magic in that in comes from a highly magical being.  There are five racial magics that have been extensively studied.  All share a couple common traits.  First, they can only be used by members of the race, and the older the member, in general, the more powerful his magic, with the firstborn being the most powerful.  Second, all require training.  Not every member of a race can use their racial magic well or at all. 

The racial magic of the halflings involves communication.  Little is known about its actual workings, as the halflings are very protective of this knowledge, and never write any of it down, but a fair amount is known about its effects.  It allows halflings to function as an information network, as it allows long distance communication between members of the race.  Also, it allows them to eavesdrop on other forms of magical or astral communication.   

The racial magic of the elves is True magic. 

The racial magic of the lizard men involves healing, prophecy and astral plane manipulation.  It is linked to both nature and the spirits of their ancestors. 

Ogre racial magic is battle magic.  The art has been almost lost, but in its full glory it allows a unit of ogre troops to devastate whole armies of normal troops. 

Dwarven racial magic is Runic magic, the art of which has also been almost lost.  It is a craft magic, allowing the dwarves to create incredibly powerful things traced with runes of great power.

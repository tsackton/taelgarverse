{title: The Council}
---


There are nine members of the council, but only three are actively involved in war preparations.  Taelisin, Haldir and Ragnar are helping actively: Taelisin and Haldir in Chardon and Ragnar in Sembia.  The six members not active are the following: 

Alarius: He is somewhere in the far north with his flying castle.  Although not much of a battle mage himself, he has extensive knowledge of dragons which could prove very useful.   

Eldain: He has retreated to his tower on the coast north of Chardon.  He is an expert in the elements, and would prove useful as a front line mage.  However, he is very aloof, and he thinks that interfering in wars of any sort is foolish. 

Kerith: His whereabouts are unknown.  He was always a very mysterious mage; no one knows anything about him. 

Thanos: Another mysterious mage.  He has an estate in Chardon, but has not been there for some time.  A specialist in illusions and dreams.  It is suspected that he lives in the far east. 

Mirryn: One of two females on the council.  A specialist in the mind.  Maintains estates in most of the large cities, and is fairly active in world politics.  However, she has not been seen or heard from in about four months.  It is rumored she has a tower in the wild north, near the High Forest. 

Alyssa: The other female on the council.  Has no particular specialty.  Very reclusive; has no known residencies anywhere near civilization.  Rumored to live on a small island west of Chardon.

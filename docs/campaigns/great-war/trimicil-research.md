In the beginning, there was a void.  Two entities awoke in that void: Eru and Melkor.  Through their magic powers, they created a universe.  (From the standard version of the human’s creation myth.) 

The void they awoke in had three distinct parts.  First, the nullspace, a realm of literally nothing.  It is the symbolic and metaphysical center of the universe.  Second, the truespace, or the realm of power.  From here, the entities drew all their magical energies.  Third, the greyspace, a realm of thought.  It is here that we go when we experience particularly vivid dreams.   

In that void, the elements of which presumably still exist today, these twin entities created three other, distinct spaces.  First, and most important to us, is primespace.  This is the realm on which we exist.  Here, things work the way we expect them to.  Second is whitespace.  This is Eru’s personal domain.  It is to Eru what whitespace is to us.  Finally, the third space created is blackspace.  This is similar to whitespace, but it is Melkor’s personal domain instead of Eru’s.  Obviously, very little non-religious information exists on these two spaces, but we can speculate a little.  [Here Tarnnid rambles for about thirty pages on the meaning of the words white and black, what is meant by a space, and the nature of the universe.  Although fascinating, it does not really pertain to finding Rai.] (From The Musings of Tarnnid, a massive work on cosmology written during the second age by a Hkarian; it is one of the few non-religious sources on cosmology.)  

. . .And when Eru spake thus, the heavens opened, letting the white light of heaven shine through the land, and sickness vanished, famine ceased, and even death paused in its path, for the light of Eru could heal even the dead. . . 

. . .Darian approached, carrying the body of his dead son.  And the doors of the temple swung open, from no earthly impetus, and the columns gleamed with a blinding white light, as if heaven in all its glory had taken up residence in the temple.  Darian was drawn forward, and lo!  When the light died, and he could see again, his son was standing, the light of Eru pulsing in him. . . 

. . .And so Eru spoke, saying thus: “You shall venerate me always, but never pretentiously, for the glory of my name is not to be found in gold and jewels, but in a pure heart.   

And Mordan spoke to the people, saying: “I have been where no man lived, and seen the very heart of His glory, and it is not a place of material wealth.  But oh, the riches there!  You have never been as content and relaxed as I in that place.  So let the word go forth, and let the name of Eru grow in us!”. . . 

. . .The old man, grieving for his lost son, wailed, “But why can we not stay there?  Should we not get as good a fate as the elves?” 

And Mordan replied thusly:  “If we were to dwell forever in Eru’s domain, spend eternity in His bosom, we would grow weary of existence, and wish to end it.  Ours are short, fiery, but quick lives, and we must accept that.”. . .

The Nature of Eru: 

Think of it like this: Eru is not a real God, in the sense most people think of Him.  He is, rather, a manifestation of the good and pure traits of life: companionship, charity, love, even things like lust and mischief.  That He is also the creator of these traits is not particularly relevant.  If all these traits ceased to exist, so would He.  Then again, if he ceased to exist, so would all these traits.  It is a symbiotic relationship of sorts.   

Melkor, on the other hand, is a manifestation of all that is tainted and corrupt.  He turns lust into lechery, mischief into petty cruelty, love into hate, and charity into greedy selfishness.  Now, we all have a little of both Gods in us; I would like to think we have more Eru than Melkor, however.   

(From Lecture XI: The Nature of the Divine, by Larius, a First Great Empire scholar) 

Afterlife: 

Elves: The elves are the only ones with a definite, and permanent afterlife.  When elves die, if they are given a proper burial within a set time, they go live with Eru forever.  If they are not, their spirit is loose, and may either dissipate, or stay tied to the earth forever. 

Dwarves and Ogres: These races do not retain their consciousness after they die, but they do have an afterlife of sorts.  Their souls merge with the mountains.  In certain holy spots, you can almost feel the accumulated wisdom of thousands of years radiating from them. 

Lizard Men: Like dwarves and ogres, the lizard men do not retain their consciousness, but they do become one with nature.  The reason lizard men are such good healers is because they can draw on the spirit-force of their ancestors. 

Halflings and Humans:  When these races die, it is over.  They are gone forever.    

(From various sources, and personal experience) 

Resurrection: 

There are three documented ways to be resurrected: very powerful healing magics within minutes of death, divine intervention, or powerful ancient relics.  In Rai’s case, the first is obviously useless. 

The most commonly documented form of divine intervention is the healing of a holy person’s son/daughter/wife/husband by bringing the body to a temple, after long days of prayer and purification, and begging Eru to help.  This happens nine, possibly ten times (one time it is not clear if the girl is dead or just almost dead) in the Scrolls of the Divine.  

However, it is unlikely to be of any use in bringing back Rai, even if every documented time actually happened.  With no body, there is very little you can do with this method, especially because there are no documented cases of a person being raised by this method of divine intervention without a body. 

The second form of divine intervention is much rarer, and the focus of a lot more study.  Twice in the Scrolls, a saint dies, his body vanishes, and within a week he reappears, alive, and generally much wiser.  The two people this happened to, Darian and Mordan, became major characters in the Scrolls.   

However, the difficulty with this form of resurrection is that it is very fickle.  Unlike his aspects, Eru is not an entity that can be directly communicated with, and He is the only one with the power to alter death.  Since Rai was not a saint, and does not deserve to be a saint, to bring him back with this method would require convincing Eru to make an exception.  And in recorded history, he never has, no matter how much praying was done, or how much was at stake.  Although this method may verge on being possible, it is not the most promising one.

Non-religious resurrection: 

There are no recorded instances of this happening, but there are intriguing possibilities that could work.   

Despite our current advances in the magical fields, and even despite Darius’ recent discovery of true magic, we know very little about magic.  Magic, as we know it, covers only a tiny fraction of what magic used to cover, and even with the addition of true magic, there are significant gaps.  I will use my examination of the circlet Hegard discovered as an example. 

This item is a black circlet, designed to fit about the head of a creature slightly larger than the average man: perhaps a large man, a hobgoblin, or a small ogre.  It is made of metal, but not one I or our metalsmiths have ever seen.  In my careful probe, I discovered it was magical.  That much was obvious.  Yet I couldn’t discover anything more. 

Our magic, and as I gather, true magic, is based around “weaves” of energy, that flow like tiny rivers at our command.  Yet I could detect no weaves at all in this item.  Darius tried, and failed as well.  At my insistence, Darius used one of his favors with Mardraum, and even he could find no weaves.  He told us it was a relic of a long past time, and to leave it alone, for we could do far more harm than good with it.  Now, no one disobeys the advice of a dragon, so we obediently stored it in our vault.  Yet I couldn’t put it out of my mind. 

I forced myself to attempt one unauthorized probe, to see what I could find out.  I’m not sure what I did, but I found myself being drawn into it.  My magic is like a black and white sketch, and from what I heard true magic could be compared to painting in color.  But this, oh this was like an infinitely complex play, complete with light and music.  It was overwhelming, and far deeper than any magic we know.  I must have stood there for hours, for when I next looked up, it was near morn.   

I don’t think I will ever understand the magic that was trapped in that circlet.  But whatever it is, it was far superior to even our best mages, and I can certainly try to understand, and learn. 

(From the journal of Umbar, Darius’ closest friend, and one of the strongest mages of Drankor.) 

Umbar was killed while experimenting with a piece of indestructible oak carved into a mobius strip.  After he died, Darius forbid any further experiments with unknown magic, and any further collection of unknown magic.  He tried to get rid of the six artifacts Drankor then possessed as well.  What follows is a list of the items Drankor had before Umbar died: 

Item: Circlet of black metal, unknown origin 

Powers: Unknown 

Magic Type: Unknown 

Item: Oak mobius strip 

Powers: Indestructible 

Magic Type: Unknown 

Item: Silver dagger blade, with apparently random etchings, as if by acid 

Powers: Sharper than any known sword 

Magic Type: True and unknown 

Item: Crimson shroud, lined with black silk (added); original cloth is of unknown   

         origin 

     Powers: Black silk additions will preserve any body the shroud is placed on 

Magic Type: Arcane and unknown 

Item: Black obsidian staff 

Powers: Weighs virtually nothing 

Magic Type: Unknown 

Item: Intricately sculpted miniature of a temple, done in rose marble.  Inside the  

         temple, a gold tripod holds a piece of unidentifiable crystal shaped like a  

         prism. 

Powers: Unknown 

Magic Type: Unknown 

(From a commonly used biography of Umbar, considered the definitive source.) 

Magic is much like art.  The more colors, the more textures and patterns to choose from, the more options the artist has.  The grander the painting, the more the artist must have had to work with.  Magic is the same.  And thinking about that, we must wonder about the creation of the earth.  Even our most powerful mages could not have come close to creating something so broad.  Yet it is not because they lack the talent, it is because they lack the raw materials.  There must be a more powerful magic, one we do not yet understand or control, or the earth could never have been created.  Some will say it is Eru and Melkor, but I know there is more than just that.  The simple answer rarely tells the full story.

# The Guide to the World of Taelgar

## _153 Fourth Age_

## General Information

#### Overview:

Taelgar is a large, diverse world, high in magic and fantasy. There are many races, and, although humans are the most prominet and populus of the races, they are by no means the only powerful race. Magic is common in certain areas, however, Taelgar is a normal mana world, and only those with the gift of Magery can cast magic spells. The known world spans many hundreds of miles. Beyond it's borders, strange mysteries lurk. To the west, the Endless Sea prevents travel, and to the South, mysterious civilizations loom. The history of Taelgar is a long one: over ten thousand years since the beginning of time. The Third Age has recently ended, bringing with it upheaval and chaos. Order has only recently returned to the land.

#### Solar System:

Taelgar is a spherical planet which orbits a Sun and is set against a fixed sphere of stars. The moon orbits Taelgar, and is proportionally as large as the Earth's moon.

#### Stars:

The stars in the sky of Taelgar are many, and constellations and legends have grown up around the more interesting shapes. Two constetalions of note: The Foxes, which was formed when Beryl Athera was lifted to the heavens by Aru, and the Northern Crown, the center star of which is always in the northern skies, and can be used to tell direction.

#### Calendar:

The human calendar, orginally devised in Hkar, consists of 12 months, January, Febuary, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December, consiting of 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, and 31 days respectively. The months are divided up into weeks of seven days each, consisting of the days, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Furthermore, there are 5 days outside of any month. Three fall at Midwinter, which is between the last day of December and the first day of January. The shortest day of the year falls on the first day of Midwinter. Two extramonthly days fall at Midsummer, between the last of June and the first of July. The longest day of the year is the first day of Midsummer. There are several different yearly numbering schemes which humans use. In Sembara, years are counted from the founding of Sembara. In Chardon, two yearly schemes are used. The first (and most common) counts from the resettling of Chardon after the fall of the First Great Empire. The second, scholarly one, counts from the end of the Third Age. In Dunmar, years are reckoned from the year of the return of the horse. These are the important counts of years. Other smaller nations might count years differently, but generally the scholarly year counted is used in order to make communication possible with others.

Non-human races fall into one of three categories with regards to time: they simply don't need the absolute placing of dates offered by numbering years, and tend to count (when they bother) by relative terms (7 years after the great blizzard, next year, two years before the good harvest), or they have a formal system different from humanity, or they use the human system. Elves, lizardmen, and ogre fall into the first category. Elves are even more extreme then the other two and hardly use the smaller concepts of time at all. A minute to an elf is very different than a minute to a human. Elves have a much longer view of time. Lizardmen and ogre both tend to use the human calendar (although ogre are fluent in dwarven calendars as well) when necessary, and relative times otherwise. Dwarves fall into the second category. Kenku and halflings fall into the third, with the following excepts: Halflings number years from the beginning of their race, and the kenku tribes (before the third age) did the same, although with much less accuracy, and different numbers were common for each tribe. In modern times, kenku use the human system, using scholarly years.

#### Holidays

Although holidays of various nations and cultures tend to vary widely, there are some which are based on ancient traditions, and prevalent throughout human culture.

Midsummer and Midwinter, holidays celebrating the longest and shortest days of the year, are celebrated in most human cultures. The modern incanation of such holidays, which includes bonfires and evergreens at Midwinter and feasting, drunkenness, and freedom at Midsummer derives from the traditions of Ancient Hkar, reenforced by the First Great Empire.

In the spring, it has been the tradition among humans since the days of the First Age to give thanks to Aru, and celebrate the coming of spring. Sometimes this is combined with a celebration of the Awakening of Humanity, sometimes the Awakening is celebrated at a different time, usually also in the springtime. Harvestfest, in it's modern incarnation, derives from the Northerner tradition of celebrating the harvest. It is usually the last three days of October.

Within the last thousand years, the Day of the Dead, a ancient holiday with two derivations has been revived. The Inner Sea nations other than Sembara tend to celebrate it in the original Northerner form, a day on which the dead return, and humanity hides. Sembara celebrates the holiday as it was celebrated in the First Great Empire, with strong influences from Ogre traditions and the original Hkarian tradition of revering one's ancestors. In Dunmar, the Day of the Dead has remained in form similar to the Northern one, except much of the dread has been removed, and the holiday is more light-hearted in general. Chardon has no Day of the Dead.

## Religion

_"In the beginning, there was a void. Two brothers, Aru and Melkor dwelt there for time uncounted, exploring and growing in power"_  
-Human Creation Myth

#### Cosmology:

![](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/zjihCoDd6nkjnJSPmobHfcashZ5sM05RxtevaKpJ5t5rTWoM=s0-d-e1-ft#http://tmulti.gif)The center of all existence is the infinite, indestructable, _greyspace_. This column is the metaphysical center of the multiverse, and has close ties to the plane of magic and the plane of consciousness. It existed before all else. Beyond the _greyspace_ there are two domains for Aru and Melkor, and respectively. These are the personal domains of the deities. The elves travel to the _whitespace_ when they die. _Whitespace_ and _blackspace_ form the upper and lower hemispheres of the multiverse sphere. Running crosswise through the sphere are the plane of Magic, the plane of consciousness, and Taelgar itself. The plane of Magic and the plane of consciousness both have strong connections to Taelgar, but not to each other. From the plane of Magic all magical enegry on Taelgar is drawn, from divine magic to arcane magic. The plane of consciousness is where the consciousness exists, and where people are taken during particularly vivid dreams.

#### Afterlife:

The existence of an afterlife depends upon race. The elves are the only ones with a definite, and permanent afterlife. When elves die, if they are given a proper burial within a set time, they go live with Eru forever, in the _whitespace_. If they are not, their spirit is loose, and may either dissipate, or stay tied to the earth forever. Dwarves and Ogres do not retain their consciousness after they die, but they do have an afterlife of sorts. Their souls merge with the mountains. In certain holy spots, you can almost feel the accumulated wisdom of thousands of years radiating from them. Like dwarves and ogres, the lizard men do not retain their consciousness, but they do become one with nature. The reason lizard men are such good healers is because they can draw on the spirit-force of their ancestors. When humans and halflings races die, it is over. They are gone forever.

#### Theology:

There are only two true gods of Taelgar, Aru and Melkor. They are worshipped in various forms and incarnations in all cultures, among all races. In addition to the true gods, there are divine "aspects." for each race. The firstborn being of a race, Aru, and Melkor combined in a strange way to create "aspects" Those races who do not have a firstborn do not have aspects. Worship of Melkor is generally considered uncivilized or even downright evil but most cultures.

Aru and Melkor are responsible for maintaining the balance between good and evil, life and death, creation and destruction that exists on Taelgar. Because the previous civilization collapsed through inbalance (see History), Aru and Melkor strive to keep the multiverse cyclic and balanced, so that it will not collaspe again. Because of this, they do not take sides in the affairs of Taelgar, and rarely become involved in any way. They will not act to help or hinder anything on Taelgar.

#### Aru and Melkor:

Aru and Melkor are the remanents of an ancient magic rich civilization that, through decadance, caused the multiverse to collaspe. All that survived was the greyspace, dragons, Aru and Melkor, and a few artifacts. Aru and Melkor started again, but seeking always to maintain balance and prevent the collapse of the multiverse a second time. The holy symbol of Aru is a circle with a cross in the middle, sometimes a plain circle, or occassionally a serpent swallowing its own tail. Melkor's symbol is

#### Aspects:

Each race (that has a firstborn) has an aspect. The kenku are the paradoxically exception to this rule (see Kenku). The aspects of the races are:

- Elves -- Aru
- Kenku -- Vorshitaal
- Halflings --
- Ogre --
- Dwarves --
- Lizardmen --

#### Creation:

_The human creation myth follows. For what really happened, see History_

In the beginning, there was a void. Two brothers, Aru and Melkor dwelt there for time uncounted, exploring and growing in power. Eventually, they discovered a new power, a power of the binding and unbinding of reality. Drawing from the center of this power, they discovered how to create, and destroy.

Aru, in his eagerness to grow, began to create, and what he made was beautiful. Melkor saw what his brother was doing, and was jealous of his brother's creativity. But when he tried himself, he found that he could create nothing of beauty, being tainted by jealousy for his brother. In that instant, he decided his brother was a better person than he was, and so what could he do but be evil? All of Aru's offers of reconciliation fell on deaf ears.

In time, Aru grew in his strength, and became daring. Mustering all his power and courage, he began to sing, and with his song the earth was born. It was given the name Taelgar. Deciding that his creation needed a people to give it life and color, he created the elves. He made them friends with the trees and the flowers, the birds and the fish, even the lowly insects. But nothing could escape Melkor's influence; especially not something created by his truest brother. So the elves became aloof and distrustful of the outside world.

After having created a people to populate the world, and finding them only living in the forests, Aru decided he must create more. From the stone of the highest mountains, the chill air and snow, he molded the ogre, strong and brave and wise. Yet they too were caught by Melkor, and made to love their mountains too much. Rarely, if ever, did the ogre come down from their lofty peaks to grace the world of man.

So Aru created another race, a race dwelling under the mountains. If civilization could not flourish throughout the land, why not in the mountains? The dwarves were made from the roots of the earth, stoic and enduring. The dwarves, finally, were a race that could develop a great civilization, albeit under the mountains. They were numerous and prosperous, honorable and courageous. Yet even they could not escape Melkor's evil. He made them too honorable, so honorable that the race was sundered. Over half the race, including a disproportionate number of females, left because they could not accept inter-dwarven war. As far as anyone knows, they all disappeared. Ironically, soon after that the dwarves established themselves as one kingdom under a high king.

After the dwarves, who were made in the same mold as the elves and ogre failed to spread throughout Taelgar, Aru began experimenting with other races. He created the lizard men, a peaceful race of healers, hoping they could civilize the world. But they lacked the ambition and drive to expand. He created the halflings, making them curious enough to travel, but Melkor twisted it the other direction, so they ended up with no homeland, and no desire to settle down, and so took to the seas.

Finally, Aru created the humans. They were different from all the races that had come before. They were far more diverse and adaptable. They were shorter lived, but more ambitious and daring than the previous races. However, they were not as pure. As they began to grow and spread, their impurity began to show. Some humans were not friendly, they were jealous. Some were humble, but just as many were arrogant. But in their adaptability, they prospered, and became the race of Taelgar.

#### The Church:

The organized priesthood is very small. Since most people tend to worship at home, if they worship and all, there is no need for priests to tend the flock. Most people only visit temples during high holidays, and when in need of solace. The only people allowed to become priests, therefore, are those who have the spark (can channel divine magic). This makes the priesthood extremely small, and extremely uncorrupt. Priests tend to spread out over Taelgar, each settling into some small area some distance away from their nearest brethen. Only the large temples in Chardon and Marsember have more than one priest to tend them.

Worship of the Aru tends to be limited, for most people realize that he cannot and will not affect the world. However, wearing holy symbols is relatively common among the devote, as are short prayers, often of thanks, before meals, at night, and other appropriate times.

There is no religious document purporting to speak the word of Aru. The one collection of documents which speaks of Aru, and theology (_The Scrolls of the Divine_) is a scholarly work, and not often read by the common folk. This work was passed down through oral tradition until the Second Age, when a priest of Hkar transcribed it, and expanded upon many of the ideas within.

## History

Taelgarian history is counted from the collapse of the multiverse due to the over-use of magic by Aru and Melkor's civilization. All that is left is the greyspace, in which dragons, Aru, and Melkor reside. A few artificts of the old civilization also remain, scattered about in the greyspace. At this point, the history of Taelgar begins.

#### Pre-time:

- Aru and Melkor create the whitespace and blackspace.
- Aru and Melkor, working together, form the plane of Magic, from the remants of the magic of the old civilization.
- The Dreamworld/Plane of consciousness is created, either explicted by Aru and Melkor, or implicted through the existance of either the plane of magic or some thinking beings.
- Aru and Melkor move from the greyspace to the whitespace and blackspace, respectively, and create Taelgar.
- Dragons move about, some leaving the greyspace for Taelgar, others leaving it for the plane of magic or the plane of consciousness, and others remaining in the greyspace.
- Aerin, Beryl, Rai, and Kyr arrive, and depart shortly, leaving behind a new aspect, for the kenku. Yet no kenku firstborn exists. (See Kenku for more on this paradox).
- The Firstborn are created by Aru and Melkor: One ogre, two elves (a unicorn and a living tree), three halflings (the wanderer, the merchant, and the sailor), four lizardmen (the elements), and seven dwarves.
- The Firstborn build the white temple in the mountains, vanishing after the building is done. This causes their respective races to awaken, and time to begin

#### Pre-Age

Before the awakening of humanity, dragons were mostly unified and tended not to fight. During this time, they explored the new world and tested there powers, and the limits set upon them by Aru and Melkor. Dragon politics was not yet the complex game it becomes, once the Ages begin

- The Firstborn races grow and learn, and other races are created by Dragons, or perhaps even one of the ancient artifacts.
- Aru and Melkor, trying to prevent the collapse of the multiverse had created many races. None however, contained the diversity they felt was necessary for this goal to be achieved. Thus, they created humanity, and thus began the First Age

#### First Age

The First Age was the time of the Elves, and great wars were fought between the elves and some of the races dragons had created (notably mind-flayers and hobgoblins).

- Humanity is created near Drankhor. For many years, they grow and learn.
- Humanity first makes contact the other races, and becomes friendly with the halflings. A mixing of cultures, to some degree, begins.
- The Great Sundering. The Dwarven race splits to avoid intradwarven war. Half the race, and a disproportionate number of females, leave for the Southern deserts, and afterwards are called Gnomes.
- The Age ends with a cataclysmic war between the elves and the mind flayers. Orcs and hobgolbins fight on the side of the mind flayers, and lizardmen, some halflings, and some humans fight on the side of the elves. The rest of the humans remain neutral. This war leads to the hatred of orcs, hobgoblins, and mind flayers by many other races. The elves are victorious, and a dragon, Pythus, is killed. This ends the Age.

#### Second Age

Hkar. Great Dwarven Empires. Huge underground tunnel systems are built beneath the Khazad Mountains. The Dwarf-Orc wars end the Age and decimate the dwarves, causing many of the once light caverns to fall silent. Runic Magic is lost at the end of the Age, and Hkar sinks.

#### Third Age

First Great Empire, ruled by Darius, is destroyed by the Plague of Cha'Mutte. The Age ends with the reemergence of the Plague, and Cha'Mutte attempting to destroy the Firstborn of all the races.  

#### Fourth Age:

The 4th Age began in chaos. Some of the more important events of the early fourth age.

1 F.A. With Cha'mutte's death, the plague begins to spread again. However, there is nothing keeping it from being dispersed by the wind. (ChaMutte had his limits, after all. It was more important to  
him to use the plague as a barrier between Dunmar and Sembara than to kill lots of people with it, so he expanded it to the largest size he could hold stable, and then stopped.) After spreading in all directions for several weeks, it slowly begins to disperse. It spreads into southern Sembara and eastern Dunmar before beginning to blow away. Both countries suffer heavy losses, although Dunmar suffers more. General panic ensues in Dunmar. By the middle of the first year after Cha'mutte's death, the plague has blown west, decimated Turmish and also further cutting off the north from the south, as all the existing trade stops are destroyed. The Turmish government completely collapses. Dunmar can only maintain order west of the river. The capital is relocated. The plague, fortunately, missed Marsember, but barely. Much of the population flees to the northern strongholds. Also in this year, the hobgoblins that survived begin to attempt to spread in all directions. The dwarves and ogre, outnumbered perhaps 15 to 1, fight a prolonged retreat over the course of several months, finally arriving back in the mountains exhausted, and suffering greatly. The elves also fight a prolonged retreat, outnumbered maybe 50 to 1, although this doesn't bother them so much. Many elves die, however, further reducing the population, almost below sustainable levels.

1  5 F.A. A side effect of the dispersal of the plague is toxic rain, as it gets into the upper atmosphere. Sporadic deaths, and a great deal of property destruction occurs.

3 F.A. A message was received from the elves saying We are in dire trouble. Send aid. Unfortunately, no one was in any shape to send aid. 6 F.A Dunmar and Sembara build a new road, avoiding the remains of Irebor. The roadway from the South is connected to this new road. Trade begins to move along it, and the small village of Alcar begins to grow.

1  52 F.A. The Hobgoblin Wars. The number of hobgoblins and other nasties in the north was greatly underestimated by all. ChaMutte had kept huge reserves in the other dimension, whom he had magically altered to be plague resistant. The plan was to dr op them in the plague on the borders of Sembara and Dunmar as soon as the massive armies sent north by the "good guys" had been destroyed. He died before he could do that. After several days of not getting the "go-ahead" order, the hobgoblins decided to l eave. Perhaps 500,000 hungry, desperate hobgoblins, wanting territory for themselves, began fighting their way south. For fifty years, wars raged across the north, fought primarily by Chardonians and those in the Rohirrim and Sembaran armies who, because of the plague, no longer had families to go home to. The kenku also played a major role in these battles. However, the plague circulating in the upper atmosphere caused many problems for the kenkumany died before the cause was figured out. Eventually, at gr eat cost, the hobgoblins were reduced in number sufficiently so they could not put up a fight. They fled to the foothills of the mountains, some settling the northern areas of what used to be Volkraad, others settling in Pandar, or south along the mountains . Everything north of Chardon is effectively abandoned to the wilderness.

10  12 F.A. Kenku begin to establish Vasa as their homeland (primarily Vasa, since Volkraad is still overrun by hobgoblins). The do not spread far from the mountains, however.

1  20 F.A. Chardon sends exploratory vessels northward, finding only wreckage where the country of Amn used to be. No attempt to resettle is made.

26 F.A. Current king of Dunmar dies. The new horse is born, but, in an unprecedented move, does not pick a king. Instead, rides north and west, towards the area of Dunmar that has been abandoned the longest. Dunmar sinks further into chaos. Effectively s tops existing as a country.

33 F.A. Derik III lives to the ripe old age of 74, and later becomes known as one of the great kings of Sembara. Revin I takes the throne.

54 F.A. New Volkraad is founded not far north from the Lizard man swamp. King Ranth vows to reclaim his country from the hobgoblins.

66 F.A. With the wars over, Chardon begins to grow. It sends exploratory vessels southward, but they never return.

74 F.A. The horse of Dunmar returns, rode by a young King. He begins to gather people, and rebuild his country. Eventually becomes known as one of the greatest kings of Dunmar ever.

79 F.A. Several frontier outposts established north of New Volkraad. Heavy raiding from hobgoblins is experience. King Ranth manages to hold the frontier, but at a cost. Several of the outposts are abandoned, and the others are reinforced.

#### Politics:

The important city-states, countries, and organizations of the 4th Age are as follows:

Chardon:

Chardon is a major country, containing 3 million people, of which probably 80,000 live in Chardon City itself, and another 200,000 live within a days ride. A center of trade and knowledge. It is run by a Council headed by an elected Mayor. The Council is divided into the lower Council, consisting of between 50-100 elected officials, and the upper Council, consisting of 10 members selected by the Mayor. The lowe Council has very little power. Chardon has a relatively significant navy, and its standing army has been drastically enlarged over the past 50 years. One of the most important features of Chardon is Mt. Chardon, an extinct volcano. One side of Mt. Chardon is sheer, and looks like black glass. It is completely smoth and straight.

Sembara:

Sembara is another major country, and although the recent hobgoblin wars and current problems with babarians and pirates have weakened it, it is still perhaps the most important and powerful country in Taelgar. Currently relations with the dwarves and Dunmar are very good, as are relations with Chardon. Some tension exists between Sembara and the kenku, but this is mostly due to the fact that Derik III and his son both felt personally thankful to the kenku for all they did during the hobgoblin wars and the Great War. Marik tends to treat the kenku as just another country to be dealt with, and for this first time in almost 50 years, the Northern Wall has patrols, although light ones. Sembara is ruled by a constitutional monarchy, which is composed of the King and a Barons Court, which is composed of the Barons and Dukes of various cities within Sembara. The capital of Sembara is Marsember. Some of the more important duchies include the Duchy of Procampur, the Duchy of Marsember, and the Duchy of Telmare.

Dunmar:

Dunmar suffered devastating losses in the Great War and the subsequent Plague years. Without a king for 48 years, they fell into chaos and substance farmers and horse herders. Little in the way of rebuilding was done, as every family made do with what was at hand. The cities of the Rohirrim emptied, and are only now beginning to be rebuild. Furthermore, the once magnificent army crumbled, and, although reborn, is not what it used to be. Hobgoblin raids from the southern edge of the mountains occur considerably more often then they should. Dunmar is ruled by an absolute monarch, picked by some supernatural means, perhaps having to do with the spear of the king, or the horse of the Rohirrim. Dunmar is the bread basket of Taelgar, and tends to export large amounts of grain.

Alcar:

This city was founded near to the site of Irebor, but far enough away to avoid the supposed curse upon that city. It is still relatively small, but recent dwarven trade is lending to its importance. It is an oligarchy, ruled by representatives from the major merchant houses of the area. Since it is outside any current country, many merchant houses base themselves here to avoid taxes and other regulations of established countries. It has the feel of some combination between a trade town and a frontier town.

Other:

Several other organizations exist of some importance. The most important is probably the Rangers, a general force for peace and restoration in the Sembaran area. The Chardon Academy can also weild significant political clout when necessary.

{title: Sembara in Highschool}

Before the King <name>, Sembara was a collection of warring principalities,
 with several kings, princes, and dukes, all tracing their power back to
 Drankorian aristrocratic positions.
 In most of Sembara, the people traced their ancestory back to <name>, whereas
 in the northwest (Tirith, Brannon, Vaul, mostly), the people traced their
 ancestory back to <name>.

In 1621 <name> was born.
 He became a great leader and warrior, and, in a series of campaigns, had
 conquerored most of Sembara by 1649, when he was crowned the first King
 of Sembara.
 At this point, he controlled the areas of Sembara bordering the Inner Sea.
 As king, he replaced the various dukes and princes of the land with barons,
 loyal to him, and owing him the service of their warriors, loyality, and
 fealitly, from themselves and their heirs, for eternity.
 He also founded the Knights of the Shield, and the Knights of the Realm,
 both special orders of knights which anyone could join, but which had stringent
 requirements of fitness, mental, spiritual, and physical.
 The Knights of the Realm swore to defend the realm from all evils, and
 uphold the king from all dangers.
 The Knights of the Shield went through additional training in scouting,
 tracking, and surviving in the wilderness, and additional weapons training,
 and swore to defend the borders of Sembara against all threats, swearing
 to uphold the House of <name> as the embodiment of Sembara.

When <name> died in 1670, he left a son of some 25 years, who suceeded him
 on the throne of Sembara.
 <name1> continued his father's conquests, conqueroring the northern reaches
 of Sembara and much of modern Corwil.
 The new barons, who had been generally very loyal to <name>, are less so
 to <name1>, especially as they themselves start to be replaced by their
 sons.
 <name1> wisely decides not to attempt any further conquest, and spends
 the latter part of his reign struggling, politely, with the baron's.
 He dies, unsastified with his progess, in 1702, leaving a son of 26 behind.
 <name2> is an ambitious conqueor, and dreams of what his grandfather had
 never wanted, a empire spanning the Inner Sea.
 He launches as series of campaigns into the Vasan northlands shortly after
 becoming king, none of which are particularly successful.
 Despite his failures, he begins reoganizing and raising armies for a campaign
 into Comor in 1717, which he hopes will give him another route to Vasa,
 and valuable land in his dreams of empire as well.
 However, two things prevented his fleet from every launching.
 The first was a subtly rewording of the oaths of the Knights of the Shield,
 who had been heavily utilized in the Vasan campaign.
 The changed the reference to the House of <name> to refer simply to the people of Sembara, thus reliving them of an felt obligation to support the king in what they  considered a useless conquest.
 Secondly, the baron's refused to give any monetary support to the expedition.
 The amount of military service owed was largely insufficient, because,
 during the Vasan campaigns, the baron's had quitely begun considering anyone
 from their land who joined the Knightly orders to be part of the baron's
 owed military service to the king.
 This had gone unchagellened by <name2>, because the baron's had been forthcoming with gold to support the Vasan campaigns, and many of the northern lords
 supported it wholeheartedly, giving generously of time, men and money. The Comor campaign thus failed, and fifteen years later (1732), <name2>
 dies, amidst domestic squabbles over the obligations of the Baron's.
 The next three kings, <name3> (1695-1739), <name4> (1715-1748), <name5>
 (1732-1758) struggled against the Baron's, and generally failed to make
 much progress.

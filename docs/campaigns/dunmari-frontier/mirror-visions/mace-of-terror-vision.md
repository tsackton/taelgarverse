{title: Mace of Terror Vision}
---
As you hold up the mace to the mirror, the first thing you see is the middle of a massive war. 

Everything is just totally chaotic. A human warrior in plate mail armor is holding the mace, and trolls, hobgoblins, and other evil creatures are streaming through a gate. The fort this warrior is defending is apparently in the process of being overrun. Although fear radiating from the mace seems to hold back the tide for a moment, a hobgoblin spellcaster steps into view, and unleashes a lightning bolt that kills the warrior, and the mace falls to the ground. 

The scene shifts, and you see two people standing over the mace. A human women, dressed in leather armor, wearing a traveling cloak, a bow and pan pipes slung against her side, seeming to be humming a low tune. Next to her is a dwarf, heavily armored. The fort is overgrown, covered in woods. The woman points at the mace, and the dwarf picks it up, dropping it into a small pouch that seems to be bigger on the inside, large enough to contain the mace without trouble. This is some time after the Great War, but when or where,  exactly, is not clear. 

The scene shifts again, and you see the same dwarf sitting in the entry room and dining hall of Fausto's tower. Fausto and the dwarf are speaking, perhaps arguing, then turns and leaves in something of a huff. The same woman in leather follows him, as does a stoneborn warrior with a big sword slung over his back, who you have not seen before.

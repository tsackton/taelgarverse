title: Urgall's Note Vision
---

You hold the thin piece of parchment up to the mirror, and watch as the scene fades. 

An image of [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) appears, sitting at his desk in his cabin. He is wearing a dark cloak over leather armor, his hood thrown back, tangled black hair falling in messy curls framing eyes that shine with an obsessive gleam. He is holding a quill, and writing on the paper. 

There seems to be another piece of paper he is referencing, that you cannot quite see. He is clearly writing numbers in pairs, and with each pair he seems to be moving his finger to a particular spot on the key, and then muttering numbers to himself. Wellby reads his lips: “44, yes. 23. 15. 52.” It goes on like this for a while. Over time as you watch, it seems like the key is some kind of grid, as his finger repeated goes to the same places on the paper. 

As he finishes the note, he reaches over and crumples up the key, and turns to open the lantern, lighting the key on fire and holding it until it burns, scorching his hand as well. 

He then turns back to the note, smoothes it over, and as he rolls it up, he is whispering. Wellby reads: ‘All praise to Mash-too? Mash-tu? Mass-tou? (you are not quite sure of the word, it seems to be a name), I will do this task.”

The image fades.

title: Shadow Hunter's Mask Vision
---

The image in the mirror shows a room, underground, light only by candle light and two torches burning on the wall. A man is tied to a chair – the same face that the shadow hunter you killed had after he died. But the bonds look loose, and the man is not resisting. He seems to be staring off into space, unaware of his surroundings.

The mask is sitting on a table, next to a black crown, seemingly made of some kind of matte black iron with four dark gems, black pearls or opal of some kind, set in the four points. A faint dark smoke seems to be seeping from the crown.

[Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) steps into view, and holds the mask near the crown, casting some kind of spell or otherwise expending energy to transfer energy from the crown to the mask. The black whisps grow thicker, and begin to collect on the mask. [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) carefully lifts the mask with a gloved hand, and presses it to the unresisting face of the person in the chair. As the mask fuses to his face, the shadow blackness drains and the mask turns red. The person begins to change as well, limbs elongating, whisps of shadow growing around his face and arms, and a spear dripping with black shadows materializing in his hand. 

He stands, and [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) hands him four chalyte gems and a drawing of [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), pointing at them and speaking. The image fades.

title: Hralgar's Eyes Vision
---

You hold the giant's eyes to the mirror, trying to see how they ended up this way, how Hralgar was bound and and caught.

The first thing that you see, as the mirror clears, is what almost looks like clouds are blowing away from the surface, instead of the black transitions that are typical of visions in this mirror. A workshop somewhere comes into focus, not a place you recognize, not a room that you've been in before. It's big, and there are 
maybe a half a dozen people scurrying around. Some are tapping, carefully, seeming to be crafting the eyes from from stone, from gems. Others are casting spells, chanting and performing magical rituals in the background as wizards and artificers work on creating and polishing the eyes. Over the course of weeks -- sped up in the view in the mirror -- the eyes are finished. Eudomes only appears rarely during this time. 

The scene shift suddenly, and you can see the statue, the bust of Hralgar, wearing a crown with five stones set in it, the stones that were missing when you saw the bust in the tower, the stones that were taken by Dee and Dain and Alban and brought back to Fausto. Lightning is crackling between these stones, sparking between them, creating a web of static energy over the top of the statue. Suddenly the bust slumps, slowly becomes almost malleable, and you can see the two stones, the two eyes, being slowly pushed into the softening stone. 

As this happens, there is a massive strike of lightning, striking the tower, and everything shakes for a moment. You can see Eudomes now, standing in front of you, chanting some sort of magic, speaking. 

Wellby attempts to read lips and gives a halting phonetic translation, not well enough to make out more than one word in four, but enough to tell this is an argument, Eudomes is speaking of an airship, and as the scene fades he is saying, 'fine, then I will keep you.'

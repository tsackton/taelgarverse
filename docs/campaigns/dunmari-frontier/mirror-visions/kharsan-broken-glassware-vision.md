# Kharsan Broken Glassware Vision

When [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) holds the broken glassware to the mirror, you see a hot fire and a narrow metal pipe of the glass being forged, and then many days of blurring light and dark and light and dark as time passes, until in early summer the glass is shattered by an enormous, giant sized axe flickering with fire. 

This brings to mind the fire giant who led a horde of [Orcs](<../../../species/orcs.md>) into [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) during the [Blood Years](<../../../events/1500s/blood-years.md>) after the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), who could have been the one to destroy [Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>).

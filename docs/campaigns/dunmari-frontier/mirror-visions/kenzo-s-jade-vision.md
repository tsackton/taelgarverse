As you hold the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../treasure/gifts-and-heirlooms/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>) up to the mirror, images flash before your eyes.  

- A tower, that you’ve seen before in your dreams, a flash of a room of people.
- Running through a city, but flickering and flashing so quickly you can’t pick up details, although not a city you’ve been in before.
- The flickering slows, and a what comes into focus is a mountain pass, a building on a cliff, a huge dark form of a dragon looming above everything, and a purple light as everything breaks.
- Then, an image of falling in the darkness, something falling through blackness, looking down at something falling into a dark, endless pit.
- An ashy, barren plain. Reflected in the mirror a shimmering darkness cutting a hole in the landscape that shouldn’t be there. Purple light emanating from a hand being held in front of the hole, energy collecting on the edges of the fissure, pulling it shut. As the fissure closes, a lash of darkness, like a black whip, reaches out and strikes the hand.
- Then, falling in darkness again, but this time towards a desert landscape below, on a moonless night. Landing on the dry dusty ground.
- A hand reaching down to pick up the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../treasure/gifts-and-heirlooms/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>) from the desert ground.
- Slowing, focusing on one image for longer. Two Dunmari standing in front of a hand being held out, the hand holding the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../treasure/gifts-and-heirlooms/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>). The people in front of the hand are a man and a woman. The woman has a dark, deeply tanned face, short black hair, calm eyes, and looks maybe four months pregnant. The man is agitated, and talking animatedly, gesturing with his hands.

title: Urgall's Helm Vision
---


You hold the helm up to the mirror, and the scene fades for a moment. 

You see a man standing on the bow of the [Flaming Tempest](<../../../things/ships/flaming-tempest.md>), presumably [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>), wearing the helm. He is holding a trader -- probably a Tollender -- in the air. The Tollender is begging, asking [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) to save his life, but [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) does not seem to care, and slashes in throat. A strange dark mist creeps out of the slit throat, seeming to seep into [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>)'s helm. The scene continues as [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) threatens and interrogates another sailor, the navigator, who also begs for his life, promising to tell [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) where something, or somewhere, is -- you cannot quite see what place he sketches directions to. Then his throat is slit as well.

The scene shifts, and you see [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) standing on the deck of ship, caught in an act of twisted devotion, as he casts a spell to control the waters, causing the ship to turn, and sail straight into the wind, propelled by the spell, as it approaches Vetta. 

The scene shifts, and you see the one-sided battle for Vetta, the slaughter of the pilgrims and priests of the island, as [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) and his crew descend, fireballs shooting from [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>)'s hands as he shouts spells into the dark night. 

Finally, you see [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>), standing in the temple of Vetta, slitting the throats of ten of his crew. As each dies, the sacred waters of the temple of Vetta begin to boil and churn, and suddenly you see a tentacle emerging from the sacred waters in the distance, and black acid begin to seep over everything. This, clearly, is a scene of ritual sacrifice, where [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) is slaughtering his own crew to summon a demon, Mashtu the Corruptor or some servant of his. 

The scene fades.

title: Urgall's Helm Vision
---

You hold the helm up to the mirror, and the scene fades for a moment. 

You see a man standing on the bow of the [Flaming Tempest](<../../../things/ships/flaming-tempest.md>), presumably [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>), wearing the helm. He is holding a trader -- probably a Tollender -- in the air. The Tollender is begging, asking [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) to save his life, but [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) does not seem to care, and slashes in throat. A strange dark mist creeps out of the slit throat, seeming to seep into [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>)'s helm. The scene continues as [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) threatens and interrogates another sailor, the navigator, who also begs for his life, promising to tell [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) where something, or somewhere, is -- you cannot quite see what place he sketches directions to. Then his throat is slit as well.

The scene shifts, and you see [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) standing on the deck of ship, caught in an act of twisted devotion, as he casts a spell to control the waters, causing the ship to turn, and sail straight into the wind, propelled by the spell, as it approaches [Vetta](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/vetta.md>). 

The scene shifts, and you see the one-sided battle for [Vetta](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/vetta.md>), the slaughter of the pilgrims and priests of the island, as [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) and his crew descend, fireballs shooting from [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>)'s hands as he shouts spells into the dark night. 

Finally, you see [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>), standing in the temple of [Vetta](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/vetta.md>), slitting the throats of ten of his crew. As each dies, the sacred waters of the temple of [Vetta](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/vetta.md>) begin to boil and churn, and suddenly you see a tentacle emerging from the sacred waters in the distance, and black acid begin to seep over everything. This, clearly, is a scene of ritual sacrifice, where [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>) is slaughtering his own crew to summon a demon, Mashtu the Corruptor or some servant of his. 

The scene fades.

title: Cha'mutte Armband Vision
---

The mirror, as usual, goes black. For a moment, you see a vast store in some underground room, lit by flickering lanterns, where there are weapons of all kinds, swords, axes, polearms, armor. Being driven, dragged into this room you see two kenku, iron bands on their wrists, pretty disheveled in appearance. A hobgoblin, behind them, poking them with a spear, driving them forward. 

Stepping out of the shadows, in front of the arm band, in front of the kenku you can see, is a man, maybe 6 1/2 or 7 feet tall, wearing a black cloak hiding his face, tall black leather boots, chain mail armor, and glowing red eyes from the depths of the shadows under his cloak. He picks up the arm band, and he hands it to one of the kenku, making a magical gesture with one hand. The two kenku, one of whom is carrying the armband, scurry out of the room. 

You see, then, from the perspective of the arm band, taking off in the in the courtyard of this castle, and then flying up, seeing the land below you. A row of black mountains, of dark volcanic rock, but with snow on some peaks, except the active volcano with lava flowing down its side. The castle, fort, is now getting smaller, is set on the side of these mountains. As you drift higher  you can see vast camps, army camps, at least 10,000 troops, maybe more, just in rows next to this this castle.

Flying higher still, you can see this is just one of many fortresses, laid along the border of this land. You keep flying, heading east now, following the line of mountains, flying over this land that is prepared for war.

Until you come to a flat area, a ledge or clearing of sorts on the lower slopes of the mountain range, and you land. The armband clatters to the ground for a moment, until it is picked up, and put on by one of these kenku. You can see little black tendrils, webs, creep up from the armband and embed themselves in the in the flesh of this creature. Until suddenly, without warning, a pool of darkness appears in the side of the cliff, a flat, black, expansive shadow. The vision ends as the kenku step through the portal, and begin to walk across the shadowlands.

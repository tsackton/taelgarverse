{title: Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum Viision}

You hold the small book to the mirror, and for a moment the image fades to black. Then you see, appearing in the mirror, an image of the face of a young woman, maybe 17 or 18. She has blonde hair tied back, gray brown eyes, tanned skin, and is wearing elegant robes. She seems to be sitting at a desk, looking down, studying this book. The room is pretty spare and plain, and looks fair less elegant than the wealth implied by her clothes. 

The woman then mutters some incantation, and makes a slashing motion. After that, she begins to pour over the book, seemingly studying, turning the pages and reading, although you cannot make out the words in the reflection. Some time later, she glances up as if at a noise at the door, says another incantation, some other magic you can't quite recognize. Then your perspective becomes jumbled and confused, as if you were tossed in a bag of many items.

The scene shifts to a much more elegant room: a stained glass window lets in multi-hued light, a large tapestry hangs on the stone walls depicting an epic naval battle with magic flashing between the ships, a golden candelabra, currently unlit, hangs from the ceiling. Somebody is writing in the book, an older man. He is writing with a strange quill, not a normal bird feather, threads of actual silver running through some of the barbs. As he continues to write slowly in the book, pausing to think now and again, the vision fades.

# The Phasing Stone Vision

A vision of the [Phasing Stone](<../../../things/magic-items/phasing-stones.md>) from [Hralgar's Palace](<../../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/hralgar-s-palace.md>) seen in the [Mirror of the Past](<../treasure/mirror-of-the-past.md>).

You hold the phasing stone to the mirror, and the scene shifts.

For a moment, all is a blur. You see swirling colors, images shifting to fast to see, a blurred void as if spinning and tumbling through a dream. You see [Kurome](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kurome.md>), the master of dreams from who you rescued the phasing stone, and then suddenly all is still.

You are resting in a mess of silvery threads, floating above a marble bowl. Hralgar is standing some distance from you, laughing and talking, seemingly holding court. You cannot see who he is talking to -- they must be humans, or smaller -- not giants. Whatever language Hralgar is speaking, it is not one that Wellby knows. But he seems happy. He walks over to you, and lifts his hand, and it is suddenly night. The stars begin to come out, bright and twinkling, and seemingly dancing in the sky, almost as if they are moving to form new shapes, new constellations. 

The scene shifts and suddenly you are high in the sky, above a heavily forested mountain range. You are in the hands of a giant, flying serenely through the sky, although it is hard to judge size. She is wearing flowing white robes, that stream from her body blending into clouds, as she flies. The clouds spin off into forms of birds, and fish, and flowers. Occasionally, the clouds will spin into colors. You watch as one cloud shifts from a bird into a phoenix, bright red and dancing with fire, seemingly real. 

The scene shifts. You are in darkness. Suddenly, a flash of light, bright as sunlight, illuminates the space for a second. You are underground, in a cavern, but not a natural cavern. The walls are completely smooth, and form a semicircular dome over your head. For a brief instance you see in the flash of light a massive statue of a person, much large than life size, with bulky arms and a long, craggy face. As the light fades, you swear you saw the statue's eyes open. Then another flash, and this time it is clear the stone statue moved his hand, slightly, seeming to be directing the flashes of light in your direction. With the next flash, you notice that the light is somehow becoming compressed, tightened into a crystal. Within the light you see endless dreams, echoing.

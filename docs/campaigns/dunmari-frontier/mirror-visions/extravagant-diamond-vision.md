{title: Extravagant Diamond Vision}
---
You hold the beautifully cut diamond up to the mirror, and the scene turns black for a moment and then you see a dwarf, sitting in a workshop, looking at the diamond through a lens, a gemcutter probably. They seem to be paying an inordinate amount of attention crafting and shaping this diamond and occasionally like holding it up and examining it. The scene is underground, in a Dwarven city none of you recognize, and probably some time ago. 

Then, a flash of images pass by. Being traded, first to other [Dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>), underground, and then the flash of the sun and traveling along a road, through a forest of massive trees, like redwoods stretching to the sky. The road follows the course of a river down from the mountains, but you just catch glimpses of the passing scene. 

The image shifts, and you see a brief glimpse of [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) – just a flash of towers of the skyline, and the silhouette of the long extinct black obsidian volcano that looms over the city. 

The image shifts again, and you see a brief flash of a storeroom full of chests. And then darkness, for a long time – the inside of a locked chest. 

The image shifts again, and you see a halfling trading caravan leaving [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), a large caravan, no one you recognize, but you get the sense this is 50 to 100 years ago. Not recent, but within a halfling generation or two. Brief glimpses of the sky along the road to [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), until you recognize the city of [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) on the horizon, and the image shifts again.

Now, sitting in [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s hut. Drinking tea, a Dunmari man holding the diamond. Speaking urgently with [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>), pleading and anxious, then handing over the diamond. He is a man in his late 50s, short cropped gray hair, eyes weary from long sleepless nights, and perhaps tears. His clothing is plain, unfancy, and his demeanor suggests someone not used to being in the presence of creatures with [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s power, overwhelmed and desperate. Perhaps a temple guard or a retired warrior, but not someone of renown. And as the diamond passes into [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s hand, the scene fades.

# Pandemonium Scroll Vision

Vision of a [scroll associated with Pandemonium](<../treasure/treasure-from-tokra/pandemonium-scroll.md>) in [The Mirror of the Past](<../treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/the-mirror-of-the-past.md>). 

The image in the mirror of the reflection of the scroll begins to fade, and the mirror turns dark. 

Not quite black – everything is dim and shades of gray, but you can vaguely make out what look like looming stones ahead. It seems that that you are seeing a path in the flat grayness, and although you cannot hear anything in the mirror, you almost feel as if you can hear the echoes of a howling wind. Something about the way the image is reflected in the mirror almost makes you cover your ears in pain, as the sound which you can almost feel in your mind grows to an intense howl. And you see a figure walking on this path, a humanoid, wearing a dark flowing cloak and a hood, pulled tight against the wind. The cloak is flapping and billowing, and every now and then it will blow up and you can see they are wearing armor, a breastplate under the cloak. 

You watch as this figure continues to struggle up the path, and your view follows behind this figure as it seems to climb higher and higher, the shadows of the darkness closing in and making sight impossible for more than a few feet beyond the figure. Until after some indeterminate time there is a break in the darkness ahead, a glint of, not light exactly but lesser darkness, and you see a tower standing at the top of the cliff face the path is ascending. 

The figure reaches the tower, and when they reach the door, they reach out with a gauntleted hand and bang three times, hard, on the door. The door slides open, although all in darkness inside and you cannot see any details of who or what may have opened the door. The figure in the cloak outside bows their head, and grabs a small sack tied to their belt. As they hand the sack to the entity in the tower, you can see that inside the sack is a severed head, although all is dim and you cannot make out any features. 

The creature in the tower takes the head, and hands back the scroll. 

And then the creature turns around, wraps their cloak against the wind, and begins to descend, down the cliffs again. As they keep walking, descending the same path, your sense of time passing seems to jump and you cannot quite tell how long it takes. They seem to be descending into a deep crevasse, a deep crack in the earth, following a switchback trail clinging to the cliff face. As they descend the world falls into complete darkness, until you can see a faint glow coming from below. 

As the figure reaches the bottom of this crevasse, the glow is more intense, and you can see a narrow path along the bottom of the crack, maybe five feet wide, leading towards a light. The figure, now caked in gray dust, turns and walks towards the light. As they approach, the light itself seems to be almost like a mirror, a shimmering surface, and as the figure steps into this mirror, they vanish and your view fades.

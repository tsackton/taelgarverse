{title: Ivory Scroll Cap Vision}
---
The vision that appears in the mirror is of a workshop, full of shadows and flickering flames, with something about it that hints that it a long, long time ago. Shadows flicker, like something is dancing or chanting and blocking or moving the flames. A gloved hand is carving into the ivory of the scroll cap, shaping it. Nearby, a piece of vellum made of skin -- human, probably -- is sitting, unmarked. As the scene progresses, fiery letters begin to appear in the vellum. The scene flickers, and you see again the scroll, rolled up, and a hand, wearing a black glove reaching for it, holding it, and then a burst of light emanating from the hand and the scroll. As the light flashing you feel like this is magic being done, and for a moment you can see a shadow clearly - a demon of some sort, horned head with a long tail, although not the one you fought. Then, the scene fades.

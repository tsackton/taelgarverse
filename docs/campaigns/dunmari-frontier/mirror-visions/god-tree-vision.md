title: God Tree Vision
---

You hold the mirror up to reflect the God tree, and see a reflection of a thriving elvish nursery, branches twisting in a spiral up the tree with platforms woven from giant leaves, holding elven children in various states of trance. The branches sway occasionally, and time speeds up. You see generations pass – hundreds of years – until suddenly the tree bursts into flame.

Soaring above the clearing is a massive red dragon, swooping over the God tree. Gathering below is an army of [elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) and Deno’qai, archers mostly, lining up to rain arrows on the creature, but most fail to penetrate its tough hide, and the warriors below start falling to the flames. 

The scene shifts, and you see emerging from the edge of the clearing a legion of Chardonian soldiers. They raise their shields and brace themselves as four mages step into the protective circle they form and begin casting. Vines start to wrap around the dragon. Some snap, as the dragon struggles, but slowly it is forced from the air. But it is not enough, for the deadly fire of its breath wipes out many of the legion, and the mages call a retreat to regroup. 

The vision fades.

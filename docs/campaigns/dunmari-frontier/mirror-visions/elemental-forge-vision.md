# Elemental Forge Vision

The mirror fades, and you see the forge now brightly lit, the four silvery, wiry threads taunt and vibrating with energy as a woman approaches. It is the same woman you saw a projected illusion of in the entrance hall of the workshop, presumably the Occulta Ludum mage who ran this place towards the end of its time. 

She is carrying what looks like a suit of chain mail. Well, she's not carrying it, it's floating in front of her as if by telekinesis. The chain mail is burnished gold and shining copper mixed with steel, twisted into fine chain links. She lays it down on the forge, and she takes what looks like just a plain piece of stone, a dark, crumbly stone, from a pouch. She's holding it very carefully, and then slowly she lifts it over the forge, and the chain mail, by magic. Then, by some magical force, she crushes it, and a spray of lava bursts out from the stone, coating and being absorbed into the chain mail. As this happens, whirls of smoke rise up, almost forming humanoid shapes, as the lave is absorbed into the metal. 



The scene shifts, and you see a different person. A man this time older, long graying beard, unkempt graying hair, serious eyes. He walks carefully with a staff in dark robes trimmed with gold. He's carrying in front of him a small vial, swirling with what looks like molten glass as he puts it down, bubbling and hissing. As he puts it down on the forge, he closes his eyes for a moment, and draws out with a pair of fine silver tweezers a scale of a gold dragon. He takes it, he drops it into the vial, and with a burst of energy the scale is consumed. Smoke and light fills the vial, and he quickly goes and puts a cap on it and picks it up.



The image shifts. You see a young man, in his twenties, red hair tied back in a topknot. He is wearing light, flexible armor, almost hidden beneath his silk robes. He walks, carrying a silver ring that looks like it is made of twisting clouds, looped around upon themselves. He puts it down on the forge, and leaves for a moment, returning with a vial, a big vial with a thick sealed stopper. The vial is shaking, like it requires strong effort to hold. He begins an incantation, and as the magic finishes he pulls out the stopper and takes a deep breath from the vial. He then turns to the ring, and breaths out a massive gust of wind, swirling, strong enough to lift ring and hold it in the air. A vortex begins to form around the ring, and then collapses in on the ring, which falls solidly to the forge.

{title: Raven Whistle Vision}
---
You are soaring above the desert, looking down at the [Red Mesa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/red-mesa.md>) near [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), soaring across the rocky outcroppings and sunset-toned sand, heading east. You fly over [Bas Udda](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/bas-udda.md>), the people returning to their homes for the evening small and dark against the setting sun. You turn south, and drift, until you come to a line of dead trees, just visible in the twilight, and you follow it south, until you land beside a plain brown mud hut, with a domed roof and chimney, beside a garden of thorns and rocks.

A woman comes from the hut - [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>). She gazes at you - maybe even with a hint of tears in her eyes, and reaches her hand up to you, holding pieces of meat, shredded into strips. You see in the mirror a giant beak reach for the meat, and cough several times, and shake its head, unable to eat.

[Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) sits beside you, whispering something, maybe telling a story. Slowly you see the head of a giant raven lay itself down next to [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>), its breathing slow, and then stop. The scene shifts.

You are looking up at [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) holding you - a wing bone of a giant raven - what will become the [Raven Whistle](<../treasure/raven-whistle.md>) - and carefully working it, singing under her breath the whole time. And the mirror turns black.

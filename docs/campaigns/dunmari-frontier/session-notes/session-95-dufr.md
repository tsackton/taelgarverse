## Narrative

We begin at [The Silver Wolf](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/the-silver-wolf.md>) in [Zvervinka](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/zvervinka.md>), on the afternoon of April 15th, as the party plans with [Roman](<../../../people/other-humans/roman.md>), the innkeeper and general fixer around town. The discussion revolves around travel arrangements, focusing on the procurement of horses, food, and the organization of meetings in the town to ensure a well-prepared departure. [Roman](<../../../people/other-humans/roman.md>) also reports on the magic items available to purchase in the market, with the monster parts the party has brought, and some decisions are made. As lunch ends, Roman leaves to make various arrangements.

Over the afternoon and the next day, the party explores [Zvervinka](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/zvervinka.md>). It is a town of contrasts, with the muddy, damp, and cold streets clustered by the river, home to woodcutters, furriers, and a substantial noyja community, while the wide streets on higher ground host the famous monster market and the attendant merchant houses, well-stocked inns, and alchemy shops. The evening before the next market day, the party dines with [Jela Drask](<../../../people/other-humans/jela-drask.md>), a member of the [Rodnya Nivik](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-nivik.md>). She is curious, especially about [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), having never met an [elf](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>), and shares some broad details about the [Rodnya](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya.md>), primarily emphasizing that while the Rodnya are never in open conflict, there is competition for status. After a series of dragon attacks last winter that were mismanaged by [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>), they are particularly low status at the moment. 

Before departing [Zvervinka](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/zvervinka.md>), the party acquires new magic from the monster market, in exchange for their dragon and ice worm treasure, and also speaks again with [Lena Sorokina](<../../../people/other-humans/lena-sorokina.md>), from whom they acquire their travel papers. Lena advises them to always keep their travel papers, and also to be careful as they get further west, as the giant bats of the vampire lord [Rhodar von Glauer](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/rhodar-von-glauer.md>) are dangerous. But, she mentions, negotiations are underway that should see peace on the western borders soon. 

Departing [Zvervinka](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/zvervinka.md>) on April 20th, the party joins a merchant caravan led by [Karel](<../../../people/other-humans/karel.md>), traveling south along the main road, muddy albeit passable. Over the next few days, they continued their journey, eventually reaching [Volya](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/volya.md>), a small trading post where they parted ways with [Karel](<../../../people/other-humans/karel.md>). From here, the party turned west, following the [Leis](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/leis.md>) to the outskirts of [Vedmakov](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/vedmakov.md>), and then across the [Dalinka](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/dalinka.md>) river valley to [Yamgov](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/yamgov.md>). The party approached the Voknaz Manor on May 1st, when they camped about 20 miles away. That evening, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) dreamed of [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), slowing destroying the bonds that hold him in his tomb. 

The afternoon of the following day, the party arrived at Voknaz Manor, the headquarters of the [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>). Here, they were greeted by a serving woman, and led to rooms prepared for them, to get ready for dinner with [Branek Mirov](<../../../people/other-humans/branek-mirov.md>). During dinner, he proposed a mission to the party, which they could undertake in exchange for the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../treasure/gifts-and-heirlooms/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>) possessed by the [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>): bring the body of the dead leader of the [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>) to the [Frostfell](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/frostfell.md>), quench the elemental fire burning in his chest at one of the frost pools, and resurrect him. After some discussion about the dangers of the [Frostfell](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/frostfell.md>), the party agreed, making plans to meet Branek the next morning and enter the portal to [Frostfell](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/frostfell.md>). 

In the pre-dawn hours, the party was awakened by an invisible visitor, whom the party eventually deduces was [Olen Vrask](<../../../people/other-humans/olen-vrask.md>), the scribe at dinner. He speaks of Urskan politics: Rodnya Kinzal, currently among the most prominent and powerful of the [Rodnya](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya.md>), is seeking to make peace with [Rhodar von Glauer](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/rhodar-von-glauer.md>), the lord of the vampire kingdom on the west. [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>) and many others have long opposed this, fearing the consequences of allowing a vampire lord to become comfortably established on the western border of [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>). But, with [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>) in disgrace, something dramatic is needed. The invisible man proposes that the party, instead of going to the [Frostfell](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/frostfell.md>), heads west and kills [Rhodar von Glauer](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/rhodar-von-glauer.md>), eliminating the possibility of negotiations and hopefully providing ammunition to upend Urskan politics. If they do this, Olen says, he will orchestrate control of the [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>), and give them the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../treasure/gifts-and-heirlooms/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>). 

After some discussion, we end as the party decides that, despite the risks of killing the vampire, it is better for the world and for [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>) to attempt this.

## Narrative

We begin in [Uzgukhar](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>), at the celebration of the victory in the [Battle for Uzgukhar](<../../../events/1700s/1749/battle-for-uzgukhar.md>), after the unveiling of the statue of the hero [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) in the Plaza of Freedom. The party, and especially [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), are hailed as heroes and saviors, and the mood of relief and hope is palpable, overlaid on the mourning for those lost. As the evening progresses, Loremaster [Azogar](<../../../people/orcs/azogar.md>) stands and in his frail but strong voice, speaks the full story of the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>). 

*He tells of the first days of the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>), before there was a cloak. He tells of Ilios the Bright, who fell through the world when he was just an infant, not yet chained to [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s will, and grew strong in the [fey](<../../../species/children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>) realm of [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), under a sunset sky free of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s influence. Ilios, it is said, had a [fey](<../../../species/children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>) energy that could not be contained. His eyes shone with moonlight, and his swords flashed silver. He began to raid across the foothills of the [Sentinels](<../../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), where small, disorganized groups of [orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), families and tribes hidden from the Drankorian patrols lived. Ilios stole the unchained babies from these tribes, and brought them to [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), where The [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) grew in secret, protected by the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>).* 

*And then Azagar speaks of the blackness that tore out the sun, the rift through which darkness leaked. The invasion of [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>) by a far distant evil, something of no world. Ilios leapt through this blackness and severed
the cords that held this rift open, trapping himself to an unknown fate, but saving [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>). In honor of his sacrifice, the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>) wove the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>), each thread plucked from the immortal sunsets of [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), each thread grasping the essence of the Riving, the long pause, the splitting of the planes that created the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), and wrapping that energy of pulling, separating into a cloak that cut the wearer from the divine.*

*[Azogar](<../../../people/orcs/azogar.md>)'s voice shifts, and he tells the story of the days in the world when the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) ventured forth, the quiet days, living lives of fields and flowers. In the story of their history, this was a remembered time of peace and happiness, but it could not last, for [Azogar](<../../../people/orcs/azogar.md>) turns to the tale of [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>), and [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>).* 

*[Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>), it is said, traveled among the [orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), teaching them, preaching the fate he sought for all the people of the world: freedom from the divine, as the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) had found. But then betrayal, whether intentional or not, telling [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) of the dream, of the cloak. And then the war, and loss, and defeat as [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) turned on the [orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) and stole the cloak. That this because [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>)'s downfall, as [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) turned on his former ally, was no comfort, and [Azogar](<../../../people/orcs/azogar.md>) speaks bitter words as he tells how the cloak was lost and the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) scattered to hide in small groups where they could. 

*Until, after the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the hero [Uzgash](<../../../people/orcs/uzgash.md>) found the cloak unexpectedly amongst the ruins of a Dunmari fort, and with the cloak proclaimed the safe haven of [Xurkhaz](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), the land of the rising sun, a beacon of hope for the scattered [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>).* 

For the next few days, the party rests in [Uzgukhar](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>), giving time for [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) to recover from his death, and taking a well-deserved breather after the battle. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) marks the Dunmari new year, the 192nd year of the [Nayan Dynasty](<../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/nayan-dynasty.md>), on January 23rd, beginning to develop his own new traditions of meditation and worship. As they prepare to leave, to head west to reconnect with Pava and [Avaras](<../../../people/dunmari/avaras.md>) and perhaps recruit [Amil](<../../../people/dunmari/amil.md>) to join their crew, two orc women approach, [Nuzkar](<../../../people/orcs/nuzkar.md>) and [Aygul](<../../../people/orcs/aygul.md>), asking to join the crew. That day, January 24th, is an uneventful day of travel over the [Garamjala Desert](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>). 

The next day, January 25th, the party receives another message from the [Philosopher's Guild](<../../../groups/tollen-guilds/ancient-and-honorable-guild-of-philosophers.md>), concerning [Rai's hand](<../treasure/gifts-and-heirlooms/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>). The [message](<../letters-notes-and-tales/philosopher-s-information-concerning-rai-s-hand.md>) is strange. After discussing the message for a short time, the party finds themselves passing over the now-empty city of [Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>), once Grash's base, and decides to investigate. [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) sees this as a perfect opportunity to be allowed to fly [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), but the party is not quite ready to allow this, it seems.

[Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) seems relatively quiet. The party explores the palace, which was once Grash's headquarters, but now seems abandoned. The stables and great hall are ruined and cleared out; further searching uncovers a few restless haunted spirits of the plague dead in the old kitchens, which are easily dispatched. The remains of Grash's looting operation are also in the palace, along with a few treasures missed or destroyed. The most informative find is what looks like a planning room, with a map table and slate to draw on. It has been smashed, but from the available pieces and clues it seems pretty clear that [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) was planning on attacking [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) had he succeeded in getting the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>). 

Exploring the rest of the city, the party casually slays a few more specters, and stumbles across the library, which is now a giant wasp nest, but the wasps are immediately destroyed by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s sickening radiance spell. Although most of the paper has been shredded and turned to giant wasp nesting material, something might be salvageable, and it is packed for transport to [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>) where perhaps [Nuzkar](<../../../people/orcs/nuzkar.md>) will see what she can decipher from it. The party also briefly explores the orc warren, which is empty, but the central building contains a series of gruesome murals depicting [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) is battle, slaughtering defenseless innocents as the avatar of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>).   

The next morning, on January 26th, the party briefly returns to [Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) with the orcs [Nuzkar](<../../../people/orcs/nuzkar.md>) and [Aygul](<../../../people/orcs/aygul.md>). [Nuzkar](<../../../people/orcs/nuzkar.md>) is deeply saddened by the orc warren, mourning the hundreds of orcs who must have been born and bound to [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>) here, and asks the party to burn it all. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), as the orc warren burns, cleanse the spirits of the place as well, and see not just the orcs, but many others, especially the Dunmari who died in the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), trapped between the plague consuming [Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) and a wall of fire summoned to prevent them from reaching the safety of the [Monastery of Bhishma](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/monastery-of-bhishma.md>) nearby. As the fire burns, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) feels [Bhishma](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/bhishma.md>)'s hand freeing the trapped, lost souls still stuck here, and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) briefly sees again the [river of souls](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/proximate-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>) where he spent an hour before being resurrected by [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s magic. 

That afternoon, before departing [Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>), the party looks at the [broken Dunmari sword](<../mirror-visions/broken-dunmari-sword-vision.md>) in [The Mirror of the Past](<../treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/the-mirror-of-the-past.md>). The next day the party travels west, and arrives at [Pava and Avaras' House](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/pava-and-avaras-house.md>) on January 28th. Here, they meet [Kethra](<../../../people/dwarves/kethra.md>), a dwarven smith and great-grandaughter of [Nora Silverspark](<../../../people/dwarves/nora-silverspark.md>), who has traveled far searching for [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), hoping she'll be her mentor. They also speak at length with [Pava](<../../../people/dunmari/pava.md>) and [Avaras](<../../../people/dunmari/avaras.md>), who are very happy to see everyone looking so well. [Pava](<../../../people/dunmari/pava.md>) wishs to record [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s story, and is amazed at how [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) has started to reinterpret and expand the [Bhishma](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/bhishma.md>) traditions of storytelling in new ways, asking if [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) would take [Amil](<../../../people/dunmari/amil.md>) with him as an apprentice. The party spends the next day just catching up and resting at [Pava and Avaras' House](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/pava-and-avaras-house.md>).

As they prepare to leave on January 30th, with [Amil](<../../../people/dunmari/amil.md>) and [Kethra](<../../../people/dwarves/kethra.md>) joining the crew of [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), [Pava](<../../../people/dunmari/pava.md>) updates them on the situation in [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), between [Sura](<../../../people/dunmari/sura.md>) and [Nayan Karnas](<../../../people/dunmari/nayan-karnas.md>). We end as the party considers intervening.

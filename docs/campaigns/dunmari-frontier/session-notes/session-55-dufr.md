## Narrative
We begin as the party returns to the [Forest of Nightmares](<../../../gazetteer/far-north/forest-of-nightmares.md>), heading for the Battle of Endless Dark. Approaching the battlefield, the party finds a maze of trees and thickets, completely in magical darkness. At the center of the maze, the party finds a skeleton of a giant, a portal to a shadow realm, and the ghost of the giant. He calls himself [Zegron](<../../../people/historical-figures/zegron.md>), and he is hoping the party is here to punish those who fled, cowardly, from their duty in battle. Apparently this giant was in [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s army, and is angry with the Hobgoblins still hiding in the shadow realm, who would not fight. 

The party agrees to go into the shadow realm to fight the Hobgoblins, hoping perhaps to free [Taraka](<../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/taraka.md>) as well. Emerging into a flat, featureless plain of shadow, the party sees a small group of Hobgoblins who seem to be watching the portal, and in the distance, a much larger army that seems to be constantly chasing campfires that blink in and out in the darkness. The party struggles to defeat the organized hobgoblin attack, led by a wizard, low on spells but still dangerous, flying above the battlefield. Nonetheless eventually the Hobgoblins are killed. The wizard commander is missing an arm, and with it the [Cha'mutte’s Shadow Armband](<../treasure/notable-items/cha-muttes-shadow-armband.md>) he carried, presuambly. 

Exiting the portal, the party speaks with [Zegron](<../../../people/historical-figures/zegron.md>), who thanks them for dealing with the traitors, and indicates where to dig to find the wizard's arm as he vanishes. Digging up the arm, the party is faced with a dilemma. Destroying the armband would free [Taraka](<../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/taraka.md>), but also the large hobgoblin army trapped with them. Eventually, they devise a plan to send in [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) to attempt to banish both [Taraka](<../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/taraka.md>) and himself back to the material plane, leaving the Hobgoblins trapped, and then close the portal here by attuning to the armband. Amazingly, the plan works, and both [Taraka](<../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/taraka.md>) and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) make it back.

After a brief rest, the group then heads for the final battlefield, the Battle of Ye'mote. The battlefield is on the banks of the [Yemo'te](<../../../gazetteer/far-north/yemo-te.md>) river. A broken bridge crosses the river, and forest is littered with signs of an ancient battlefield: small mounds where the plants have grown over dead bodies, bits of rusting armor and weapons sticking from the ground, white filaments of fungus wrapping many of the bodies in cocoons. 

Across the river the party can see the rotted body of a hobgoblin warlock, with a shadow armband. As they move to approach, hoards of undead attack. The relentless swarms of undead fall easily in battle, but they seem to be endless, until [Aristaea](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/aristaea.md>) strikes the warlock down with a critical strike of divine energy. As the undead fall away, [Iascaire](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/iascaire.md>) destroys the last armband, freeing [Midri](<../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/midri.md>) and [K'onisati](<../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/k-onisati.md>). 

We end as the party returns to the [Ko'zula](<../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/northern-tribes/ko-zula.md>) village to celebrate, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) bids farewell to [Iascaire](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/iascaire.md>) and [Aristaea](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/aristaea.md>).

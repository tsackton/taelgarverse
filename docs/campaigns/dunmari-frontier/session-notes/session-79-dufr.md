## Narrative
We begin as the battle ends, and the party collects and sorts through the gear from [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) and company. [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>), and the sorcerer [Evelina](<../../../people/chardonians/evelina.md>), lie dead on the ground: [Evelina](<../../../people/chardonians/evelina.md>) killed in battle, [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) executed afterward. The remainder of the enemies are trapped in the mirror, after having been put to sleep by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s magic. After tending to [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>), [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) turns to [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) to try to remove whatever icy curse clings to him, despite [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s insistence he is fine. However, normal restoration magic does not seem remove the curse - instead, it just makes it briefly visible, as a small icy flying gargoyle-like creature clinging to [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s back. Something of ice is needed to drag the curse away from [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>). [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) attempts to banish it with his sword, but as it is fey, not a fiend, this has no effect. Deciding this is a problem for the morning, the party rests, planning to interrogate the prisoners in the morning.

The next morning, the party has a late breakfast with [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>), [Murook](<../../../people/orcs/murook.md>), and [Azogar](<../../../people/orcs/azogar.md>). They report the recent news, that [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) has begun slaughtering his army, seeking to turn them into undead. There is some discussion of the metaphysics of this situation, and whether the undead are still bound by [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>) and thus unable to enter [Xurkhaz](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), but ultimately it seems the risen [orc](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) zombies are a more serious threat than [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>) anticipated. Several options, including protecting the city from undead with [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s magic while those who can flee, are discussed.

The party then interrogates the prisoners, starting with [Valius](<../../../people/chardonians/valius.md>), the archer twin. After his cell is combined with [Vargus](<../../../people/chardonians/vargus.md>)', his twin brother, [Valius](<../../../people/chardonians/valius.md>) begins to speak in response to [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s patient questions. He speaks of how he and his brother were mercenaries after they left the [Chardonian Legion](<../../../groups/chardonian-organizations/chardonian-legion.md>), traveling around, searching for a rumored lost dragon treasure in the mountains on the border of the [Mawakel Peninsula](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>), that kind of thing. But they were always more inclined to drink and eat and talk at pubs than actually find treasure, and eventually broke they ended up back in [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), signing up to hunt for treasure for the [Society of the Open Scroll](<../../../groups/chardonian-organizations/society-of-the-open-scroll.md>). After a few successful trips, [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) sought them out, paying well but always pushing them to be a little more ruthless. When [Vargus](<../../../people/chardonians/vargus.md>) tried to get out, [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) did something to him, with this cold iron crown, the [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>). From them on, [Valius](<../../../people/chardonians/valius.md>) did what [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) said, to keep his brother alive. Eventually, they were sent with the sorcerer [Evelina](<../../../people/chardonians/evelina.md>) to travel east, looking for old artifacts from [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), ending up in the [Orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>)' territory, spying and scouting. From [Valius](<../../../people/chardonians/valius.md>), the party also learns a little more about [The Cleansed](<../../../groups/the-cleansed.md>). Their memories and personalities are not gone, just suspended: occasionally [Vargus](<../../../people/chardonians/vargus.md>) would have lucid moments, and talk about it feeling like a fog had lifted, but then the mists would close in again. 

Next, the party talks to [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>). It is clear after talking to her for a few minutes that she quite dislikes [orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) and undead, and believes that [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) is destined to be restored to greatness. [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>) does not know that [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) is undead; she clearly believes that finding the cloak, scepter, and crown is all required to restore him to life, to resurrect him. She believes that [Vargus](<../../../people/chardonians/vargus.md>), [Vola](<../../../people/chardonians/vola.md>), and [Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>) volunteered to be purified, cleansed of their impure blood, and the process went wrong. She believes [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) is working to fix the process, to make it safe, so all humans can be cleansed and purified for the new dawn of the [Drankorian Empire](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>). It takes some time, but eventually [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) convinces her that [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) is a trapped undead and [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) seeks to free him, not resurrect him. This seems to shatter her resistance, and she tells the party what she knows. [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) has presumably spoken via Sending with [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>), and is likely on his way to attack the city. He suspects the party has the [Scepter of Command](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/scepter-of-command.md>), from talking to dead werewolves outside [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), and if he gets the cloak and the scepter, [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) can return in full power. The party agrees to leave her in the mirror for a year or two, and possibly release her in exile in the north, near [Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/northern-frontier/voltara.md>), when [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) and [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) are dead.

After some discussion, it is decided that [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) will remain and defend the city from the undead, with her divine magic, while the rest of the party flies north to destroy the scepter, preventing [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) from ever obtaining it. With this decided, the party speaks with [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>), who is dismissive and rude, insisting he will be rescued when [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) comes, up until the minute he is slain. 

Finally, as the days passes noon, the party looks at the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) in [Mirror of the Past](<../treasure/notable-items/mirror-of-the-past.md>), seeing the [Mantle of Protection Vision](<../mirror-visions/mantle-of-protection-vision.md>). Then, [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) begins casting the Hallow spell, to bless the throne room, which takes 24 hours. The next day, as the spell casting is done, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is reluctantly dragged into the room, freeing him of the fey curse of ice. 

We end as [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) sets herself to casting Forbiddance, and the rest of the party turns north on [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>) to destroy the scepter.

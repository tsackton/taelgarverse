## Narrative
Our session begins in Apollyon's temple, as the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) recovers from [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>)'s initial attacks. After Apollyon’s retreat into his inner sanctum, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), just revived by [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s magic, leads a _Prayer of Healing_, restoring the group’s strength and offering a brief reprieve. While the party recovers, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) investigates the side chapels, uncovering relics of Apollyon’s failed ascension to godhood, and finding a loose floor tile concealing a hidden staircase near the central altar. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)’s _Ghostly Gaze_ reveals an undercrypt filled with construction debris and tools, with stairs leading even further down.

The group pries open the concealed staircase, descending into the undercrypt. The pitch-dark space is littered with remnants of unfinished construction. As the chalyte knight takes point, he inadvertently triggers a trap, leaving him hearing chanting words of praise to [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) in Drankorian, but Riswynn’s magic dispels it before the rest of the party proceeds. A scrying sensor materializes, indicating that Apollyon is aware of their movements.

---

The party’s descent leads them to a chamber illuminated by greenish _Continual Flame_ torches. Carved iconography of worshippers in reverence lines the walls, and an open corridor reveals sarcophagi in the next area. The chalyte knight, taking lead again, is momentarily dominated by magic, begins chanting in Drankorian and kneeling in praise to Apollyon before breaking free as spectral undead rise from the sarcophagi to attack. The party charges into the room, risking the traps to take on the undead spirits. 

[Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), resting the effects of Apollyon's trap, raises her holy symbol of the [Bahrazel](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>) and incinerates the majority of the undead, leaving about fifteen for the others to dispatch. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) briefly succumbs to the magical compulsion to worship Apollyon, but quickly shakes the effect, and with [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) clears additional enemies with powerful strikes and spells, while [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) provides precise support with his bow. After the battle, they find remnants of cremated remains in the sarcophagi and discover another staircase leading deeper underground.

Descending further, the group enters a small chamber with a side corridor leading to a larger room containing chained columns and a sarcophagus. Despite some debate, they decide to leave the side chamber unexplored for now, pressing onward to pursue Apollyon. Descending to the bottom level of the undertemple, the party finds a twisting, single-file passage lined with obsidian flooring that glows with a sickly green light. The party proceeds cautiously, the atmosphere growing heavier with each step.

---

At the end of the narrow passage, the party emerges into Apollyon’s inner sanctum, a vaulted chamber illuminated by an eerie green glow. Four rune-covered pillars inscribed with glowing symbols dominate the space. At the far end, [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) sits on a throne, opposite a bone table bearing a glowing green crystal orb. He greets the group with mockery, proclaiming, “I’ve been waiting. Are you ready to surrender for the glory of Apollyon?”

The final battle begins. Kenzo charges, activating Lengua’s claw and unleashing a series of strikes, but Apollyon’s shimmering force armor absorbs much of the damage. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) prepare defensive spells, while [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) positions the construct for strategic advantage. [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) teleports across the room, avoiding Kenzo’s melee reach, and unleashes necrotic energy bolts. The party’s swift reactions mitigate some of the damage.

Seeker counters with a powerful _Erupting Earth_, creating difficult terrain and dealing significant damage, though [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) twists the magic to unleash necrotic backlash. The animated [ladder](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/companions/ladder.md>) grabs the glowing orb from the bone table, attempting to smash it, but its magical integrity holds. [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) commands [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) to die, but Delwath’s _Death Ward_ activates, protecting him and unleashing radiant light from the [Bahrazel](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>), which temporarily unsettles Apollyon.

Spectral guardians emerge from the rune-covered pillars, forming a defensive barrier around [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) and absorbing incoming attacks. Riswynn summons a radiant cylinder of light, dealing heavy damage to Apollyon while healing allies. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) exploits openings in Apollyon’s defenses, landing critical hits that visibly weaken him. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) uses _Catapult_ to hurl the glowing orb at Apollyon, further disrupting his composure.

---

As the battle rages, [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) transforms into mist, retreating briefly. The glowing runes on the floor fade as energy surges back into him, restoring his vitality. The party redoubles their efforts, with [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) forcing [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) to shatter a pillar to protect himself from another _Erupting Earth_. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>)’s Skaer arrows strike true, and [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)’s unarmed strikes push Apollyon to the brink, despite the retaliatory damage from his necrotic aura.

Apollyon’s necrotic tendrils lash out, restraining several party members. His teleportation keeps him elusive, but the group finally corners him. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) channels celestial energy into a critical smite, delivering massive damage that causes cracks to form across Apollyon’s form. In a final act of desperation, [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) unleashes a wave of necrotic energy, knocking Seeker unconscious and nearly doing the same to [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>). The animated ladder, under Apollyon's command, moves to strike the unconscious [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>).

[Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), relentless, delivers a series of unarmed strikes that further weaken [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>). [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) lands the killing blow, channeling a blast of eldritch force guided by the spirits of the [Tanshi](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/tanshi/tanshi.md>).  Apollyon’s body disintegrates into moonlight, as the spirit of [Yezali](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/tanshi/meswati/yezali.md>) guides the killing blow, and the remaining pillars collapse, marking the end of his reign.

---

As the sanctum begins to crumble, the party scrambles to escape. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) revives Seeker with _Healing Word_, and Seeker teleports the group and the ladder (still holding the glowing orb) to the temple’s main level. The party confirms no immediate threats remain, and Kenzo uses his ki sense to ensure the temple is free of undead.

Over the next several days, the walls of Apollyon’s prison weaken and collapse. The party communicates with allies, learning of significant developments:

- In [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), the Chardonian army retreats from [Songara](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/songara.md>), though their navy secures a victory near [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>). [Mitus Verina Auratan](<../../../people/chardonians/mitus-verina-auratan.md>) enters Darba, while negotiations with [Karnas](<../../../people/dunmari/nayan-karnas.md>) about the [Nayan Floodplains](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/nayan-floodplains.md>) continue.

- In [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), the chalyte trade faces growing disruption due to strikes and sabotage.

As May 30th dawns, the Cha'mutte's ancient prison designed to trap Apollyon finally collapses, and the party uses the Rainbow Bridge to return to _Vindristjarna_. There, they reunite with their crew and begin deliberating their next steps, with the Crown of Purity’s legacy weighing heavily on their minds. After [viewing the Crown in the Mirror of the Past](<../mirror-visions/crown-of-purity-vision.md>), the party debates what to do with it:

- **Delwath** sees it as a tool for good and argues for wielding it to bring peace.
- **Kenzo** insists on its destruction, fearing its corrupting potential.
- **Wellby** advocates for removing it from existence, viewing it as a dangerous artifact.
- **Seeker** suggests entrusting it to a long-lived entity for safekeeping.
- **Riswynn** proposes temporary stewardship to address immediate crises before ensuring its ultimate safety.

The session ends on the evening of May 30th, the final fate of the crown, and the party's next steps, unresolved. 

## Detailed Summary

### The Tomb of Apollyon
- After Apollyon flees, the party regroups in the temple; Delwath, visibly shaken from his recent death, begins a *Prayer of Healing* to recover hit points and offer a short rest to the group.
- While Delwath and others recuperate, Wellby investigates the side chapels, finding monuments and incomplete memorials to Apollyon's rule and attempted ascension to godhood, as well as a loose floor tile concealing a staircase leading down to an undercrypt.

- The larger chamber contains two columns with chains and a sarcophagus, reminiscent of Delwath’s earlier scrying.
- The group debates exploring the side chamber versus continuing their descent to pursue Apollyon directly; they decide to press on, leaving the side chamber unexplored for now.
- The party arrives at a narrow passageway lined with patterned obsidian flooring that glows with a sickly green light.
- The passage twists and turns, requiring single-file traversal.


### Apollyon’s Inner Sanctum

- Riswynn and Delwath prepare their spells and defensive measures while Seeker positions the construct strategically.
- Apollyon teleports across the room, avoiding Kenzo’s melee reach.
- He unleashes necrotic energy bolts targeting multiple party members, but several save successfully, minimizing the damage.
- Seeker casts *Erupting Earth* at 6th level, creating difficult terrain and dealing significant damage to Apollyon, despite absorbing the necrotic backlash as Apollyon twists and attempts to counter the magic.
- The animated ladder picks up the glowing crystal orb from the bone table and attempts to smash it, but the orb’s magical integrity prevents destruction by force alone.
- Apollyon commands Delwath to die, but Delwath’s *Death Ward* activates, thwarting the attempt and unleashing radiant light and the protection of the [Bahrazel](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>), that temporarily unsettles Apollyon.
- Protective spirits emerge from the rune-covered pillars, forming a defensive barrier around Apollyon and absorbing attacks directed at him.
- Riswynn summons a radiant cylinder of light, dealing heavy damage to Apollyon while simultaneously healing allies.
- Kenzo uses unarmed strikes to exploit Apollyon’s weaknesses, landing critical hits that visibly shake him.
- Seeker uses a *Catapult* spell to hurl the glowing orb directly at Apollyon, dealing damage and disrupting his composure.
- Apollyon, though visibly wounded, unleashes a wave of canceling magic, limiting the party’s spellcasting and magical item use.


### Apollyon's Last Stand
- Apollyon transforms into mist, retreating briefly. The glowing runes on the floor between the pillars fade, as energy surges back into Apollyon, restoring him to full health.
- The party continues their sustained assault, with Seeker forcing Apollyon to shatter a pillar to protect himself from another *Erupting Earth*, and Wellby striking true with his Skaer arrows.

- Kenzo delivers a series of unarmed strikes, weakening Apollyon significantly.
- Delwath lands the killing blow, a blast of eldritch force guided by celestial spirits. Apollyon’s body disintegrates into moonlight, and the remaining pillars collapse.


### Aftermath and Reflection
- As Apollyon fades, the sanctum begins to crumble. The party must escape while ensuring no one is left behind in the chaos. Seeker, revived by Delwath's *Healing Word*, teleports the party and the ladder (carrying the glowing orb) to the main level of the temple. 
- The group searches for any signs of remaining threats or allies. They confirm no immediate danger remains; Kenzo uses his ki sense to ensure no undead presence lingers within the temple.
- The party waits for several days, as the walls of Apollyon's prison, now binding them to the temple, weaken and fall. 
- During the wait in the temple, the party communicates with Sura in Dunmar, and with various Chardonians via the Crown of Purity. 
	- In Dunmar, the Chardonian army is retreating from [Songara](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/songara.md>), but the Chardonian navy has won a great victory outside Darba, and [Mitus Verina Auratan](<../../../people/chardonians/mitus-verina-auratan.md>) has entered the city. 
	- Negotiations are underway with [Karnas](<../../../people/dunmari/nayan-karnas.md>) about the fate of the Nayan Floodplains and the city of Darba. 
	- In Chardon, the chalyte trade is seeing signs of disruption, with strikes and sabotage spreading across Chardon.
- Riswynn remains attuned to the crown, using its influence to push back against the chalyte trade and ensure peace between Dunmar and Chardon. 
- Concerns about the crown’s long-term impact resurface, with the party agreeing to revisit its fate after they regroup.
- On the morning of May 30th, as the prison cracks open, the party uses the Rainbow Bridge to return to Vindristjarna. 


### The Crown’s Legacy and Dilemmas
-  On Vindristjarna, the group greats their crew and discusses the implications of their victory over Apollyon, focusing on what to do with the crown.
- Deliberation begins on whether the crown should be destroyed, hidden, or wielded to enact good.
- The crown, removed from the [Portable Hole](<../treasure/portable-hole.md>), has transformed from its previous state into a fine silver tiara adorned with dwarvish runes, seven points symbolizing the [Bahrazel](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>), and gemstone motifs of hammers and forges.
- The party uses a magical mirror to delve into the crown’s history and purpose, seeing the [Crown of Purity Vision](<../mirror-visions/crown-of-purity-vision.md>)
- Debating what to do next with the crown, the party’s perspectives diverge:
	- **Delwath** argues for wielding the crown to bring peace and prosperity, seeing it as a missed opportunity if destroyed.
	- **Kenzo** supports destruction, wary of its corrupting potential and the temptation of power.
	- **Wellby** leans towards removing the crown from existence, seeing it as a dangerous artifact that disrupts the natural flow of history.
	- **Seeker** proposes entrusting the crown to a long-lived entity, such as a stone giant, to ensure its safekeeping for future generations.
	- **Riswynn** considers acting as the crown’s steward, using it temporarily to address immediate crises before ensuring its ultimate safety.
- The party decides to delay a final decision, acknowledging the weight of their choice and the potential consequences.
- Riswynn continues to hold the crown, while the group prepares to explore future paths and consult allies for guidance.

## Narrative
We start in combat, with the party fighting the shadow hunter and his shadow dogs. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), mostly drained of spells, turns into a Huge Giant Crab for the fight, which sadly does not last long. While [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) deals with the dogs, and [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) flees due to the magical fear effect, the shadow hunter knocks [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) unconscious and begins to flee with him, until saved by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) and banishing smite. 

After the battle, the party watches as the mask falls off the face of the shadow hunter, and in death he shifts to a normal human, looking pale and gaunt. As he dies, he warns or threatens the party that there are many more chalyte zombies in [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) and it will not take long for [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) to make more hunters. Before sleeping, the party looks at the mask in [Mirror of the Past](<../treasure/mirror-of-the-past.md>), seeing a [vision of its past](<../mirror-visions/shadow-hunter-s-mask-vision.md>).

Over the next two days, the party makes their way to [Arendum](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/arendum.md>), arriving late at night and taking rooms at the [Laughing Wolf Inn](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/laughing-wolf-inn.md>), outside the gates. The next day – the first of September – the party spends in [Arendum](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/arendum.md>), getting information and planting rumors, and sending letters back to the people they met in [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), warning them of [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>). From their time in [Arendum](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/arendum.md>), they get the sense there is tension between the Chardonians and the Deno’qai: there are no Deno’qai in the town, and it feels like the town is organized around defense. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) buys supplies for a journey north, and spreads rumors about heading to the [Dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) and then over the mountains to [Sembara](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>).

The next day, the party heads north, before turning east and south at the confluence with the [Kayan](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/kayan.md>) river, turning invisible as they depart the [Chasa](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/chasa.md>). For the next two days, the party travels along the [Kayan](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/kayan.md>), invisible, passing pastures and dairy farmers, the occasional forester, and a Chardonian patrol returning from the eave of the woods. Traveling slowly to maintain invisibility during daylight, it takes two days to get into the depths of the [Elderwood](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>). 

By September 4th, the party is deep in the woods, following the [Kayan](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/kayan.md>) river under the eaves of the giant redwoods of the forest. Around mid-morning, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) begins straying from the path along the river, his staff seeming to lead him deeper into the woods. Deciding to follow, the party arrives as a massive clearing, at least 400 feet across. In the center stands a huge tree, towering over the forest itself, stretching maybe 400 feet into the sky, with a 50 foot diameter trunk. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), drawn to the tree, goes into a trance, becoming one with the forest itself, feeling his perception extend and merge with the network of trees, experiencing the forest as a web of relationships between ancient entities. As [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) goes deeper in this trance, he touches something sour, an acidic corruption covered by a sickly sweet taste. Trying to probe deeper into the corruption, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) is ejected from his trance, dazed. 

Meanwhile, the rest of the party has encountered a patrol from a Deno’qai village, led by [Zevi of the Bek'eni](<../../../people/deno-qai/zevi-of-the-bek-eni.md>), a warrior from the [Bek'eni](<../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/bek-eni.md>) tribe. He questions why they are in the [Bek'eni](<../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/bek-eni.md>) forest, wonders at the behavior of [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), and asks the party to come with his band of warriors to their village, to meet [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>), an [Elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) who has been advising and aiding the [Bek'eni](<../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/bek-eni.md>) for the past 10 years. The party agrees to go, helps [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) stand and walk, and heads 5 miles east with the [Bek'eni](<../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/bek-eni.md>).

Arriving at the village, the party meets [Zaro](<../../../people/deno-qai/zaro.md>), the chief of the village, and [Itar](<../../../people/deno-qai/itar.md>), the Godcaller. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) is treated like a lord, offered a place of honor at dinner, while the rest of the party is relegated to meager accommodations. [Zaro](<../../../people/deno-qai/zaro.md>) and especially [Itar](<../../../people/deno-qai/itar.md>) talk a lot about [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>), saying he is expected in the next couple of days and he will be eager to meet [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>). [Itar](<../../../people/deno-qai/itar.md>) knows little about the tanshi, but is eager to talk about [elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) and [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>), and dresses in an imitation of the elven style. The party learns that [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>) is trying to deal with the corruption of the [Te'kula](<../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/te-kula.md>), and has been taking villagers from the [Bek'eni](<../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/bek-eni.md>) and training them for this purpose. The party goes to sleep, a little suspicious of [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>) but also eager to meet another [Elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>), especially [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>). 

The next morning, while [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) is discussing his experience with the God tree (having been incoherent the day before), [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) catches a woman, apparently not well-treated by the tribe, listening in. She introduces herself as [Theba](<../../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>), the former Godcaller, ousted by [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>). She tries to convince the party to help her recover her magic gear, taken by [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>) (who claimed it belonged to the tribe, not her), and then flee with her to investigate what is really going on with the [Te'kula](<../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/te-kula.md>) (she offers to guide the party if they help her recover her stuff). [Theba](<../../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>) tells them of another [Elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>), [Belegor](<../../../people/elves/belegor.md>), who stayed for a while and then vanished after speaking with [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>), and does not want the party to suffer that fate. 

Suspicious but not swayed, the party goes to the God tree. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) scries [Belegor](<../../../people/elves/belegor.md>) from a drawing [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) makes based on [Theba](<../../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>)’s description, but the scry fails. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) communes more with the God tree, reaching out and feeling two [elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) in the forest (one here, one to the south), which the party assumes are [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>) and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), despite learning that [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>) is supposed to come from the East. 

After returning to the [Bek'eni](<../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/bek-eni.md>) village, the party debates what to do. Still uncertain, they decide to at least get [Theba](<../../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>)’s gear for her. Clairvoyance reveals the layout of the house, and a basement with a small treasure pile (including [Theba](<../../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>)’s gear), plus two things that look like patrolling clouds of poisonous gas. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) scouts and encounters large poisonous snakes hiding in the trees, and learns the two statues by the front door are magic and probably trapped. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) dimension door into the stairs to the basement, where [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) dashes to grab [Theba](<../../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>)’s gear (taking an attack from the poison cloud), and then both [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) flee with teleportation magic. 

That night, the party decides in the morning they will meet [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>) by the God tree, but be ready for a fight. The next morning, the chief [Zaro](<../../../people/deno-qai/zaro.md>) is reluctant to let them leave for the God tree until [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) uses Suggestion on him. The party then proceeds to the God tree to wait for [Mezzar](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>).

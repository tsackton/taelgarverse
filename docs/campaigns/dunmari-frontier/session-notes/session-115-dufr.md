## Narrative
Our session begins as [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) return to the Temple of the Eight Divines, weary but determined. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) greets them, having kept a vigilant watch over the phylactery—the dagger containing Apollyon’s soul. Together, the group recounts their recent exploits, including their perilous exploration of the Laughing Wave tavern and the Customs House.

Wellby’s news of the broader world casts a shadow over their accomplishments. Sura’s forces in Dunmar face relentless assaults by Chardonian legions and shadowy assassins. Vindristjarna, their airship, may be at risk, and Fausto, their long-time nemesis, remains a looming threat. Still, the party resolves to stay the course, focusing on the phylactery and the Land of the Dead as the most effective way to end Apollyon’s threat.

Using an arrow of pathfinding shot from his magical bow, Wellby locates the University of the Blessed Waters, a mile southeast of the temple. A path only visible to him leads through the jungle and ruins, and the party prepares to follow, moving swiftly.

---

The path winds through overgrown streets and oppressive jungle terrain. Heavy rain begins to fall, and whispers and unnatural creaks emanate from the ruins they bypass, but the group presses on. Eventually, they reach an overgrown garden marked by two intact statues flanking the entrance to the University of the Blessed Waters. As they step into the garden, Kenzo notices the statues shift subtly, revealing their nature as animated guardians.

The battle begins as [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) charges one statue, only for it to teleport away, evading his strikes. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) summons a stone construct to aid in the fight, while [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)’s _Synaptic Static_ hampers the statues’ effectiveness. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) casts _Sunburst_, blinding both statues and dealing massive radiant damage, turning the tide of the battle. Despite their psychic attacks, which exploit the party’s emotional vulnerabilities, the statues are eventually overwhelmed, crumbling into rubble.

---

Inside the Faculty of Natural History, the ruins of the building tell a story of decay and abandonment. The structure’s floors are unstable, and a tree grows through its center, adding to the treacherous environment. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) senses a faint psychic connection to Minarith in the northwest corner. As they traverse the ruins, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) triggers a roof collapse but escapes with minor injuries. The group carefully climbs over rubble, reaching a row of offices. One, overgrown with vines and debris, bears the unmistakable signs of belonging to Minarith.

Inside, they discover a palm-sized wooden and metal bird, intricately carved with silver eyes and a marble body. The bird radiates faint transmutation magic and contains a hidden compartment. Inside the compartment, they find a tightly rolled piece of paper, a note written in Elvish and addressed to Maglar, reading: 

*"I hope this message finds you. I am trusting to luck and this magic trinket to bring this note to you. I finally... They're coming. I can hide no longer. I know not what will happen to me, but few, if any, of our people have survived the Ashen Cloaks. I thought maybe my unimportance might protect me, for who really cares about the study of plants when down the hall there is the study of great magics and fire, and the planes and the gods that can reshape reality themselves. But it was always the case, I guess, that he would never let any of our people survive, and I have nowhere left to flee. Run if you can."

Both the bird and the note resonate strongly with Minarith’s soul, marking them as vital mementos for the ritual to destroy the phylactery.

---

With all seven mementos secured, the party teleports to [Tollen](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), seeking guidance on the [Land of the Dead](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>) at the [Philosopher's Guild](<../../../groups/tollen-guilds/ancient-and-honorable-guild-of-philosophers.md>), where they arrive after [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s spell. The guild’s tranquil garden provides a stark contrast to the oppressive heat and rain of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>). Greeted by a middle-aged woman in white robes, the group explains their urgent need for information. In exchange for valuable magical items—the Watcher’s Dagger and Kadmos’s Rod of the Pact Keeper—the guild agrees to expedite their request, saying they will be summoned later that evening.

While waiting to be summoned to the [Philosopher's Guild](<../../../groups/tollen-guilds/ancient-and-honorable-guild-of-philosophers.md>), [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) seek out a body to be the focus of the _Plane Shift_ spell, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) consults with the elven ambassador from [Orenlas](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/orenlas.md>), [Melindir](<../../../people/elves/melindir.md>). Although [Melindir](<../../../people/elves/melindir.md>) cannot offer assistance to [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) directly, he does suggest contacting the [Stoneborn](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/stoneborn/stoneborn.md>), leading [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) to reach out to [Drikod](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/drikod.md>) in hopes of getting aid to [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) as soon as possible. Before parting, [Melindir](<../../../people/elves/melindir.md>) gifts [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) a vial of charm resistance, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) warns [Melindir](<../../../people/elves/melindir.md>) to be careful if their mission fails. 

Summoned to the [Philosopher's Guild](<../../../groups/tollen-guilds/ancient-and-honorable-guild-of-philosophers.md>), the party relinquishes their possessions and dons robes provided by the guild before entering a darkened chamber for the consultation. Blindfolded, they are seated on cold stone benches and addressed by a disembodied voice, which shares critical knowledge about the Land of the Dead:

- The realm saps the vitality of the living; food and water disintegrate, and wounds cannot heal.

- Time in the Land of the Dead erodes the connection between soul and body, making prolonged stays perilous.

- The plane moves travelers like a river, guiding souls to their destination. Interfering with this flow risks curses.

- The Giardi, guardians of the Land of the Dead, protect those with pure intentions and discern truth from deception.

- To free the seven bound souls, the party must provide them with context and clues to help them remember their identities and fates.

The voice gives parting advice to act swiftly and ensure they have the means to leave the Land of the Dead before its effects take hold. After speaking with the guild, the party rests for the night, preparing for the final leg of their journey: confronting Apollyon’s phylactery in the Land of the Dead.

---

The next morning, Riswynn casts _Plane Shift_, transporting the party to a gray, barren expanse where the horizon and sky blend indistinctly. Beside them, an elderly man—the soul of the recently deceased body used for the spell—appears, his focus fixed on a distant point as he walks away with purpose. The air is dry and lifeless, devoid of weather, contributing to an unsettling stillness.

The party lays the phylactery dagger on a cloth alongside the seven mementos. Shadowy figures, indistinct and fragmented, emerge and pace in a circular path around the dagger. Their forms lack definition, and their fragmented speech echoes in Drankorian, Elvish, and Common. In turn, the party seeks to free each one from the hold of Apollyon's Phylactery:

- **Seraphina Appleblossom:** [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) recounts tales of the Laughing Wave tavern, invoking the joy of fireworks on its roof. He bridges her connection to her past, helping her recall her name. Seraphina steps forward, smiling as she departs with the phrase, "There’s always another party to go to."

- **Minarith:** [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) mimics a curious student, engaging Minarith with botanical questions. His persuasive manner helps the peronar scholar remember his identity. Minarith departs with the words, "I see the stars," bowing gracefully.

- **Floria of Aphasium:** [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) speaks to Floria’s devotion to family and aiding others. Her heartfelt words evoke memories of Floria’s mission to care for the needy. Floria hears the call of The Father and vanishes, her surroundings subtly shifting.

- **Marius of Drankor:** [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) aligns Marius’s rebellion with his own struggles for justice, connecting with Marius' spirit to rekindle Marius’s sense of purpose. Marius departs, encouraging [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) to "keep fighting."

- **Valanthe:** [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) uses humor and his _Vicious Mockery_ spell to help Valanthe recall her satirical plays mocking Apollyon. Her laughter returns, and she departs, thanking the party to "remember my works."

- **Khemut of Targu:** [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) invokes maritime sights and sounds, reconnecting Khemut to her life as a sailor. His vivid descriptions prompt her to recall her ship, the Sword of the Wind. She departs, whispering, "The wind, the best part of the ocean."

- **Antonius Patrius:** [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)’s descriptions of sacred pilgrimages push Antonius to recall his organizational skills and purpose. Faltering, but guided by one of the [Gidari](<../../../species/children-of-creation/gidari.md>), he departs hesitantly, as a final snap echoes through the expanse.

With the liberation of all seven souls, the phylactery dagger disintegrates into metallic threads that unravel and vanish. A wailing screech erupts, symbolizing the breaking of its hold, before fading into silence.

---

Not wishing to linger, the party uses the Rainbow Bridge to return to [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), arriving invisibly to observe the crew. [Baxter](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/companions/baxter.md>) provides a telepathic update: the ship is heading east toward the sun under orders from [Faldrak Bronzehammer](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>).

Uncertain as to why the ship has turned and traveled so far from [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), but not sensing anyone other than their crew aboard, the party emerges cautiously. The party learns that Fausto, their long-time nemesis, visited the ship with a group of mages. Using powerful charms, he manipulated the crew into pursuing the mythical city of Pu'aatar, a legendary hidden city in the desert, famed for its rumored library of mythic scale. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), realizing the crew is charmed somehow, uses his cleansing touch to dispel the charms. The party regroups with a late breakfast, before teleporting to the Temple of the Eight Divines. Our session ends as the party arrives to find [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) waiting for them at the temple, in a rage. 


## Detailed Summary

### Returning to the Temple of the Eight Divines
- The party returns to the Temple of the Eight Divines after traversing parts of Drankor, collecting mementos for two of the seven souls bound to Apollyon’s phylactery.
- Wellby remained at the temple, guarding the dagger containing Apollyon’s soul.
- The group recounts their journey, including:
	- Visiting the Laughing Wave, a halfling tavern once owned by Serafina Apple Blossom.
	- Fighting undead that cursed them with sorrowful visions of the tavern being raided by gray-cloaked mages.
	- Discovering a punch bowl and fireworks casings connected to Seraphina’s joyful memories of halflings celebrating on the tavern’s roof.
	- Finding a foreign coin tied to Khemut of Targu in the tavern’s cellar.
	- Exploring the Customs House, where they encountered a swirling red mist and recovered important scrolls and a shipping manifest tied to Khemut of Targu’s ship.
	- Identifying a connection to Minarith, linked to the University of the Blessed Waters.
- Wellby shares news from Sura, indicating that Chardonian forces have begun attacking Dunmar. Sura’s army faces shadowy assassins and advancing legions, creating a dire situation.
- While concerned about Fausto, a recurring adversary, potentially targeting [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), and the situation in Dunmar, the group decides to focus on finding the last memento and accessing the Land of the Dead, reasoning that destroying Apollyon is the most effective way to help Dunmar.
- [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) uses his magical bow to locate the University of the Blessed Waters, firing an arrow that vanishes and reveals a path visible only to him.
- The university is approximately a mile away to the southeast. The party prepares to follow Welby’s lead, moving swiftly through the ruins of Drankor.


### Entering the Garden of Statues
- The group follows [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) through the jungle and ruins, avoiding unnatural creaks and whispers emanating from the buildings they bypass.
- Heavy rain begins to fall, but the jungle canopy offers some protection as they navigate the humid terrain.
- The path leads to an overgrown garden with two intact statues flanking the entrance to the University of the Blessed Waters.
- As the group enters the garden, Kenzo notices the statues subtly shift and move, becoming animated guardians of the area.
- Kenzo rushes forward to engage one statue but discovers their ability to teleport as it evades his attacks.
- Seeker uses *Summon Construct* to create a stone ally, which provides additional melee support.
- Delwath casts *Synaptic Static*, reducing the statues’ effectiveness with diminished attack rolls and saving throws.
- Riswynn casts *Sunburst*, blinding both statues and dealing massive radiant damage, turning the tide of the battle.
- The statues retaliate with powerful psychic attacks, targeting the party’s emotional vulnerabilities and causing waves of sadness.
- Despite their initial struggles, the party capitalizes on the statues’ blindness:
	- Kenzo delivers a flurry of strikes, severely damaging the first statue.
	- Wellby lands the finishing blow on the second statue with his radiant-enhanced attacks.
	- Riswynn shakes off the sadness effect and provides additional support with her spells.
- Both statues are destroyed, crumbling into heaps of rubble.
- The garden is cleared, and the party regroups to assess their condition before proceeding into the university.


### The Ruins of the Faculty of Natural History
- The party enters the dilapidated building labeled "Faculty of Natural History" in Drankorian, which Minarith the peronar was associated with.
- The structure shows signs of severe decay, with unstable floors and a tree growing through its center. Despite its instability, Kenzo senses a faint psychic connection to Minarith in the northwest corner of the ruins.
- As the group traverses the ruins, Wellby triggers a roof collapse but avoids significant injury.
- The party carefully climbs over the rubble, reaching what appears to have been a row of offices. Kenzo identifies one as Minarith’s, overgrown with vines and debris.
- Inside the office, they discover a palm-sized wooden and metal bird, partially buried in dirt. The bird is intricately carved, with inlaid silver eyes and a marble body. It exudes faint transmutation magic.
- The bird contains a hidden compartment, which the party opens to find a tightly rolled piece of paper.
- The note, written in Elvish and addressed to Maglar, reads: *"I hope this message finds you. I am trusting to luck and this magic trinket to bring this note to you. I finally... They're coming. I can hide no longer. I know not what will happen to me, but few, if any, of our people have survived the Ashen Cloaks. I thought maybe my unimportance might protect me, for who really cares about the study of plants when down the hall there is the study of great magics and fire, and the planes and the gods that can reshape reality themselves. But it was always the case, I guess, that he would never let any of our people survive, and I have nowhere left to flee. Run if you can."
- Both the bird and the note are suffused with Minarith’s soul energy, marking them as significant mementos for the ritual to free Apollyon’s bound souls.
- With all seven mementos secured, the group teleports to [Tollen](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) to locate a recently deceased soul for the Plane Shift spell required to reach the Land of the Dead.  


### Bargaining at the Philosopher’s Guild
- The party teleports to the Philosopher’s Guild in Tollen, escaping the oppressive heat and rain of Drankor into the guild’s tranquil garden.
- They are greeted by an idyllic spring day, with a warm breeze and distant city sounds muffled by the guild’s magical wards, creating a zone of calm.
- Upon entering the guild, the party is met by a middle-aged woman in white robes who greets them with interest, recognizing their presence from past dealings.
- The guild representative inquires about the party’s purpose, prompting Delwath to explain their urgent need for guidance on:
	- Dangers mortals face in the Land of the Dead.
	- Methods to coax imprisoned souls to their rightful place.
	- The party emphasizes the time-sensitive nature of their request, offering to trade valuable magical items for answers by dawn.
- The group presents several items as potential trades:
	- The Watcher’s Dagger, a relic of eastern origin from [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>)
	- Kadmos’s Rod of the Pact Keeper, a dark and unsettling artifact.
- The guild representative outlines specific protocols for the exchange:
	- The party must relinquish all personal items and don guild-provided robes to ensure confidentiality.
	- The questions will be asked in a private chamber, with answers provided through a veiled intermediary.
	- The session will focus strictly on the outlined topics, with no deviations permitted.
- Delwath’s charisma and the group’s urgent demeanor convince the guild to expedite the process. They agree to provide the requested information within 12 hours, though the representative expresses unease at the deviation from standard timelines.
- While the others rest, Delwath seeks out [Melindir](<../../../people/elves/melindir.md>), an elven ambassador with whom the party shares a prior rapport.
- [Melindir](<../../../people/elves/melindir.md>) confirms that [Orenlas](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/orenlas.md>) has limited resources to send aid, as much of their martial energy is devoted to defending their borders from the Plaguelands.
- He suggests contacting the Stoneborn in the nearby mountains. Delwath mentions [Drikod](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/drikod.md>), a former ally familiar with Dunmar’s plight.
- [Melindir](<../../../people/elves/melindir.md>) provides Delwath with a vial of charm resistance, noting it may prove useful in their upcoming journey.
- Delwath warns [Melindir](<../../../people/elves/melindir.md>) of the dire consequences should their mission fail, ensuring the elves are prepared for Apollyon’s potential return.
- While Delwath speaks with [Melindir](<../../../people/elves/melindir.md>), Kenzo and Wellby lead the effort to locate a suitable body at a local temple, where priests are persuaded to permit the use of a recently deceased individual after assurances of respect for the soul.  


### Secrets of the Land of the Dead
- That evening, news comes the [Philosopher's Guild](<../../../groups/tollen-guilds/ancient-and-honorable-guild-of-philosophers.md>) is ready for them; the party is led into a quiet room and instructed to leave all possessions behind, donning white robes provided by the guild.
- They are escorted into a darkened room where no light penetrates, not even magical darkvision.
- Blindfolded for further secrecy, they are seated on a cold stone bench to await the arrival of the voice.
- A disembodied voice addresses the party, answering their questions about the realm:
	- **Physical Toll:** The Land of the Dead saps the vitality of living beings. Food and water disintegrate, and no wounds can heal while within the plane.
	- **Mortality:** Time spent in the Land of the Dead gradually erodes the connection between soul and body. Prolonged stays are perilous, even for the strong.
	- **Souls’ Journey:** The plane moves travelers towards their destination, like a river. Souls should not be interfered with, or curses may follow.
	- **Magic and Binding:** Powerful magic can confuse souls, causing them to become lost, but no magic can truly trap a soul permanently.
	- **Interaction with the Giardi:** The Giardi, guardians of the Land of the Dead, will protect those with pure intentions. They can see into the soul and discern truth, so deception is impossible.The party is warned to avoid interference with souls unless restoring them to their rightful fate.
	- The voice explains that the phylactery may confuse the seven bound souls, making it difficult for them to remember their past lives.
	- To free the souls, the party must provide clues and context, helping them recall their identities and original fates.
- The voice offers parting advice:
	- Time in the Land of the Dead mirrors time in the material world, making swift action essential.
	- Those who have the magic to enter the plane must ensure they have the means to leave before the realm’s effects take hold.
- A bright light flashes, and the woman who escorted them returns to remove their blindfolds.
- The party rests for the night before their journey to the Land of the Dead.


### The Destruction of Apollyon's Phylactery
- The next morning, Riswynn casts Plane Shift, and the party arrives in a gray, barren expanse where the horizon and sky blend indistinctly.
- An elderly man, the soul of the recently deceased body used for the *Plane Shift* spell, appears beside them, focused on a distant point and walking determinedly.
- The air is dry, lifeless, and devoid of weather, contributing to an unsettling stillness.
- The party retrieves the phylactery dagger and spreads it on a cloth alongside the seven mementos.
- Seven indistinct, shadowy figures emerge, pacing a circular path around the dagger. Their forms lack definition, and their speech is fragmented in various languages, including Drankorian, Elvish, and Common.
- Seraphina Appleblossom
	- Wellby recounts vivid tales of the Laughing Wave tavern and the joy of fireworks on its roof.
	- Using Insight (natural 20), Wellby bridges her connection to her past, helping her recall her name.

- Marius of Drankor
	- Kenzo speaks of shared struggles against oppression, aligning Marius’s rebellion with his own fight for justice.
	- Using Insight (18 after reroll), Kenzo helps Marius regain his sense of purpose.
	- Marius acknowledges his past with a nod and departs, encouraging Kenzo to "keep fighting."
- Valanthe
	- Seeker recalls Valanthe’s satirical plays that mocked Apollyon, using humor to restore her sense of identity.
	- Employing *Vicious Mockery* (19), Seeker’s clever taunts bring laughter to Valente, rekindling her spirit.
	- Valente departs, thanking Seeker and urging the party to "remember my works."
- Khemut of Targu
	- Wellby invokes the sights, sounds, and freedom of maritime trade to reconnect Kemet to her life as a sailor and merchant.
	- Using Nature, Wellby’s evocative descriptions prompt Kemet to recall her ship, the Sword of the Wind.
	- She departs with the whisper, "The wind, the best part of the ocean," as a phantom breeze stirs.
- Antonius Patrius
	- Delwath describes the rituals and responsibilities of pilgrimage paths, aligning Antonius’s organizational skills with sacred stewardship.
	- Using Perception (successfully inspired to meet DC 15), Delwath's vivid imagery helps Antonius find his direction, albeit haltingly and somewhat confused.
	- Antonius departs hesitantly, guided by one of the Giardi, as a final snap echoes through the expanse.
- With the liberation of all seven souls, the dagger disintegrates into threads of metal, which unravel and vanish.
- A wailing, screeching sound erupts from the phylactery, symbolizing the breaking of its hold, before it fades into silence.


### Confrontation Aboard Vindristjarna
- Not wishing to linger in the Land of the Dead, the party uses the Rainbow Bridge to return to [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), initially arriving invisibly to observe the crew.
- Kenzo uses Soul Sight to scan for any unusual presences or emotional disturbances, confirming that the crew appears normal but excited and curious.
- Baxter, their loyal animal companion, provides a telepathic update that the ship is heading east toward the sun under orders from [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) and others.
- The party learns that Fausto, their long-time nemesis, visited the ship with a group of mages and charmed the crew into seeking the hidden city of Pu'aatar, a legendary desert library.
- Using a combination of Insight and magical checks, the party determines that the charm effects are tied to Fausto’s lingering influence.
- Kenzo breaks the enchantment with his cleanse soul ability. 
- Faldrak regains clarity, questioning why he believed in the city’s existence and admitting that Fausto manipulated them into leaving Drankor.
- The crew reports that Fausto stayed aboard for a day with seven companions, including a heavily armored figure and several mages.
- A thorough search reveals no major thefts, though minor items might be missing. Crucially, the entombed Cloud Spinner, remains untouched.
- The party decides to teleport back to the Temple of the Eight Divines, reasoning that their quest to defeat Apollyon must take precedence.
- Upon arriving at the temple, the party is confronted by Fausto himself, who exclaims, "You fools! What have you done?"

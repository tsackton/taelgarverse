## Narrative
  
We begin on the afternoon of May 3rd, 1749, as the confrontation with Rhodar von Glauer culminated dramatically. Amidst a magically darkened chamber, the party meticulously planned their attack strategies, balancing the risks of friendly fire against the imperative of exploiting their individual combat strengths. Wellby initiated the offense by marking von Glauer's position with an arrow, while Riswynn brilliantly illuminated the vampire with a Sunbeam spell.

The fight escalated quickly as von Glauer unleashed a barrage of dark spears and sword attacks, wounding Kenzo and Riswynn. Despite this, the group's coordination was impeccable. Seeker attempted a Slow spell, albeit unsuccessfully, while Dewalth landed heavy blows enhanced by Yezali's Mark. Riswynn continued to assault with Sunbeam and a summoned Spiritual Weapon, significantly weakening von Glauer. The vampire, desperate, transformed into a flaming bat, swooping through the party and dealing damage, but ultimately it wasn't enough to stave off defeat. After a series of calculated attacks and a final melee confrontation led by Kenzo, von Glauer was dispatched, dissipating into a noxious cloud that momentarily disoriented the party.

In the aftermath, Dewalth pursued the remnants of von Glauer to his coffin, ensuring the vampire's permanent destruction by targeting the mist with radiant energy. The victorious party then scoured the coffin, uncovering a collection of intriguing items including a magical dagger with blindsight abilities. However, their victory was overshadowed by the imminent structural collapse of Shadowkeep, prompted by their intense battle.

The escape from the crumbling Shadowkeep was fraught with peril and urgency. Amid the chaos, Wellby and Kenzo prioritized salvaging valuable treasures, while the rest of the group managed external threats. Despite the hazardous conditions, they successfully extracted significant loot, including gold and magical items, narrowly evading hostile wraiths they encountered along the way, and leaving the venom troll to claim the ruins of Shadowkeep as his new domain.

The night brought a need for reflection and planning. Using the Dream spell, Dewalth engaged in a crucial conversation with Lyra, addressing misunderstandings and discussing recent calamitous events in Chardon, where doppelg√§ngers of Kenzo and Delwath had been implicated in a terrorist attack. This revelation suggested manipulation by their adversaries, adding layers of political intrigue to their quest.

By the morning of May 4th, the party returned to Voknaz Manor, presenting tokens of von Glauer's defeat to a nervous Olen Vrask. Their proof was accepted, and they were awarded the Jade Piece of Rai's Hand, a critical element in their ongoing mission to prevent the release of Apollyon, a looming threat detailed in a vivid dream vision triggered by the jade piece.

As the day progressed, the party used the Dream spell to maintain communication with allies such as Faldrak, Amil, and Kethra, learning of developments that further complicated their strategic considerations. Their discussions underscored the urgency of their primary quest over potential distractions, highlighting a burgeoning crisis that could culminate in a catastrophic release of Apollyon.

The session ended with Seeker's successful teleportation to [[Nevium]] on the morning of May 5th, marking the beginning of the next phase of their journey, situating them strategically near the Gulf of Chardon as they prepared to search for the next [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]].

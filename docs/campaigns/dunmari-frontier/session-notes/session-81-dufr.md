# Session 81
*in which the party visits [Orenlas](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/orenlas.md>)*

**In the real world:** Nov 8, 2023
**In Taelgar:**  Jan 8, 1749 - Jan 16, 1749

## Summary

- The party visited the forest of [Orenlas](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/orenlas.md>), where they explored the living city of [Erelion](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/erelion.md>), visiting the sacred elder tree and meeting Caretaker [Erdhin](<../../../people/elves/erdhin.md>), the gardener [Ealwen](<../../../people/elves/ealwen.md>), the retired solider [Vahaiya](<../../../people/elves/vahaiya.md>), and the poet [Cirdore](<../../../people/elves/cirdore.md>). 
- After [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) attempts to get [Ealwen](<../../../people/elves/ealwen.md>) to join the crew of [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), she says that while she does not feel she can leave [Erelion](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/erelion.md>), she does know a few people who might want to join the ship as a gardener. 
- The party spoke with the ancient [elf](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>), who told them about the days of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>): the [civil war](<../../../events/drankorian-civil-war.md>) that ended centuries of peace; the rise of [Omnis Pura](<../../../groups/drankorian-societies/omnis-pura.md>); [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>)'s reign; and his attempted ascension to godhood and ultimate downfall. 
- After spending a day speaking with an learning from [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>), the party got a desperate message from [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), informing them that [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) was nearly finished constructing a massive trebuchet, 400 feet tall at least, and if they did not arrive soon, [Uzgukhar](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>) would be destroyed. 

#### The Story of Apollyon and Cha'mutte

Piecing together what [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>) told you, you reconstruct the following timeline of [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) and [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>). 

This story is told from [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>)'s point of view [here](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md#arhestes-story>).

- After the Drankorian civil war, [Omnis Pura](<../../../groups/drankorian-societies/omnis-pura.md>) and [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) became allies, and when [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) came to power, he continued to ally with [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>). 
- However, [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) became angry when [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) stole the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) from the free [orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), as [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s goal was to free all species from the "shackles" of their divine creators, whether they wished it or not. The cloak was a step in that direction. You saw part of this in the [Mantle of Protection Vision](<../mirror-visions/mantle-of-protection-vision.md>). 
- As [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) grew in power, he began systematically slaughtering the peronar, the [elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) who had allied with [humans](<../../../species/humans/humans.md>) long ago on Hkar. He used powerful magic to turn the people of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) into slavishly devoted subjects, hoping to further his dream of an empire of only the "purest" of humanity. 
- Using the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>), [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) was able to defeat the [elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) of [RostaurÃ«](<../../../history/drankorian-era/rostaure.md>) ([Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>)'s home), as the cloak prevented the divine power of [Aldanor](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/aldanor.md>) and[Elmerca](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/elmerca.md>) from protecting the land. He brought [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>), captured back to [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), where she saw his rise to power firsthand. You saw some of this in the [Scepter of Command Vision](<../mirror-visions/scepter-of-command-vision.md>). 
- [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) fully turned on [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) when [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) attempted to ascend to godhood, in defiance of [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s plans and hopes for the world. At the moment [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) attempted to claim divine power, he was struck down by the [First Plague](<../../../events/1000s/1059/first-plague.md>), a devastating magical force of [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s creation. 
- [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>) survived the plague, but at great cost. It left her sick and weakened, and stripped her of her formidable magic.
- [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) also survived the plague, by drinking of vial of a pure black substance. [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>) later learned that this was the key ingredient in a ritual of undeath, and had turned [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) into a lich.
- However, [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) was trapped by [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>), who for unexplained reasons did not seek to destroy [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) utterly. Whether it was because he couldn't, or because he didn't want to, [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>) never learned. 
- When [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) was killed, [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) began to break free, until [Rai](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>) teleported to [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), warned by [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>), and sought to maintain the bonds. [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>) never learned how [Rai](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>) did this, but speculated it was as simple as grasping [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>)'s phylactery in his magical [jade](<../treasure/gifts-and-heirlooms/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>) hand. 
- At the beginning of this leya, around 1720 as [humans](<../../../species/humans/humans.md>) reckon time, [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>) felt something change. A break, a shift, in [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>)'s bonds, letting him break free and slowly gain power, recovering from the weakness of his long imprisonment. 
- [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>), though too weak from the ongoing effects of plague exposure to seek [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) herself, will do anything in her power to ensure that he is defeated, once and for all, his phylactery destroyed utterly, and any hope of his resurrection crushed. 

The story of the scepter of command, as told in later days by the halflings, is [here](<../../../primary-sources/story-of-the-scepter-of-command.md>).

## Narrative

We begin on [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), as the party has returned to the skyship after several days at the Elemental Forge while [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) constructed a number of magic items from the residual energy of the forge left behind by [Shâshethis](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/shshethis.md>)'s departure. The day before, as [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) finished his work, the party had viewed the [forge itself in Eudomes' mirror](<../mirror-visions/elemental-forge-vision.md>). Now, we pick up as the party heads south for [Orenlas](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/orenlas.md>), and [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) writes in his journal:

*4 Barukhelm 5881, he writes*

*My first adventure in more than a decade succeeded beyond my wildest imagination. That Seeker fellow sure knows how to pick his friends. I was not sure what to think when I first met them: they seemed rather prone to excessive chatter, and terminal indecision. I was afraid it would be like being back on my travels with Lyrial and her friends. So much time sitting around debating, so little time doing! Although I guess it was in one of those rambling discursions that she told me about the Edge of Echoes in the first place.*

*But once we got moving, I couldn't help but wonder at the powerful oddities they carried and their skill at using them. A folding boat I've seen, sure; but a mirror that reveals the history of things? That was a sight. And all Seeker's friends proved quite adept in battle: I think I would have been drowned by water elementals if they had not leapt to my defense.*

*And flight! Ah, to fly again! It was nothing like the flying carpet we borrowed back in the day. To be able to think and just go where you wished it - truly something else. Somehow the fey step trick I learned from Lyrial feels cheap in comparison now.*

*Of course, my goal was to make my dear Pebblepeep fly, and I can't believe how successful I was! I surprise even myself sometimes, ha ha. All the hard work outfitting this ship (oh, this ship! I wonder if they'll let me stay, or maybe even fly it some day?) was well worth it.*

*It will be hard going back to life in Tollen after this.*

[Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>)'s writing is interrupted by the arrival of another message from the [Philosopher's Guild](<../../../groups/tollen-guilds/ancient-and-honorable-guild-of-philosophers.md>), this time concerning [the binding stones](<../letters-notes-and-tales/philosopher-s-information-concerning-binding-stones.md>). The party reads and discusses. 

The next day, the ship arrives at the edge of [Orenlas](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/orenlas.md>). The forest is shrouded in mists, and the party is forced to land outside, on the shores of the large lake, using the [planar prism](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md#planar-prism>) for the first time to construct a rainbow bridge from the ship to the ground. While Faldrak stays behind, the party ventures into the forest.

The paths open up as they walk, revealing visions and fragments of dreams of possible futures: Kenzo, mediating in an alien place of impossible depth; Delwath, traveling across the planes, protecting those in need across the multiverse; Seeker, writing a book in his home full of the laughter of his children and visions of his friends across the multiverse; Wellby, at sea, leagues and leagues west of any known land, perhaps, just perhaps glimpsing sight of a mountain rising from the horizon in the distance. You feel, as you walk, that this is Aldanor testing your desires, your hopes, and accepting you.

The party arrives at the gates of [Erelion](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/erelion.md>), where they are greeted by Caretaker [Erdhin](<../../../people/elves/erdhin.md>). He settles the party in a guest house of a sort; plans are made for a dinner party; and then the group leaves to experience the wonders of the city. 

The party strolls through the fey gardens where silver grows in delicate flowers, where vines are laden with fruit at all seasons, where oysters grown from the roots of lily pads. They find their way to the massive elder tree, the tree of dreaming, the sacred space where the echoes of the footsteps of [Aldanor](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/aldanor.md>) on the land, that created the first forests, can still be heard. Kenzo communes with the forest, and is gently guided to safer paths, told he is not ready for this, the original forest, the place that still retains some of the magic of the days of myth when the world was young. 

After an afternoon exploring, the party returns and hosts guests for dinner, cooked by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>). In addition to Caretak [Erdhin](<../../../people/elves/erdhin.md>), the guests are a young gardener named [Ealwen](<../../../people/elves/ealwen.md>), a retired solider named[Vahaiya](<../../../people/elves/vahaiya.md>), and a poet named [Cirdore](<../../../people/elves/cirdore.md>). As conversation flows, the party learns there is an elder here who could speak of Apollyon and Drankor; her name is [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>), and unlike nearly any other elf her age, she is very sick. [Ealwen](<../../../people/elves/ealwen.md>), her caretaker, is reluctant to disturb her, but relents after speaking at length about herbs and ki and healing powers with [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>). While [Ealwen](<../../../people/elves/ealwen.md>) does not feel she can leave [Erelion](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/erelion.md>), she does say she has a few people in mind who might want to join the ship as a gardener. 

The next morning, the party travels with [Ealwen](<../../../people/elves/ealwen.md>) to visit [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>), outside the city. [Arheste](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md>) is clearly ill, unable to sit without wheezing, and struggles to tell her story until [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) uses some of his precious ki from the jungles of [Orekatu](<../../../gazetteer/far-south/orekatu.md>) to ease her damaged soul. While not strong enough to completely undo the evils done to her, it helps, tremendously. 

For the rest of the day, Arheste tells her story, about Drankor and Apollyon and Cha'mutte, which is recorded [here](<../../../people/elves/arheste.md#arhestes-story>).

As evening comes, the party receives a desperate plea for help from Riswynn: [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) is nearly done constructing a massive trebuchet, and if they do not arrive to help soon, the city will be destroyed.

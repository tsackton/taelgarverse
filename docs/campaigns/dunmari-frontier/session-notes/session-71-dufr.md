### Timeline
- Nov 23, 1748 DR, evening: Fight Hraglar's storm-crazed ghost duplicate. Free Hraglar from his chains, watch as he destroys the tower and the statue of his bust. Sit with [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) for the evening, talking. 

## Narrative
We begin as the party rushes into [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>)'s dreamscape upon hearing the sounds of [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) struggling, to find a ghostly, angry version of [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) strangling the real [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>). Launching into combat, the party attacks the ghost, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) placing two perfect arrows right through each of the ghost's eyes and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) striking hard with his elven sword. Despite a massive bolt of lightning that briefly knocks [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) down, the party prevails, and as [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>)'s ghost is destroyed the dreamscape fades. The party finds themselves in the top floor of [Stormcaller Tower](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>), facing the bound and chained giant Hraglar.

His mind now clear, he recognizes the party and tells them he can hold off the madness for a few hours, if they wish to flee again. Showing him the eyes, the party tells him they are here to save him, as promised. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) uses her mending magic to repair the eyes, and as the damage and cracks from the years and the journey are repaired, each eye magically melds with [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>), restoring his vision. 

The iron chains, however, seem a tougher nut to crack, until [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) recalls his memory of the binding from when he was possessed, recalling that the the first words of the elven poem A Lament for Lost Thunder can break the chains and end the enchantment. Unfortunately, the party sold the book containing this poem in [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>), and can't quite recall the words correctly. However, a quick Sending to [Govir](<../../../people/dunmari/govir.md>) has him promising to find a copy in the next couple of hours, when [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) will scry him to see the writing and translate the words. 

At this point, the party takes a breather, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) cooking some food while [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) talks about [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>). He tells them about the end of the golden age of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), when the [Helea](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/helea.md>) was assassinated by the [Omnis Pura](<../../../groups/drankorian-societies/omnis-pura.md>), a group that believed in [human](<../../../species/humans/humans.md>) supremacy, and especially supremacy of those who inhabited Hkar, the land where [Humans](<../../../species/humans/humans.md>) were created, the longest. [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) says, was connected to this group, but he was captured during [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>)'s reign and doesn't know how it ended, not really. 

[Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) then listens to [Jorundr's Story](<../collected-stories/jorundr-s-story.md>), recording it for the [Order of the Awakened Soul](<../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/order-of-the-awakened-soul.md>).

Over the next hour, the party gathers what they can from the tower, focusing on the few books left in the library from their last adventure, and the cleaning stone from [Eudomes](<../../../people/historical-figures/eudomes.md>)' room. Then, it is time to scry [Govir](<../../../people/dunmari/govir.md>), and read the words of A Lament for Lost Thunder through his eyes. As [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) speaks the words, the chains binding [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) shatter and turn to dust. 

The storm grows more intense and violent, and [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) warns the party to run, as he turns to lightning and thunder and sweeps out of the tower. An incredibly loud burst of thunder shakes the foundations of the tower, and then [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) is there, pulling a giant sword of lightning out of thin air, his eyes flashing as he strikes the tower, the statue, everything about this place over and over. Even once the tower is reduced to rubble and the bust of himself that imprisoned him to dust, he lifts his massive feet and stomps, sending waves of thunder through the destruction. And then, [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) thanks the party, asking what he can do for them. 

![Stormcaller After Storm](../../../assets/stormcaller-after-storm.png)

The party asks about [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), also known as the The Star on the Wind, the skyship upon which [Stormcaller Tower](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>) was built. [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) tells them the phasing stone, the magic that powers skyships, was destroyed, but he sends the storm north. The clouds blow away, the thunder and rain stops, and a beautiful sunset emerges on the wet plains. [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) opens his eyes, and tells the party that there is still a phasing stone in his home in the mountains, less than a hundred miles north, that they are welcome to find and claim for themselves.

He then digs out the skyship and gives the party a tour. While much is damaged, when cleared and excavated, it looks like nothing more than a truly massive sailing ship made of stone.

With this task done, [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) goes to hunt and say goodbye to his physical form, joined for part of his journey by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>). As the sun sinks below the horizon, he returns with a brace of antelope. As [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) and the party begin to speak of [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), of his sometimes-ally, perhaps turned enemy [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>), of the perfectly circular island where [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) traveled, somewhere southwest of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>) and shielded from storms, the smell of roasting anelope wafts over the camp. We end the session as [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) and the party share a late dinner, planning to resume their conversation this evening, before [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) vanishes to merge with the storm and learn the tales of the snow and storms and wind and rain.

## Narrative

We begin as the day of deception passes, Dec 6th, during which the party tries to fool anyone scrying, convincing watchers that they have attempted to steal the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) from Chief [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>). The day passes in fits and starts, until the party departs in false disgrace in the late afternoon. Camping in the desert, the party scries [Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>), seeing him on a boat on the river, an uncertain distance away. After preparing for a battle with Hero's Feast, and sneaking back into the palace, the party passes a fitful night waiting for an attack that does not come.

The next morning, Dec 7th, the party stays hidden in the palace, waiting. [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>) brings bad news: the western border was attacked, with huge loss of life, and the fortress at Khumarz cannot hold back another assault of undead. The day passes. Two [orc](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) warriors from the western front arrive, to provide more support for the coming battle with [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>). Day turns to night, as the party waits, tense.

Past midnight -- early in the morning on Dec 8th -- the attack begins with an undead assault on the city gates. While the palace guards rush off to protect the townsfolk, the party prepares for [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>)' assault on [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>) and attempt to steal the cloak. Hiding in the bedrooms, the party waits until [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s alarm is triggered, and launches their attack. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s sickening radiance keeps the vanguard of [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>)' crew at bay for a moment, although [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) takes the brunt of ranged attacks, as he is initially the only easy target. As the fight proceeds, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) pins down the large demonic creature commanded by [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) with his frightening strike, but [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) and [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) manage to dimension door into the room with [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>), and make a grab for the cloak, stopped only by [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) dimension dooring away with [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>). [Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>) manages to barrel through the door and grab [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>) and the cloak, only to be stopped by [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s irresistible curiosity spell, trapping him in [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s sickening radiance with [Lubash](<../../../people/orcs/lubash.md>), who nearly dies from the spell. Still, even with the large warriors ([Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>) and the demon) neutralized, [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>), [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>), and [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) made to get away with the cloak, until [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>) was stopped by [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s wall of fire. Still, [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) and [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) nearly get away, stopped only by a clutch counterspell from [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), stopping [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>)'s final dimension door. 

With everyone barely alive, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) uses sleep to bring the enemies unconscious. The session ends as [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) is executed and the remaining prisoners are stripped of their gear and trapped in the mirror.

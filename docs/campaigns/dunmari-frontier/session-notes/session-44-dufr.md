**(Thursday, April 14th, 2022; in Taelgar, July 23rd)

We begin as the party faces off against [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) and his companions, with [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) charmed by [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>)’ magic. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), enraged by [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>)’ actions, rushes forward, avoiding [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s attempt to defuse the situation by turning him into a bunny rabbit, but running straight into [Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>)’s halberd before he can launch a flurry of blows at [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>). Despite the slashing attack from [Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>), [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)’s staff and fists land true and he nearly knocks [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) unconscious. Unfortunately, though, [Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>) returns the favor, and [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) is taken down by two quick blows with the halberd.

At this point, both [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>) and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) reach over to heal [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), and the violence calms for a moment as the encounter turns to conversation. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) offers to show [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) the [ring](<../treasure/treasure-from-agata/ring-of-displacement.md>) from [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>) he has, and is concerned about [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), as [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) is still under the influence of a charm. While the conversation continues, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) quietly reaches out to [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>)’s essence and, after a few attempts, breaks the charm that has a hold on him. 

Over time as [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) press the conversation, it slowly becomes clear to everyone that something is up. [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) speculates that the [Scepter of Command](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/scepter-of-command.md>) may be exerting its influence, although no one lets on that the party is carrying the scepter. [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>) and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) attempt to make a deal for a map to [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s lair and the [Ever Spinning Top](<../treasure/treasure-from-agata/ever-spinning-top.md>), but it doesn’t quite connect. Eventually, the charm wears off, and the Chardonians retreat to a protected magical sphere created by [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) to rest, while the party leaves towards the wyvern’s lair.

On the road to the abandoned mining town of [Vandar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/vandar.md>), the party finds the ruins of the caravan that left down this road some days ago, carrying silk and paper – much of the silk is salvageable but the paper has been badly damaged by the rain. Upon arriving at the town of [Vandar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/vandar.md>), they find it largely ruined, with an obvious wyvern’s lair in the middle of the town square, and an oozing poisonous swamp with a sleeping ogre of some kind at the base of the hill. The temple is still partially intact, and that is where they set a camp.

That evening, after midnight, a group of the Chardonians attempts to stealthily steal some magic items from the party. However, they are detected, and a battle ensues. [Marcella](<../../../people/chardonians/marcella.md>), the main thief, is quickly knocked unconscious and left for dead (“left for chance to decide her fate,” says [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>)). [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) and [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) launch an attack, and the battle turns into a vicious exchange of magic. [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) kills all seven bandits with a fireball, and eventually [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) is worn down by a ghost summoned by [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>). 

As everyone approaches the end of their resources and health, and the battle threatens to leave one or more people on both sides dead, [Marcella](<../../../people/chardonians/marcella.md>) approaches from down the path, battered but miraculously and luckily recovered. She implores everyone to stop fighting, and [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>), badly wounded and nearing death, does not argue. While the conversation is bitter, the parties eventually agree that [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) will take the [Ever Spinning Top](<../treasure/treasure-from-agata/ever-spinning-top.md>), and [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) will pay a wereguild of 25 gold per bandit killed, a total of 175 gp, but [Marcella](<../../../people/chardonians/marcella.md>)’s weapons and ring of haste will be returned to her. 

While these negotiations are happening, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) and [Marcella](<../../../people/chardonians/marcella.md>) grab a private moment out of sight behind the Wall of Fire summoned by [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>). After a whispered conversation, [Marcella](<../../../people/chardonians/marcella.md>) turns disdainfully away and looks back at [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) with anger. But [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) has a thoughtful look on his face.

## Session Info

### Summary
- [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) successfully performs a ritual to free [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) from a cursed chain with the help of [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s prayers and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s magic, sacrificing the [Horn of Silent Alarm](<../treasure/treasure-from-dunmari-ruins/horn-of-silent-alarm.md>).
- The [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) travels across the rain-soaked plains of [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), with [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) praying daily to the [Bahrazel](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>) to free [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) from the [Medusa Blade](<../treasure/treasure-from-agata/medusa-blade.md>)'s curse.
- Using scrying and sending spells, the party learns of [Johar](<../../../people/dunmari/johar.md>)'s situation and [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>)' movements through the [Garamjala Desert](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>).
- A deserted [Raven's Hold](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/raven-s-hold.md>) and a nearby mass grave suggest the death of [Inakara](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/inakara.md>) and her kin at the hands of dwarves.
- [Bahrazel](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>) answers [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s prayers, freeing [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) from the [Medusa Blade](<../treasure/treasure-from-agata/medusa-blade.md>)'s curse, which prompts an apology from the party for gifting the cursed sword.
- The party arrives at [Stormcaller Tower](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>) to find Hralgar's storm intensified, considering entry into the [Dreamworld](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/proximate-realms/dreamworld.md>) to calm [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>).

## Narrative
We begin as the party settles in for the night outside Lastlight Falls, after a long evening of talking and reconnecting. In the morning, [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) prepares the magic she needs to attempt to free [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) from the cursed chain bound to his soul from his encounter with [Motua](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/motua.md>). The ritual succeeds, with the aid of the prayers of [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) to the tanshi and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s runic inspiration magic, and [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) is freed, at the cost of the [Horn of Silent Alarm](<../treasure/treasure-from-dunmari-ruins/horn-of-silent-alarm.md>) carried for many months. 

Over the course of the next week, the party falls into a routine as they hurry across the plains of [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), now sprung to life with the monsoon rains.

![Dunmar November 1748](../../../assets/dunmar-november-1748.png)

[Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) prays each morning to the Baharazel, asking them to free [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) of the curse that binds him to the [Medusa Blade](<../treasure/treasure-from-agata/medusa-blade.md>), taken from [Agata's lair](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/agata-s-lair.md>) and gifted to [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) by the party. As the party travels, they send messages to [Johar](<../../../people/dunmari/johar.md>) via sending, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) keeps an eye on the movements of [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) and company via scrying. 

From brief conversations, they learn that [Johar](<../../../people/dunmari/johar.md>) is alive, and well enough treated, although he has not been allowed to see Samraat [Nayan Karnas](<../../../people/dunmari/nayan-karnas.md>), apparently because of the Samraat's (perhaps justifiably?) paranoid belief that [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) is somehow behind [Sura](<../../../people/dunmari/sura.md>)'s reemergence. Not trusting [Johar](<../../../people/dunmari/johar.md>) to be who he says he is, Karnas has summoned a wizard from [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) and a mystai of [Sonkar](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/sonkar.md>) who are both gifted with the power of true sight, who will vouch for [Johar](<../../../people/dunmari/johar.md>) before he can speak with Karnas. From brief visions via scrying, they learn that [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) continues east, towards [Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>), through the [Garamjala Desert](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>).

Half way through the journey, the party arrives south of [Raven's Hold](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/raven-s-hold.md>), and stops early to scout. Flying above the fort and castle, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) sees no signs of habitation. A mass grave outside the [dwarven outpost](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dwarven-outpost-raven-s-hold.md>) is the only new change since the party was last here, many months ago. Recalling the news from [Tharn Todor](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/tharn-todor.md>), the party infers this must been the remains of [Inakara](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/inakara.md>) and her kin, the worshippers of mind flayers slain by [Magran Boulderbeard](<../../../people/dwarves/magran-boulderbeard.md>) and a company of [Dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) some months ago. 

The next day, the [Bahrazel](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>) answer [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s prayers. In her morning prayers, she is briefly transported, seeing a vision of [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) in camp, waking and immediately reaching for his sword, when his hands are grasped by those of an old [dwarf](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>), and a voice in Dwarven echos, saying, "No. You are free," as the sword turns to a snake and begins to slither away, before shattering to dust. Scrying over the course of the day reveals [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) unsettled and deep in thought, and then blaming [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) for the curse, advocating for immediate war. This prompts the party to reach out via Sending, apologizing for the party's mistake in gifting him the sword, saying they had no knowledge of its curse, to which [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) can only reply: "Shit. Really?" The [Bahrazel](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>) also, during the course of the journey, answer some of the parties questions. 

A week after leaving the camp at Lastlight Falls, the party arrives outside the [Stormcaller Tower](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>), where [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>)'s storm has grown in strength and size, now stretching several miles across the plains. The rain has turned the ground to mud and water pools everywhere. 

![Hralgar Storm Nov 1748](../../../assets/hralgar-storm-nov-1748.png)

Between [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s clairvoyance and [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)'s ability to commune with nature and the land, it is clear that [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) is lost more deeply in his mind than before, and the storm is more intense. The eye that previously left the tower open to the sky is gone, and lightning and thunder echos from the clouds. 

We end as the party contemplates their next move, and whether a journey into the [Dreamworld](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/proximate-realms/dreamworld.md>) is necessary to calm [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) and allow them to approach.

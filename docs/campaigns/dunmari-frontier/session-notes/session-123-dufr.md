The party narrowly escapes shadowy pursuit, frees the archfey [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) at the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>), and restores hope to [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>) before journeying home.

## Session Info
### Summary
- The group escapes Red Sun Watch's deadly darkness, with [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) making a heroic solo dash to rejoin his allies.
- Following a magical trail, the party flees across [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>) on griffins and wyvern, evading relentless shadow beasts through speed, invisibility, and strategic maneuvering.
- Arriving at the hidden [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>), they fend off warg archers and shadow creatures while preparing to release [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) from her prison.
- [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) telekinetically lifts and plunges [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>)'s crystal prison into the shimmering pool, triggering a tense standoff with encroaching foes.
- [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s powerful Sunburst banishes the attacking shadows, and [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) emerges—restored, grateful, and imbued with sorrowful wisdom.
- [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) is gifted a magical hat for future planar return, and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) breaks the cursed crown's old bonds, rededicating it to liberate [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>)'s oppressed.
- With the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>)'s guidance, the party crosses the Rainbow Bridge, leaving the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/feywild.md>) for [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>) and their awaiting airship.

## Narrative

Our session begins beneath the shattered tower of [Redsun Watch](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>), with the party in the radiant hall illuminated by [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)’s conjured sunlight. The room, now filled with echoes of sunset and shifting reflections, cast forth visions—the ancient towers lined against the ever-twilight border, the drifting [Cloud Palace](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/cloud-palace.md>), and the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>): a swirling pyramid of cloud and color, its basin brimming with liquid radiance. 

With the keep above cloaked in oppressive, physical darkness and a dread entity still channeling shadows from [Hollowdark](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/hollowdark.md>), the party weighed their escape options. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) fled via Dimension Door, but [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) was forced to escape by flight. He sped alone through the halls, pressed in by unnatural gloom and the flicker of unseen terrors. Guided by his boots of speed and his sharp wits, he raced to the roof, where swarming darkness tried to seize him. Shadowy hands erupted from below; [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) dodged their grasp, even as necrotic energies struck him silent. Still, with one last desperate effort, he burst free, and landed amidst his allies outside the keep, as new winged horrors began to stir in the distant shadows.

After escaping the supernatural darkness, the party gathers and swiftly resaddles their mounts—three griffins and a wyvern. Their task is clear: to reach the [Prismwell](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/prismwell.md>), a legendary site now hidden by an immense, inverted tornado of cloud, summoned by lighting a beacon. Although it cannot be seen from here, the visions provide a clear enough description for [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>): he conjures a magical arrow, fires it into the sky, and a shimmering trail of sunset-lit footprints guides them southwest.

Mounting up, the group follows the trail, but soon spot three vast shadow beasts winging after them in relentless pursuit. Realizing these foes are steadily gaining, the party devises a plan. Rizwynn uses her dwarven rune to cast Longstrider on the wyvern and two griffins, granting them bursts of speed. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), with their griffins, become invisible and break away, hoping to scatter the pursuers.

The wyvern distracts the shadows with a dramatic aerial display while the others streak ahead. The ruse succeeds—the shadow creatures fixate on the wyvern and lose track of the invisible members. Seeker and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) later transform themselves and their griffins into sparrows, completely blending into the local fauna for safety.

Those in the lead continue along the river, the land’s colors intensifying as they near their goal. Wargs and duskhounds attempt to intercept from below, but the party ascends, surging high above their range. At last, the clouds part to reveal the radiant pyramid of the Prismwell gleaming beneath them. The party descends, regrouping as all reach sanctuary before their pursuers can close in.

As the party gathered within the shifting wall of clouds, they weighed their options with little time to spare; distant hunters were surely closing in. Seeking to free the powerful being known as Cloudspinner, they decided to retrieve her crystalline prison from the depths of the portable hole. While initial attempts to physically invert the hole were discussed, Seeker instead used a telekinetic spell to carefully lift the heavy crystal from its confines. Once elevated, the shimmering prison was guided to hover over a pool of silvery, mist-like liquid.

With tense anticipation, Seeker released his magical hold, and the crystal prison dropped into the pool and vanished from sight. For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Then, the sharp whistle of arrows cut through the clouds; two struck harmlessly against Riswynn’s armor and narrowly missed Kenzo as hostile archers emerged from hidden positions. Meanwhile, tendrils of blackness began encroaching at the cloud’s edge.

Riswynn advanced through featureless mist toward the sound of threatening creatures and, sensing the peril, unleashed a mighty Sunburst. Its brilliance cut through the haze, targeting the direction of the spectral howls. Delwath summoned a vigilant insect spirit to orbit defensively overhead. Kenzo reached out with his senses and discerned three shadowy beings pressing against the resistance of the cloud barrier, with a cluster of warg-mounted foes farther out, straining to force their way in.

The group braced for confrontation, eyes fixed on the pool where Cloudspinner had vanished.

As Riswynn unleashed a searing Sunburst against the looming shadow creatures, the unnatural clouds overhead ignited in light, burning away the tendrils of darkness that threatened to break through. Amidst the fading gloom, a figure descended: the Cloudspinner, ancient archfey and ruler of Amberglow, now wreathed in clouds and blazing colors. Her arrival is marked by exhaustion and a shimmering intensity, her presence overwhelming in both power and sorrow for what has befallen her realm.

Seeker, overcome with reverence, kneels as the spirit of Lady Eventide departs. The Cloudspinner addresses the party, offering gratitude and a promise: they will always be welcome in Amberglow. With a gesture, she grants Wellby a shimmering, color-changing hat—an enchanted key allowing the party to return here by magic. 

Riswynn seeks counsel about the [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>). The Cloudspinner explains the need for a worthy purpose, that the crown’s bonds of domination can be unraveled only by dedicating it to a new cause. Riswynn, resolved to aid the oppressed orcs and foster new communities, places the crown on her head. Light flares out, severing countless bonds of control; a great burden lifts from her, while the crown’s shape settles into something more grounded and real.

The Cloudspinner answers questions about portals and passageways out of her domain, directing the party to known gateways. Parting words are exchanged, and with the Rainbow Bridge, the party returns to [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), reuniting with their crew and airship above the dusty plain. The session ends as the company regroups, ready to chart their next course.

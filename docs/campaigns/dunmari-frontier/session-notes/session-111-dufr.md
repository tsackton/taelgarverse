## Narrative
The party returned to [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>) after their recent adventures, bringing with them a massive crystal block containing the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>) in suspended animation, among [other treasure](<../hoards/ra-ghemdros-hoard.md>) from the black dragon [Ra'ghemdros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/ra-ghemdros.md>). They reunited with [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), and the crew of [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), who were eager to hear about their exploits. They unloaded their treasure and discussed dividing it, while joking about potential uses for the magical items.

After sorting through the treasure, the party began making preparations for their next steps. [Milo Thistlefoot](<../../../people/halflings/milo-thistlefoot.md>) and Tilly Brineheart decided to leave the group, intending to sail west and track down their former crew. Two halfling crew members, Willow Copperharp and Mica Copperharp, chose to stay with the party for a while. The remaining crew discussed their course of action regarding [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>) and [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>)'s phylactery—a plain adamantine dagger—and debated the risks of taking [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>) into the city. They ultimately decided to set course towards [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), planning to scout and gather information once they arrived.

As they approached [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), the party discussed their strategy for entering the city. They considered scouting and scrying to gather information, recalling that the city was overgrown and potentially inhabited by skeletal undead. They also weighed the risks of flying over the river versus approaching from the west. They discussed how to deal with Apollyon's doppelgangers, deciding to use scrying to better understand their enemies' positions and to minimize risk as much as possible.

The party finalized their preparations for approaching Drankor, deciding on their tactics. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) cast Hero's Feast, granting themselves and key crew members immunity to fear, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) scryed on their doppelgangers, locating them at the docks. The party planned to use invisibility and misdirection to gain an advantage, hoping to defeat the doppelgangers one by one rather than facing them all at once. They decided to maintain a cautious approach while preparing for potential confrontation.

Upon reaching the outskirts of Drankor, the party spotted notable landmarks, such as the Teeth of Drankor and the Temple of the [Eight Divines](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>). They used scrying to locate [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s doppelganger on one of the towers and considered teleporting directly to confront him. Meanwhile, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) sensed Wellby's presence near the docks, preparing an ambush. The party debated their options, eventually deciding to move cautiously to avoid triggering the city's defenses while they strategized how best to isolate and confront their enemies. The session ended as the party made their final preparations for a confrontation in [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>).

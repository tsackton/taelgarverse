## Narrative
We begin as [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) arrives in the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/feywild.md>), in a meadow of flowers that bloom and unfurl into butterflies as their petals open, taking wing and blowing away. Getting his bearings, with the help of [Typhina](<../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) and the maps and notes of [Ulfgar Frostbeard](<../../../people/dwarves/ulfgar-frostbeard.md>), from [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) stands trying to look confident in this strange place. A giggle from nearby turns out to come from a small fairy, a pixie, who warns [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) he must have the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>)’s permission to travel through his domain of [Fortune's Rest](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/fortune-s-rest.md>), and invites him to come to court, by way of polymorphing him into a dragonfly. 

The court itself is a vast, elegant outdoor casino, staffed by beautiful [Fey](<../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) in white robes, and filled with games of chance of all kinds. A band of satyrs plays a lively tune, and food and drink flow freely. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) wanders, avoiding food and drink and watching the games, until eventually watching a lizard race and deciding to bet. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) bets on one of the losers, and suffers an explosion of black sticky ooze in his face with a rancid, bitter taste as a consequence, but manages to avoid any more severe effects.

Eventually [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) begins to wander towards the palace in the center of the gardens, although it seems difficult to leave the games and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) ends up wandering for some unknown stretch of time before finding himself in a formal garden just outside the palace. The flowers here do not have normal flowers, but rather dense lobes of light of burnished gold, glowing. Somewhat impulsively, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) reaches out and touches one, which bursts in a flash of light, blinding him.

A quick casting of dispel magic removes the blindness, but catches the attention of the [Prince of Luck](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>). The music stops, and he confronts [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), but quickly forgives him, and asks him to come tell his story at court. After some back and forth, discussing what [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) wants and where he came from, the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>) offers [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) a chance to roll for his favor. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), in a moment of pure chutzpah, decides to use his magic dice to try to win, rolling two six sided dice for a total of thirteen. For a moment it seems as if the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>) will be angry, but then he decides to reward [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) for his attempt. 

We end as [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) rests in the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>)’s court, after agreeing to help resolve the wild magic storm growing on the border of Fortune’s Rest, in exchange for safe passage across the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>)’s domain.

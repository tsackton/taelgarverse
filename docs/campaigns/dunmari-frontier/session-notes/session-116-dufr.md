## Narrative

We begin as the party teleports to the Temple of the Eight Divines in [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), where [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) and his allies, a chalyte knight and seven Chardonian war wizards, unexpected await the party, poised for battle. The tension is palpable as the confrontation begins. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)’s _Soul Sight_ reveals [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>)’s enhanced power, emanating from the sinister [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>) upon his head. Magical tendrils extend from the crown to various points, including into the [Mirror of Soul Trapping](<../treasure/mirror-of-soul-trapping.md>) and the chalyte knight. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) wastes no time, unleashing a _Fireball_ from the Necklace of Fireballs, damaging [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) and the war wizards but failing to kill them.

Fausto counters with a spell, eluding [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s _Counterspell_ and taking control of the battlefield. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) falls victim to [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>)’s domination, compelled to attack [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) with a devastating _Rune of Psychic Disruption_. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) collapses, incapacitated, although [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) resists a similar charm from [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>). [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) attempts to blind [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) with a precision arrow, wounding him but failing to disrupt his vision. Meanwhile, the war wizards target Kenzo, but their attacks falter. Delwath summons a pack of spectral lynxes, which tear through the war wizards, significantly thinning their ranks. The chalyte knight charges Kenzo, knocking him back but failing to keep him down. Kenzo retaliates, dispelling Fausto’s magic on [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) with his cleansing touch and landing a flurry of blows on Fausto. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) begins to recover, ready to rejoin the fray.

---

Fausto laughs grimly as Kenzo’s relentless attacks, which should kill him, only sever one of the gray magical tendrils extending from the [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>). Each blow causes another tendril to snap, revealing the Crown's ability to protect [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) from death. Although Seeker disrupts [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>)’s spellcasting with a timely _Counterspell_, frustrating his efforts to regain control of the battlefield, without taking the [Crown of Purity](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>), it seems the battle cannot be won by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>). 

The party shifts focus, attempting to take the Crown from Fausto. Seeker attempts to dislodge it using _Catapult_ with a chain net, Fausto dodges, leaving the attack to hit the chalyte knight. Riswynn follows with an attack with _[Shatterstorm](<../treasure/shatterstorm.md>)_, aiming to force the crown loose through sheer force, but it remains fixed. Wellby’s sleight-of-hand attempt also fails, leaving the party to consider alternative strategies.

[Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) casts _Sleep_, successfully incapacitating [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) temporarily. However, when Delwath attempts to remove the crown, he suffers massive psychic backlash, throwing him 40 feet and dealing significant damage. The chalyte knight awakens Fausto, reigniting the battle.

Kenzo seizes the opportunity to grab the Crown of Purity, using Seeker’s inspiration to overcome its defenses. After a brief struggle, the crown settles on Kenzo’s head, severing its connection to Fausto and the chalyte knight. The knight kneels before Kenzo, acknowledging his new authority. Fausto’s life force fades as the crown’s power abandons him, leaving his body lifeless.

---

With the crown’s influence in hand, Kenzo commands its network of controlled individuals. He orders Marius Cusico, the Chardonian general, to surrender and retreat from [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>). Testing his control, he directs the chalyte knight into a meditative pose and issues reforms to Chardonian bureaucrats tied to the chalyte trade, urging societal restructuring and reparations.

The party debates the morality of wielding the crown’s power, with concerns about its influence over Kenzo. Riswynn proposes testing its effects, leading to Kenzo relinquishing the crown. When Riswynn attunes to it, Kenzo collapses as the crown drains his life force. The party stabilizes him, but he is unable to reattune to the crown.

Through Wellby’s ancestral memory, the party learns the crown predates human settlement of the continent, and has been both a tool for benevolence and a weapon of destruction. Halfling lore reveals the crown transfers ownership only upon the death or defeat of its previous wielder.

Under [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)’s attunement, her aura remains unchanged, reassuring the party of her integrity. She maintains Kenzo’s orders for dismantling the chalyte trade but promises to wield the crown responsibly. The group discusses destroying the crown to prevent future harm, with [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) advocating for a delay to ensure reforms are enacted first.

---

Preparations turn to Apollyon’s tomb. Seeker uses _Clairvoyance_ to scout its interior, describing a massive statue of [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), rows of dark pillars, and an altar in an unfinished space adorned with murals and statues. The red mist surrounding the tomb’s base, remembered as a remnant of Cha'mutte’s plague, does not enter the structure. Wellby receives a message from [Sura](<../../../people/dunmari/sura.md>) detailing an unexpected truce: General Cusico has called for an end to hostilities in the Chardon-Dunmari War though a rogue contingent of soldiers and wizards may still pose a threat.

The party rests, preparing to enter the tomb the following morning.

---

The journey through [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>) is marked by Riswynn’s holy magic, which clears lingering undead from their path. Upon reaching the tomb, the party flies to its domed roof, discovering an unguarded door. Descending a spiral staircase, they emerge on the ground floor, near a colossal statue of [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>). The dimly lit space is oppressive, with flickering light filtering through the dome casting long shadows among rows of black pillars and ominous side chapels.

Kenzo activates his aura abilities, detecting Apollyon’s presence in the room. From behind the statue, Apollyon rises, clad in frayed imperial robes. His ghastly appearance—a face scarred red, glowing eyes, and an aura of necrotic energy—commands attention. Floating 50 feet above the ground, Apollyon mocks the party, proclaiming himself a god and warning them that their souls are now bound to his tomb.

The party launches an attack, but Apollyon deflects Wellby’s arrow with his aura, showcasing his defensive power. Delwath engages, only to be cursed by Apollyon’s hatred of elves. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) casts _Sunburst_, dealing radiant damage despite [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) twisting the magic to mitigate its full effect. Seeker’s summoned metal construct lands several blows, but Apollyon retaliates with a command spell, forcing Kenzo to kneel.

Blinded by Wellby’s second arrow, Apollyon transforms into mist, retreating through the floor into his inner sanctum. Before disappearing, he turns to Delwath, issuing a word of power that instantly kills him. As Apollyon’s presence fades, the party quickly revives Delwath with Riswynn’s _Revivify_. The session ends with the group contemplating their next move, resolved to track Apollyon deeper into his tomb.

**(Wednesday, July 28th, 2021; in Taelgar, May 29th to June 1st)

Our session begins at dusk, as the party silent, tired, stands before the dead bodies of [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) Dustmother and her oni servant, [Samerki](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/samerki.md>). As [Cintra](<../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>) rushes to comfort her daughter, [Jumi](<../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>), in relief and also terror at what [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) has turned her into, the party takes stock.

While [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) goes to scout into the slot canyon that leads to the exit from the Wellspring and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) begins his ritual to activate Elmerica’s Sight, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) removes a [small pearl](<../treasure/treasure-from-raven-s-hold/pearl-of-power.md>) from his back, concentrates for a moment, and then goes to [Jumi](<../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>) and attempts to unweave the magic that has turned her mostly into a wooden puppet. While a challenging task, he succeeds in doing so, and the party sees the wood melting away from her. [Cintra](<../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>), overwhelmed with gratitude, throws her arms around [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) as [Jumi](<../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>) tries to climb into his lap.

Meanwhile, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) begins a slow, careful investigation of what is on [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) and [Samerki](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/samerki.md>)’s bodies. There is a lot to sort through, and it takes some time, with the results of the initial search and subsequent study summarized [elsewhere](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1XcqGxM3Uor1lar62nkDjTKPlS3jjLWfZaGU35WGxjGM/edit).

As [Cintra](<../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>) emerges from her tent, having just gotten [Jumi](<../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>) to sleep, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) hears a noise from the slot canyon, of something falling into the pit trap. With only a few moments for some healing magic, the party prepares for combat. With the fire elemental, still around from the battle with [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>), blocking the exit from the slot canyon, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) throwing the gnoll archers arrows back at them, a well-targeted use of [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)’s magical green flame blade, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) animating a boulder to attack, [Shakun](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>)’s aid in the form of [Cintra](<../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>)’s bless spell, and some carefully aimed arrows from [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), the party manages to hold off the gnoll excursion. Particularly effective is a combination of [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) turning the canyon floor to quicksand, holding a number of the creatures in place for [Drikod](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/drikod.md>)’s flaming sphere to burn over and over again.

As the combat ends and the party recovers, and realizes that [Jumi](<../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>) slept through the whole thing across the canyon in [Cintra](<../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>)’s tent, the fire elemental burns the bodies as their last act before returning to their native [Elemental Plane of Fire](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-plane-of-fire.md>), but not before confirming by the last gnoll’s reaction to [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s dead body that they did in fact work for [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>). 

The party and [Cintra](<../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>) talk into the night about the nature of the [Shakun’s Wellspring](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/shakuns-wellspring.md>), [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s magic, and more. [Cintra](<../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>) shares what she knows of the Wellspring -- it is an ever-changing land of hard to navigate terrain, a place where those who try to defeat [Shakun](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>)’s protections along the eastern border of [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) find themselves wandering, until they die of hunger or thirst. 

While the party quickly agrees that investigating [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s lair would be a worthy goal and an important next step, the first priority is getting [Cintra](<../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>), [Jumi](<../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>), and [Heart of Shakun](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/heart-of-shakun.md>) back to [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). The journey back is a little slow, as the horses have vanished, led back to [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) by [Baxter](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/companions/baxter.md>) after the party failed to return to camp in time, and [Jumi](<../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>) can only walk so fast. But after two days of travel, the party arrives in [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). 

In [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), [Cintra](<../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>) and [Jumi](<../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>) vanish to deal with [Heart of Shakun](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/heart-of-shakun.md>), while the party is approached by [Candrosa](<../../../people/dunmari/candrosa.md>). [Candrosa](<../../../people/dunmari/candrosa.md>) is overjoyed, profusing thanking the party and telling them they have saved him from his greatest mistake. He also shares the news that a group of Chardonians passed through a few days before, coming out of the desert and heading west. He promises to return later with whatever stories about [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) and especially her lair he can glean from the folks currently in town.

After talking to [Candrosa](<../../../people/dunmari/candrosa.md>), the party speaks with [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>), about the Chardonians. At [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>)’s camp is also [Baxter](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/companions/baxter.md>), newly equipped with his axebeak armor. Finally, they turn to speak with [Tharandros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/tharandros.md>), who is pleased with the parties actions, not so much for what they did for [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) and [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), but their work in removing now two great evils from the land (the demon in [Raven's Hold](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/raven-s-hold.md>) and [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) Dustmother). [Tharandros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/tharandros.md>) tells them his people must continue their delayed migration north, but to leave a message with any passing centaur if they learn more of the evils, curses, and disease still lying on the [Plaguelands](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/plaguelands.md>). He is not particularly concerned with the doings of gods, but is and remains very concerned about the sickness that seems to still linger there. As they part, [Tharandros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/tharandros.md>) tells them that the future is clouded and many paths from this point are possible, but that he feels strangely optimistic. 

Finally, the party returns to camp. Before discussing their next steps, they show the [Scepter of Command](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/scepter-of-command.md>) to [The Mirror of the Past](<../treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/the-mirror-of-the-past.md>), receiving [a vision of its creation and past](<../mirror-visions/scepter-of-command-vision.md>). 

After discussion of what they just saw, and everything that has happened, the party ultimately decides that at this point they need knowledge and lore, and the obvious place to look is [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), where [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) has connections to the [Lakan Mystai](<../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/lakan-mystai.md>), and which is also one of the oldest cities in [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) and home to a significant library. With that, the party sets camp and prepares for sleep.

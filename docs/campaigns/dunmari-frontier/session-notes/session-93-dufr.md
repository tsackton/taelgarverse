## Narrative
We begin as the party arrives in dramatic fashion at the Vargaldi camp, nestled within the foreboding yet majestic northern forests, courtesy of their flying castle [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). This spectacle did not go unnoticed by the local inhabitants, who, revealing their ability to transform from animals into humanoid forms, approached with a mix of curiosity and caution. Delwath, in a bid to bridge the communication gap, cycled through languages—Common, Deno'qai—before resorting to the Tongues spell to articulate their peaceful intentions and announce the return of lost Vargald members. This introduction sparked a dialogue with [Jotha](<../../../people/deno-qai/jotha.md>), a woman from the camp, who expressed concerns about the visibility of their ship potentially attracting a dragon's gaze to their haven. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), acknowledging these fears, employed magic to camouflage the flying castle, thereby mitigating the perceived threat and earning a cautious gratitude from the Vargald.

In the ensuing interactions, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) and [Jotha](<../../../people/deno-qai/jotha.md>) delved into discussions about her origins, while [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) telepathically conversed with Vargald halfling siblings about their ancestral ties and dragon lore. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)'s inquiries led him to discuss the animal spirits the Vargaldi worship, known as the [Zariya](<../../../cosmology/religions/northern-folk-religions/zariya.md>), and to learn  the recent dragon incursions were from Vimfrost's mountains—a region abandoned by frost giants. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and the party pondered the dragons' motives, while [Jotha](<../../../people/deno-qai/jotha.md>) shared her puzzling displacement in time since her abduction two years prior. The party, assessing the potential dragon threat, explored the camp's defenses and engaged with the Vargald on various fronts, from discussing evacuation plans to the logistics of trade and the valuation of dragon parts.

By late afternoon, the sighting of a dragon circling nearby mountains catapulted the party into strategic debates. They weighed the dragon's diurnal patterns, their ability to outrun it, and the merits of a confrontational approach versus a strategic retreat. Opting for caution, they invited the Vargald to seek refuge on their ship while planning an ambush. As twilight descended, the party, having spread out in preparation, faced the dragon and its unexpected allies—two giant snow constructs. Despite the complexity of the battle, marred by debate over the efficacy of stealth and invisibility against such a formidable foe, they emerged victorious. The dragon's defeat was marked by a collective effort, culminating in [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s decisive Guiding Bolt, while Dewalth and Wellby managed the threat posed by the self-destructive snow constructs.

In the aftermath, as they harvested valuable parts from their fallen adversary, the party reflected on the battle's dynamics and the advantages conferred by aerial combat. With the dragon and constructs dispatched, and valuable resources in hand, they turned their attention to the Vargald community, who welcomed them back as heroes.

The subsequent interaction with the Vargald was a blend of celebration and strategic planning. The party discussed navigating relationships with other clans, delving into soul-severing lore to combat a nemesis named [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), and the logistics of approaching [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>) while maintaining their disguise. They debated infiltration strategies, the use of invisibility, and the logistics of learning the local language, ultimately deciding to spend two weeks preparing with the Vargald for their reconnaissance mission to the trade city. We end as the party rests for the night.

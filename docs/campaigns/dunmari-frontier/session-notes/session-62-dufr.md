## Narrative
We begin our adventure in the [Vermillion Isles](<../../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/vermillion-isles.md>), in the port town of [Wahacha](<../../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/wahacha.md>), in the [Dolphin’s Rest Inn](<../../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/dolphins-rest-inn.md>), an establishment popular with sailors and other ‘grounders’  who visit [Wahacha](<../../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/wahacha.md>), as it sits at the bottom of the steep red sea cliffs that define the islands, instead of nestled among the sides and tops of the cliffs like many of the kenku buildings. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) is introduced to [Rufus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/rufus.md>), [Artem Novolozek](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/artem-novolozek.md>), [Alimash](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/alimash.md>), and [Shoal](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/shoal.md>), all come together here to discuss the problem of the recent raids. After introductions, the group sets out quickly to the spot, about 40 miles to the east on the edge of the ~Eastern Ocean~, where the raiders are believed to come from.

After an uneventful day of sailing, the party comes to the likely location they are seeking, seeing both a wrecked ship and several small longboats at anchor above what looks like a large underwater island, a sea mount that nearly reaches the surface. From maybe 200 feet below the water, a faint green glow can be seen. After help from [Artem](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/artem-novolozek.md>) to allow everyone who cannot already breath water to do so, the party dives down. 

They enter an underwater cave, and proceed along to a boulder blocking the entrance to a larger complex, from which the greenish light is leaking. The boulder is easy enough to move, although [Alimash](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/alimash.md>) is nearly blinded by the fungal rot growing on it while shoving it aside. 

As the party descends into the cave, the first thing they see are three humans riding giant sharks, seemingly jousting with each other; meanwhile, a giant fan slowly spins in the middle of the floor, pulling fresh water from the sea into the cave itself. The sailors seem dazed, or enchanted, and immediately attack, after first turning the fan speed up so it begins to create a swirling current pulling any who get too close into the blades. 

The party engages in combat, and manages to defeat all the sharks and sailors, although realizes as the sailors die they are unable to breath, and suffocate. The party manages to save one of them via keeping them unconscious until [Artem](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/artem-novolozek.md>) can cast Water Breathing. Speaking to this sailor, he can’t seem to remember much of the past few weeks, but warns them what is waiting below. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) lures a fish into range, bribes it with food, and beast senses in its mind to scout below, seeing first a chamber with the kenku prisoners, a massive shark, and a few more sailors, and then below a  giant tentacles aboleth lurking around a massive crystal prison holding an enormous creature, only one eye of which can occasionally be seen. But then the fish is eaten by the aboleth. 

Proceeding down, after turning off the spinning blades, the party attacks the shark. The battle turns, however, when they realize that there is a mage hiding in the mouth of the shark, who gets off a few deadly spells before [Artem](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/artem-novolozek.md>) polymorphs the shark into a turtle, taking it out of the combat. Eventually, though, the mage is subdued and the prisoners temporarily rescued. But the tentacled aboleth continues to attack through the floor below.

The party descends to its lair, and combat begins, as the aboleth attempts to lure its attackers via images of their greatest desires. Magic and weapons fly as the party works to bring this creature down, along with three enslaved sea elf knights. [Shoal](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/shoal.md>) and [Artem](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/artem-novolozek.md>) resist attempts to be lured into visions, and the party manages to largely shrug off attempts to charm them. Until near the end of the battle, [Rufus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/rufus.md>) succumbs to the psychic coral, falling unconscious as a vision of a world without crabs appears before him and then is cruelly taken away. And as the aboleth is nearing death, it manages to charm [Alimash](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/alimash.md>) to fight on its side, although this does not last long, as with a blast of lightning [Artem](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/artem-novolozek.md>) kills the beast before it can get full control of [Alimash](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/alimash.md>)’s mind. 

We end as the aboleth falls to the floor of the cave, [Rufus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/rufus.md>) unconscious but stabilized by [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), and the prisoners dazed as they come out of their enslavement.

### Timeline
- May 18, 1749 DR, afternoon: Head inland from the beach on the ~Circular Island~; find a camp with water and food runes; reach pilgrimage location near the statue of [the Wanderer](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wanderer.md>)

## Narrative
We begin in the afternoon, as the Dunmar Fellowship reaches the singing sand beach of the ~Circular Island~, having struggling through the permanent storms that encircle the island on the Folding Boat, captained by [Milo Thistlefoot](<../../../people/halflings/milo-thistlefoot.md>). Milo, Tilly Brineheart, and the halfling crew leave the party on the shore, and head back out to sea to circumnavigate the island and explore. 

From the beach, there is not much to see, although [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) notices the sand seems to faintly sing in the wind, a melody that [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) recognizes as Elvish, although too soft to hear the words. The party climbs up the cliffs -- [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) noting that the cliffs seem to be intentionally shaped to look like windswept, eroded crags -- and scouts from the top. Looking across the island, there is a strange, red burned scar a few miles inland, towards the forest; divine [ley lines](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/ley-lines.md>) that run from the statues of the [Eight Divines](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) inland; and a clear dragonet presence that [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) can sense to the north, near the partially ruined towers. 

The party decides to head towards the statue of [the Wanderer](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wanderer.md>), to the north. After traveling for a few miles, they encounter the ancient remains of what seems to have been a camp. Little is left, except for three faintly magical circles of runes marking with strange writing spelling the words "Water", "Food", and "Warmth." 

Continuing to travel north, the party reaches a perfectly straight road, leading from [the Wanderer](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wanderer.md>) statue inland, paved with white stones and at least 20 feet wide, wide enough for many people to walk abreast. [The Wanderer](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wanderer.md>) statue is only a short walk from here; reaching the statue, the party finds the remains of what seems to be a hostel for pilgrims, and small temple complex. Although largely destroyed, the bronze doors still stand, engraved with a motif of the ~Circular Island~ with legs, striding through the ocean, priests and wizards above and the [Eight Divines](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) watching over it from the sky. 

In the pilgrimage hostel, there is a small statue of [the Wanderer](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wanderer.md>), and a well, that remain intact. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) finds a latch that opens the back of the statue, revealing ancient prayers written on sheets of metal or stone or clay. While many are no longer readable, the ones that are -- written in Elvish and Drankorian -- paint a picture of pilgrims offering prayers of thanksgiving and asking for support on their pilgrimage. 

The session ends in the early afternoon, as the party speculates on the nature of the island, releasing it must have originally been a refuge used by the survivors of the Downfall Wars to flee the sinking of Hkar, and then later it became a pilgrimage site to, they presume, the [Eight Divines](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) of [Mos Numena](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>), the major human religion of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>).

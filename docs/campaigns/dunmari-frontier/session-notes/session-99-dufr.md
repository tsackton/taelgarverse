## Narrative
Our session begins at dawn, in the harbor of [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), where the[Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) prepares to set sail on the halfling ship [Summer's Breeze](<../../../things/ships/summer-s-breeze.md>), captained by [Pippa Goodbarrow](<../../../people/halflings/pippa-goodbarrow.md>), and guided, in part, by the human fisherman and navigator [Martino](<../../../people/chardonians/martino.md>). With the outgoing tide, the party sets sail, making good speed. The party is aiming to find [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>), a stoneborn hermit, who may be able to provide a magical way to breath water, allowing the party to search for the merfolk and the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../treasure/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>). [Martino](<../../../people/chardonians/martino.md>) suggests that Calcara Island, an uninhabited, rocky island off the coast, might be a good place for hermit, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) confirms this by speaking with the [tanshi](<../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/tanshi.md>). 

As the [Summer's Breeze](<../../../things/ships/summer-s-breeze.md>) approaches the northern end of Calcara Island, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) is able to sense the stoneborn's presence nearby, and a little bit of searching, guided by a friendly gannet and a playful seal, reveals the entrance to [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>)'s cave. Rowing into the cave illuminated by an eerie blue light, they encounter a dock with steps leading up to a stoneborn hermit who questions their presence.

![Kazuro Cave V2](../../../assets/kazuro-cave-v2.jpg)

The stone-born hermit, [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>), appears annoyed and grumpy at the interruption. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) apologizes for the intrusion and explains their quest, mentioning they heard of [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>) in [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), and explaining their need for water-breathing to reach the [Merfolk](<../../../species/unusual-species/merfolk.md>). Despite a stony reception, [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>) invites the party to follow him, expressing frustration at favor-seekers. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) attempts to interest [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>) by offering stories that could echo into the future, and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) compliments [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>)’s hermitage, expressing the party’s noble intentions, but [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>) is unswayed, if not entirely unsympathetic. 

[Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>) questions the party's origins and their reasons for requesting his help. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) shares the party members' origins, emphasizing their quest to prevent an impending evil. [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>) shows mixed emotions, including curiosity and hidden trauma, when [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) mentions fighting great evil, mentioning he has seen battle and loss in the War of the Dark Rift. 

[Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) offers to establish a monastery to preserve [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>)’s teachings and extend his legacy. Intrigued and pleased by the offer, [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>) expresses his long-held wish to build a small school. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) suggests finding an apprentice for [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>), emphasizing the party’s journey and connections. This seems to sway [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>), and with the party's offer of aid in preserving his legacy, he begins pulling together the magical ingredients needed to produce the water breathing potions. He offers the party six doses of this concoction, which can transform lungs into gills, along with an antidote that can transform back. Taking the concoctions, the party departs, with a promise to return. 

Turning north, the party sails for two days under fair skies and following seas, heading for Tamaro Bay. After 48 hours of sailing, they approach the bay, noting a crude watchtower made of driftwood facing west, on an island off the coast. Wellby scouts, finding a man with  sunburned skin, matted hair, and worn-out clothes rooting for food on the leeward side of the island. 

![Tamaro Island](../../../assets/tamaro-island.png)

Approaching the hermit, the party realizes he is confused, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), with magic, senses his thoughts are muddled, consuming by repeating a song in a strange language. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) notices his eyes are strange, and seem to have crashing waves in them. Realizing this must be some kind of curse or magic, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) manages to dispel the effect, and the hermit's demeanor shifts as he thanks the party. The [hermit](<../../../people/chardonians/dorian-almare.md>) reveals he has been on the island for 10 years, unable to recall events clearly due to the magical possession, and mentions the last thing he remembers is the merfolk woman Caloria fleeing from her kin, to the island. He remembers drinking a vial of strange water -- a vial, Seeker learns, that was constructed on a different plane -- but the events are confused. He knows there was some trouble, some conflict, among the merfolk, and he fears Caloria is dead. 

This is confirmed by the party's search, which turns up the bones and golden bracelet of Caloria just offshore, washed up against some rocks. As they talk, the hermit -- whose name is [Dorian Almare](<../../../people/chardonians/dorian-almare.md>) -- recounts fragments of memories about Caloria being chased and leaving him with a sense of regret for drinking the cursed water. The party rests for a short while, and speaks more with Dorian, gaining insights regarding [Merfolk](<../../../species/unusual-species/merfolk.md>) culture and etiquette. Dorian shares that merfolk settlements are west of their current location and hints at a significant event involving a jade garden and a green light. Before leaving, the party ensures Dorian is stable and offers to help him in the future. He refuses immediate travel, needing time to recover.

Returning to the [Summer's Breeze](<../../../things/ships/summer-s-breeze.md>) in the late afternoon, the party proceeds westward, continuing into the night under clear skies. By midnight, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) feels a tug from the jade, indicating they are close yet also far from their destination, as if it's both within 50 miles and infinitely distant. In the early morning hours before dawn, the wind dies completely, leaving the ship adrift in a zone of calm water. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), in a trance, senses a swirling vortex deep in the ocean, a portal to the [Elemental Plane of Water](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-plane-of-water.md>). Telling the crew of the [Summer's Breeze](<../../../things/ships/summer-s-breeze.md>) to sail back east as quickly as possible, the party consumes their water-breathing potions, and dives into the water, experiencing a transformation as they grow gills and initially struggle, then adjust to breathing underwater.

As they descend, they feel a protective barrier and hear the whispers of a Sentient Ocean questioning their presence and intentions. The ocean's chant probes their identities and stories, creating a sense of watchfulness and judgment. The session ends as the party sinks deeper into the ocean, surrounded by these whispers and colors, hearing the echos of the sentient ocean repeating "Who are you?".

#### Traveling to Tamaro Bay
The party departs from Castrella and makes their way to Karkara Island to seek a stone-born hermit for water-breathing resources.
They locate the hermit, Kazuro, who provides a concoction for breathing underwater after being persuaded to help by the party's pledge to preserve his teachings.
As the party prepares to depart, Kenzo discusses his plans for establishing a monastery, revealing his philosophical groundwork and recruitment efforts.
Wellby expresses interest in Kenzo's monastery plans, hinting at possible storytelling modules he could contribute.
The party discusses teleportation logistics and the practicality of using their limited water-breathing concoction.
They decide to travel to Tamaro Bay, estimating a two-day journey under good conditions, with halflings committing to sail around the clock.
During the first leg of the journey, the weather is favorable, and they sail smoothly, aiming to cover 430 miles to their destination.
The party exchanges light-hearted banter and some strategic discussions about teleportation and water-breathing items during the voyage.
On the second day, they approach Tamaro Bay, and the weather remains favorable. The party debates their exact course of action upon arrival.
They notice a wooden structure on a cliff near Tamaro Bay and decide to investigate it, considering it might hold significance.
The structure turns out to be a crude watchtower made of driftwood. They also spot a single-masted row sailboat in a cove on the leeward side of the island.
Wellby offers to scout further to the cove to locate any inhabitants or further clues, while the rest of the party plans their landing strategy.
#### The Mystic of Tamaro Bay
The party lands at a rickety two-story structure with signs of occupation but in poor condition, deciding to explore further.
Wellby scouts ahead, spots a person foraging among the dunes, and describes him as having sunburned skin, matted hair, and worn-out clothes.
The party approaches the hermit cautiously, with Delwath casting Detect Thoughts to gauge the man's surface thoughts, which are in an unrecognized language and are mostly centered around a song.
The hermit, startled by the party’s approach, initially reacts defensively but then reveals thoughts of being haunted by ghostly voices.
Seeker assesses the hermit’s eyes and determines he is under a magical effect, suggesting to dispel it, which Delwath encourages.
Seeker casts Dispel Magic at Fifth Level, successfully removing the magical influence, causing the hermit’s demeanor to shift as he thanks the party.
The hermit reveals he has been on the island for 10 years, unable to recall events clearly due to the magical possession, and mentions fleeing with a merfolk named Caloria.
The party learns the hermit's name is Dorian, realizing he has been guided by Caloria to drink a vial of enchanted ocean water.
Delwath attempts to Scry to find Caloria but fails as it appears the vial of liquid was of a different plane, confirmed by Seeker's examination.
Wellby uses Beast Sense on a fish to investigate an offshore rock, discovering bones, likely merfolk remains, and something metallic shimmering in the water.
Kenzo retrieves a golden bracelet from the offshore rock, which Dorian recognizes, affirming Caloria’s death.
Dorian recounts fragments of memories about Caloria being chased and leaving him with a sense of regret for drinking the cursed water.
The party decides to take a short rest and speaks more with Dorian, gaining insights regarding merfolk culture and etiquette.
Dorian shares that merfolk settlements are west of their current location and hints at a significant event involving a jade garden and a green light.
Before leaving, the party ensures Dorian is stable and offers to help him in the future; he refuses immediate travel, needing time to recover.
The party departs to continue their quest, noting the urgency due to an apocalyptic threat looming in 19 days.
#### Finding the Kelp Garden
The party returns to their boat around 4:30 PM with about an hour and a half of sunlight left. The DM notes that it is a new moon, so it will be dark when the sun sets.
Delwath suggests sailing west, but Wellby points out the importance of observing merfolk lights that may appear at night. The party decides to proceed westward.
Seeker mentions looking out for any moon phase-based hypotheses as the DM describes the journey. The party sails 20 miles as the sun sets, then continues into the night. The sky is clear with visible stars, and Pipa enjoys navigating by them.
By midnight, the party has sailed about 50 miles from the island. Kenzo, who is on watch, feels a tug from the jade, indicating they are close yet also far from their destination, as if it's both within 50 miles and infinitely distant.
At dawn, the wind dies completely, and the ship is adrift in a zone of calm water. Wellby recognizes this as an unusual barrier, suggesting they are close to a portal to the Plane of Water.
The party decides to get into their folding boat to move closer to the portal. They discuss the logistics and eventual departure of their halfling companions and Martina.
Kenzo enters a trance and senses a swirling vortex deep in the ocean, signaling the presence of the portal to the Plane of Water.
The party eats their 'gill pills' and dives into the water, experiencing the transformation as they grow gills and struggle initially, then adjust to breathing underwater.
As they descend, they feel the protective barrier and hear the whispers of a sentient ocean questioning their presence and intentions. The ocean's chant probes their identities and stories, creating a sense of watchfulness and judgment.
The session ends as the party sinks deeper into the ocean, surrounded by these whispers and colors, with the DM hinting at a future mechanic involving character memories to navigate the hall of stories.

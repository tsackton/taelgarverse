## Narrative
We begin late at night, as the shadow hunters mounted on flying gloomstalkers, who have been tracking the party for weeks, reach [Tollen](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) and attack. After hasty preparation, including raising the ice dome on [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), the party met the shadow hunter's charge. As the enemies attacked, the party unleashed spells including Delwath's synaptic static spell and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s slow spell, amidst a flurry of attacks. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)'s melee prowess stunned one shadow hunter, while [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s use of ice daggers proved lethal. Despite a gloomstalker's attempt to escape with [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), the party's combined efforts led to victory. After the battle, the party spoke with Tollen guards who came to investigate;  Delwath explained the attack as an assault by [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) hunters, omitting specifics at [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s advice. 

The next morning, the party discussed their route north with [Kecha](<../../../people/kenku/kecha.md>), the kenku scout. They decided to cross the [Sivnjo Mountains](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/sivnjo-mountains.md>) inland and head toward the Kat river, avoiding the vampire territory along the coast. Over the next few days, the party concluded their business in Tollen, and stocked up on food and warm clothing for the trip north. 

The morning of March 13th, the party departed Tollen after nearly a month in town, with a refitted ship. The journey across [Vostok](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/vostok/vostok.md>) was largely uneventful, the weather cold but clear as the [Sivnjo Mountains](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/sivnjo-mountains.md>) neared. The evening of March 15th, however, brought storm clouds, and March 16th was a day of whiteout snow, forcing the party to remain sheltered. 

Once the storm cleared, they debated their route, considering the rumored [frost giant](<../../../species/children-of-the-divine/giants.md>) presence. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) communicated with birds, learning about the dangers north, including giant wolves and giant people's settlements. Driven by curiosity, the party headed in the direction of these giant's territory. 

Mid-afternoon the next day, on March 17th, the party spotted a group of dwarves emerging from a mine, under the watchful eye of two frost giants mounted on woolly mammoths.

The party debated what to do, as [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)'s communion with nature suggested that while the frost giants were indigenous to this land, they were not wholly in harmony with it. Deciding to talk, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) sent his lynx messenger with a note requesting parlay. The giant -- curious but also on edge -- approached to speak as [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) snuck off under an invisibility spell to try to talk to the dwarves. 

[Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), understanding the giant's language through a spell, negotiated. The giant revealed they were on [Brimskarda](<../../../people/giants/brimskarda.md>)'s land, a powerful frost giant king. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) shared tales of their adventures, impressing the giant, who suggested a meeting with [Brimskarda](<../../../people/giants/brimskarda.md>). The giant wrote an introduction note for [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) to Brimskarda. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) sent a lynx with the note, planning to follow for a proper introduction and potentially negotiate or gather intelligence.

Meanwhile, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) investigated the dwarves, finding no signs of magical control or obvious enslavement. Telepathically communicating with a dwarf, he learned of their distasteful, but in their eyes unavoidable, situation, working as indentured servants for the giants in return for protection from dragons. 

Our session ends the next afternoon, as the party approached the steading of the frost giant king [Brimskarda](<../../../people/giants/brimskarda.md>).

## Narrative
The party decided to explore a little more before entering the ruined fort, and discovered a campsite in the foundations of the outbuildings outside the fort. The camp itself was several days to several weeks old, and had clearly been disturbed by animals (signs of scattered food -- salt pork and dried fish and the like that had been partially eaten by animals). Whoever made the camp had left most of their stuff, except weapons and water, and went somewhere. 

After investigating the camp, the party decided to follow the tracks up the causeway into the fort. Inside, only three buildings still had walls: a central headquarters building, a five-sided temple (which retained a metal roof), and two towers guarding the entryway. In addition, there was an empty cistern, cracked at the bottom. 

Sounds of a large clacking / chittering creature from the central building drew them in. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) began sneaking quietly towards the walls to investigate, as the sounds when quiet momentarily. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) suddenly remembered tales of a large desert monstrosity that hunted by tunneling underground and ambushing prey, but before he could say anything, a giant insect, a cross between a centipede and a preying mantis, burst from underground and grabbed [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) in its mandibles. Despite a few tense moments as [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) was in danger of being eaten, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)’s quick action to whack the creature across the mandibles freed [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), and the ankheg was dispatched by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)’s longsword blow after being knocked prone by [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) excavating the loose earth under its back legs. 

Searching after the battle, the party found a pit in the ground going down into a cave complex, but first decided they needed to rest and recover. Exploring the intact building, they discovered it was a temple to [Five Siblings](<../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>): [Jeevali](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/jeevali.md>), the goddess of life, rebirth, home, and family; [Laka](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/laka.md>), the god of knowledge, agriculture and the seasons, and time; [Aagir](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/aagir.md>), the god of war, fire, and death; [Sonkar](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/sonkar.md>), the goddess of beauty, truth, artisans, and justice; and [Chidya](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/chidya.md>), the goddess of nature, the land, animals, and weather. In this temple, the altar to [Aagir](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/aagir.md>) seemed the most important, and a small [silver spearpoint statue](<../treasure/treasure-from-dunmari-ruins/aagir-s-everlight.md>), engraved with a flame motif and burning with a fire that seemed to have no source of fuel, still stood on the altar. This item radiated evocation magic, and magic was also threaded through the walls of the temple, perhaps giving them more stability and structure. While resting and recovering, a search of the wreckage inside the temple also turned up some heavier religious items (bronze chalices, silver candlesticks, some amulets and small statues). 

After the rest, the party decided to first explore the towers, and then head down into the tunnel. While one tower was full of rubble, the other was more intact, and the party found the remains of a Dunmari solider, possibly a scout, from several hundred years ago. While most of the scout’s items were rotted away, a [magical horn](<../treasure/treasure-from-dunmari-ruins/horn-of-silent-alarm.md>) with an etched running horse design was still in good order. 

Taking the horn and the continual flame spearpoint, the party descended down into the tunnel. It was a low, narrow crawl, until a small cavern containing two exits, and a very lifelike statue of a [human man](<../../../people/chardonians/arcus.md>), wearing a cloak and leather armor, with a dagger in one hand and a torch in an arm that was broken and lying on the ground. Also on the ground was a [golden coin](<../treasure/treasure-from-dunmari-ruins/floating-disc-coin.md>), looking like a Chardonian coin from several hundred years ago, that was unusually heavy and radiated transformation magic. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) flipped the coin, and it turned into a floating disk that hovered 3 feet off the ground, and seemed to follow [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>).

Continuing to explore, the party found what seemed to be a cockatrice nursery, where they found a lion that was continually turning into stone and then back into flesh, while several cockatrice babies pecked at it, or each other, or some large mottled eggs nestled against a muddy pit. Sneaking back unnoticed, they decided to explore the other passageway. After leading under the cracked cistern, the passage opened into a larger cavern, where three skeletons attacked, soon followed by an undead hobgoblin, carried a [Black Iron Staff](<../treasure/treasure-from-dunmari-ruins/black-iron-staff.md>) with a smooth obsidian stone mounted to the top. After defeating the undead, the party realized the obsidian staff must be the source of the abnormal beasts, and managed to destroy it, using both the enchanted spearpoint and a shadowy blade [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) summoned into his hand, aided by [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s insight into a hidden flaw and weak point in the crystal. While the obsidian seemed to resist non-magical damage, a few blows were enough for it to shatter, and calm to prevail, although at the cost of some damaging psychic backlash.

As peace and calm permeated the area after the destruction of the obsidian, the party spent a quiet, restful night in the temple.

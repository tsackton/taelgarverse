## Session Info
### Summary
- The [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) departs [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>) aboard the halfling ship [Emerald Song](<../../../things/ships/emerald-song.md>), destined for [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>).

## Narrative
We begin as the party boards the [Emerald Song](<../../../things/ships/emerald-song.md>), the halfling ship they will sail on to [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>). As the ship departs [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>), the party gets settled and enjoys the view from the deck, before heading to dinner with the captain, some of the crew, and the two other passengers, both halflings.

The party is introduced to the captain, [Harol Silversong](<../../../people/halflings/harol-silversong.md>); the family elder and songkeeper, [Ewen Silversong](<../../../people/halflings/ewen-silversong.md>); the cook, [Pearl Copperharp](<../../../people/halflings/pearl-copperharp.md>); the navigator, [Lyle Honeyhill](<../../../people/halflings/lyle-honeyhill.md>); and the passengers [Jasmine Sunmeadow](<../../../people/halflings/jasmine-sunmeadow.md>) and [Oswalt Tealeaf](<../../../people/halflings/oswalt-tealeaf.md>), a young married couple. [Dani Silversong](<../../../people/halflings/dani-silversong.md>), the quartermaster and chief trader on the ship, is also there. As dinner starts, conversation touches on the rumors of [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) - both of the party’s exploits, and other tales such as a story of an undead attack across the river [Shrev](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/rivers/shrev.md>) to the south. [Oswalt Tealeaf](<../../../people/halflings/oswalt-tealeaf.md>) is a cousin of [Garret Tealeaf](<../../../people/halflings/garret-tealeaf.md>)’s, and quite pleased to learn he is alive. Indeed, it was [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s attack on their caravan that turned him to learning archery; in his wanderings he met [Jasmine Sunmeadow](<../../../people/halflings/jasmine-sunmeadow.md>) outside [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>), and they bonded over a shared love of the wilds and of wandering. [Jasmine Sunmeadow](<../../../people/halflings/jasmine-sunmeadow.md>) grew up the daughter of the innkeepers of [The Green Leaf](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/the-green-leaf.md>), the halfling inn in the harbor in [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>). She liked to wander, to find new plants, and met [Oswalt Tealeaf](<../../../people/halflings/oswalt-tealeaf.md>) in her wanderings. Eventually they got married and decided to go seek adventure.

As dinner ends, [Harol Silversong](<../../../people/halflings/harol-silversong.md>) and [Pearl Copperharp](<../../../people/halflings/pearl-copperharp.md>) take out their instruments, and the party discusses their route with the navigator, [Lyle Honeyhill](<../../../people/halflings/lyle-honeyhill.md>). Although the halflings offer a more hidden route along the coast, the party decides speed is of the essence. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) also talks with [Ewen Silversong](<../../../people/halflings/ewen-silversong.md>) a bit, hearing stories of his journeys across the [Sea of Storms](<../../../gazetteer/drankorian-hinterland/sea-of-storms.md>) to the mysterious lands to the south, and tales of storm giants lurking in the ocean there.

The next days pass quietly in the routine of the ship. While a few vessels are spotted – Chardonians and other traders – none come close or threaten to board. After a few days sailing, the [Emerald Song](<../../../things/ships/emerald-song.md>) approaches the [Old Chardon Canal](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/old-chardon-canal.md>) that connects the [Nevos Sea](<../../../gazetteer/nevos-and-apporia/nevos-sea.md>) to the [Endless Ocean](<../../../gazetteer/endless-ocean.md>) to the north, and cuts many weeks off the sailing time between [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) and [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>). Originally built by the Drankorians, it is now managed and run by the [Chardonian Empire](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>). 

Before arriving, [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) magically constructs a small lead box, for [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) to store the [Portable Hole](<../treasure/portable-hole.md>) in. Everyone but [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) climbs into the mirror; [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) then stores it in the [Portable Hole](<../treasure/portable-hole.md>), which he keeps in the lead box. So only [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) sees the scenes of the next day, the journey through the canal.

Before dawn, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) is awakened by an unnatural wind in the sails, and sees on deck an individual wearing sky blue robes with a deep hood shadowing their face. This person has constructed a circle of some powder, and is sitting in the middle of it chanting. As they chant, the powder in the circle floats to the sky and fills the sails. The morning passes this way, watching the landscape flow past, until the ship enters a deep canyon, completely smooth sided, and eventually passes into an open lake that seems to be filling a bowl of stone. Here, the person is the sky blue robes leaves, and another takes their place. With the light of midday, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) catches a brief glimpse of their eyes, which have no iris and are just a sky blue color. By the time the ship exits the canal, it is full dark, the stars emerging. 

During the next few days sail to [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) sends another message to [Marcella](<../../../people/chardonians/marcella.md>). She says, “I’m trapped in a cave. [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) thinks its kobolds, but I don’t know how long the deception can last. He thinks I was captured.” 

As the [Emerald Song](<../../../things/ships/emerald-song.md>) pulls into the [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) docks in the midafternoon, on the 13th day after departing [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>), the session ends.

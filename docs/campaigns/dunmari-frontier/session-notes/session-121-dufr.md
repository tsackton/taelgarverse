## Narrative 

Our session begins as the party soars over Emberwine on exotic griffins with peacock plumage—except for Wellby, who proudly guides his newly trained wyvern. Their fae companions Valeris (a truth-cursed satyr) and Ismara (a scholarly documentarian) travel alongside them as they journey east toward the Sunset Gate.

During their stay at Sunwine Hall, Delwath had defeated the duelist Arendelle and encountered Count Vashen, the Broken Mask—a former courtier who betrayed the Cloud Spinner until Kenzo's cleansing touch briefly restored his memories. Now they head toward Red Sun Watch, seeking Cloud Spinner's prison well.

Troubling news reaches Riswynn through her crow messenger: Chardon has fallen into chaos with riots led by the Eightfold Flame and a power vacuum left by absent magistrates. Meanwhile, she continues struggling to control the crown that had been used for mind control by generations of cleansed leaders.

Ismara explains that unlike the mundane world, the Feywild changes through the will of Archfey rather than cataclysm. She speaks of Fate's Ruin, transformed by the Rust Baron from artistic mountains into decay, and how Amberglow lost its color after Cloud Spinner's disappearance.

The party reaches the Sunset Gate—a massive, shimmering wall stretching endlessly upward. Parts reflect light brilliantly while others appear as crystal or frozen oil paint, constantly shifting and warm to the touch. Valeris and Ismara warn that time flows differently through the gate—those who pass might emerge years later.

As they fly northward along the gate, the landscape becomes increasingly bleached and desaturated—signs of Amberglow's corruption. Ismara, growing uneasy at the border of the dangerous Hollow Dark, bids them farewell to seek a Dreamwarden guide.

Their first challenge comes when four enormous humanoids demand "one vial of blood each" as toll. The party circles higher and continues their journey after Valeris confirms nothing good comes from giving fae creatures blood.

Later, they spot distant figures—three giant wolves carrying armed riders with dozens of smaller wolves running alongside them. When the wolf riders begin pursuing them, the party realizes they can't outrun these endurance hunters indefinitely and formulate a battle plan.

The battle unfolds dramatically: Wellby rains arrows from above, Delwath unleashes Ice Storms from a distance, Kenzo leaps from his griffin to engage the enemies directly, and Seeker uses telekinesis to fling a rider from its mount. The tide turns when one wolf unleashes a terrifying psychic howl that blasts through the minds of Kenzo, Delwath, and Riswynn. Kenzo is temporarily knocked unconscious, but Riswynn summons a pillar of celestial light that obliterates smaller wolves and heals her allies. Working together, the party eliminates their pursuers through strategic positioning, stunning strikes, and well-placed arrows.

After the battle, Seeker identifies the fallen enemies as duskhounds—lieutenants of Lord Umbriath, the Gloom Shaper whose territory has expanded since Cloud Spinner's disappearance. Seeker recalls that Lord Umbriath's servants had captured at least one amber light, potentially allowing them to track the Cloud Spinner.

As they continue northward, they spot a strange, unnaturally white river surrounded by dead trees. Beyond it lies their ultimate destination: Redsun Watch, a partially visible tower with tarnished golden decorations. Its upper third still catches sunlight while the rest has been swallowed by a massive tear in the Sunset Gate—a wall of pure darkness spreading across the horizon. Our session ends as the party halts to plan their approach.

## Detailed Outline

### Scene 1
- The party is flying over the rolling fields of Emberwine in the Feywild, accompanied by two fae companions: Valeris (a brutally honest satyr seeking redemption) and Ismara (a fae scholar from Gleamwater).
- They've recently left the Sunwine Hall, court of Lord Sovin, after spending approximately two days there after Delwath was defeated by duelist Arendelle, spending time telling stories in payment for his loss. 
- Wellby successfully trained a wyvern that had been trapped in a mirror for nearly a year and now rides it while the others fly on colorful griffins.
- Through Riswynn's crown, they learn of unrest in Chardon with riots led by the Eightfold Flame and conflicts with the Chelite trade.
- The party journeys eastward toward the Sunset Gate before planning to turn north to Red Sun Watch, where they hope to find clues about the Cloud Spinner's prison.
- During their travels, Seeker exchanges knowledge with Ismara about the differences between the Feywild and the mundane world.
- After several days, they reach the Sunset Gate, an enormous wall that divides light from darkness in the Feywild.
- Despite some curiosity about crossing through the gate, they decide to continue northward toward Red Sun Watch as originally planned.


### Scene 2
- The party travels north along the Sunset Gate through an uninhabited region of Emberwine, noticing the landscape becoming increasingly desaturated as they approach Amberglow.
- Ismara, concerned about the dangers ahead, bids farewell to the party and turns south to find a Dreamwarden who can guide her across Nocturne Vale.
- Flying over a line of low hills, the party encounters four enormous (15-20 foot tall) humanoids who demand a toll of "one vial of blood each" to pass.
- The party refuses to pay the blood toll and flies away, continuing their northward journey along the Sunset Gate.
- Seeker and the others discuss the nature of the Sunset Gate, learning it functions as a barrier between light and darkness rather than just a physical barrier for creatures.
- After several hours of flying, Wellby spots 2-3 small figures on mounts with a pack of something moving around them, heading in the party's direction.
- The party decides to investigate these approaching figures.


### Scene 3
- The party spots three giant wolves (15-20 feet long) with mounted riders and dozens of smaller wolves, likely a hunting party.
- As the party turns to get a better look, the wolf riders wheel toward them with weapons drawn.
- The party decides to flee initially, noticing they can slightly outpace the wolves but might eventually tire.

- Delwath casts Ice Storm with extended range, dealing significant damage to the lead wolf and rider while creating difficult terrain.
- Kenzo dramatically closes the distance by jumping from his griffin and using Raven's Whistle to swiftly move 270 feet, engaging one of the wolf riders directly on the ground.
- The wolf riders attack Kenzo, who deflects most of the damage but takes some hits from a shadowy horned rider wielding a greatsword.

- Wellby continues to fire arrows from above with deadly accuracy.
- One wolf rider teleports away after Riswynn's attack shatters its horn.
- As the battle turns against them, the remaining wolf flees but is struck down by Delwath's opportunity attack.

- The wolf rider teleports behind Kenzo to attack but fails to land significant blows.
- Seeker uses his damaged ladder to attack the stunned wolf while restraining another rider with telekinesis.
- The combined assault of the party overwhelms the remaining enemies, with Kenzo delivering the final series of strikes that finish off the last shadow rider.


### Scene 7

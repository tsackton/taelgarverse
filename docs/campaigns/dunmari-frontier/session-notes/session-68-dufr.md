## Narrative
We begin as the party meets again, all together after a long absence. Everyone returns from their adventures changed, more or less, and eager to be reunited. Over the campfire, the party tells their stories. 

![Lastlight Falls Dunmar Side](../../../assets/lastlight-falls-dunmar-side.png)

[Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) speaks of how he [found himself](<./session-53-dufr.md>) in the Deno’qai forests in the far north, a land once known as the [Forest of Dreams](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/forest-of-dreams.md>), but now called the [Forest of Nightmares](<../../../gazetteer/far-north/forest-of-nightmares.md>) as it was cursed during the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) against Cha’mutte. Traveling with the [Stoneborn](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/stoneborn/stoneborn.md>) paladin [Aristaea](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/aristaea.md>) Mountainhands, and the Deno’qai wildfire druid [Iascaire](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/iascaire.md>), Delwath sought to  [restore the lost tanshi](<./session-54-dufr.md>) trapped by Cha’mutte’s evil on  [the battlefields](<./session-55-dufr.md>) of the Great War.

[Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) speaks of her adventures, and apologizes for vanishing. After grabbing the [Chalice of the Runepriest](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/chalice-of-the-runepriest.md>), she found herself in [Heart of the Mountain](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>), the realm of the dwarven gods. Here, she met other [Dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) summoned to fulfill a debt to the Barahzel: [Thror](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/thror.md>) Redpeak, a storm sorcerer; [Rothfis](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/rothfis.md>) Stonefist, a bartender and monk;  and [Merash](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/merash.md>) Emberfoot, a smith and warrior. Together,  [they investigated](<./session-56-dufr.md>) the Shadowfell realm of Morkalan and  [uncovered](<./session-58-dufr.md>) the tragic story of the loss of the Chalice in the years after the Great War.

[Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) speaks of [his time](<./session-57-dufr.md>) in the jungles of the [Lizardfolk](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>), far to the east, in the [Lizardfolk](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) kingdom of [Orekatu](<../../../gazetteer/far-south/orekatu.md>). Here, he learned about the spiritual realms from the spirit guide [Elazar](<../../../people/lizardfolk/elazar.md>), who told him of a place, called the [Footprint of the Gods](<../../../gazetteer/far-south/azta-lekua.md>), where the borders between planes are thin. With the [Lizardfolk](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) druid Izarrak and their guide, [Enari](<../../../people/lizardfolk/enari.md>), [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) traveled [to the Footprint of the Gods](<./session-59-dufr.md>) to seek out whatever was disrupting the balance of the planes and allowing destructive elemental power to spill into Taelgar, and [restored harmony and balance](<./session-64-dufr.md>) by healing the wounded spirit creature Motua.

[Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) found himself on the [Wave Dancer](<../../../things/ships/wave-dancer.md>), a [halfling](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/halflings/halflings.md>) ship in the middle of [Green Sea](<../../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), [fleeing from hobgoblin pirates](<./session-60-dufr.md>). Eventually docking at the kenku port of [Wahacha](<../../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/wahacha.md>) in the [Vermillion Isles](<../../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/vermillion-isles.md>), part of the vast, magical chain of islands that separate [Green Sea](<../../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) from the ~Eastern Ocean~, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) met up with the wizard [Artem](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/artem-novolozek.md>) Novolozek, the kenku monster hunter [Rufus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/rufus.md>), the sea [Elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) warrior [Shoal](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/shoal.md>), and the human sailor and warrior [Alimash](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/alimash.md>) to  [seek out raiders](<./session-62-dufr.md>) who had been kidnapping people from ships in the area. After solving that mystery, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), [Alimash](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/alimash.md>), and [Shoal](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/shoal.md>) headed north to  [rescue the wizard](<./session-66-dufr.md>) [Arryn the Wanderer](<../../../people/other-humans/arryn.md>), who had vanished from his tower while experimenting with the magic of the Plane of Mirrors.

[Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) [found himself](<./session-61-dufr.md>) in the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), in the [domain of the Chanceweaver](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/fortune-s-rest.md>), the [Prince of Luck](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>). At the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>)’s court, he learned of a wild magic storm on the border of Fortune’s Rest and [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>), and travels with [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>), a fae monk of the Winter Knights of [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>); [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>) Hollytwist a fairy cleric of the light, also of [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>); and [Mikasa](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/mikasa.md>), a fae samurai to [calm the wild magic](<./session-63-dufr.md>). After doing so, [Mikasa](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/mikasa.md>) departs for her home, while [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>), [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>), and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) meet the human warrior [Caulaus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/caulaus.md>) Aportino who [guides them to the fey crossing](<./session-65-dufr.md>) at [Lastlight Falls](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/lastlight-falls.md>) in the ruined abandoned fey realm of Amberglow.

During the conversation, the party reads letters from [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) and elsewhere, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) reports on the information he has learned from scrying in [mid October](<../scrying-and-spying/scrying-delwath-oct-21.md>), [late October](<../scrying-and-spying/scrying-delwath-oct-26.md>), and [mid November](<../scrying-and-spying/scrying-delwath-nov-15.md>), and from a [week spent on the plains of Dunmar](<./interlude-delwath-postscript.md#dunmar-rumors>). The key facts include:

- [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) is on the bring of civil war: [Nayan Karnas](<../../../people/dunmari/nayan-karnas.md>) has seemingly not spoken to [Johar](<../../../people/dunmari/johar.md>); [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) is turning bloodthirsty under the sway of a cursed sword; and the Lakan monks have not done anything yet.
- [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) and company, now traveling with a subdued [Vola](<../../../people/chardonians/vola.md>) (whether due to mundane or magical coercion is not entirely clear), are crossing [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>).
- [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) is preparing to march east, and soon, with a large army of [Orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) and undead, presumably to recover the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) which was, according to [Govir](<../../../people/dunmari/govir.md>)'s research, lost in a fortification of the [Aagir Mystai](<../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/aagir-mystai.md>) to the east during the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). 
- A man in [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>) named [Radomir](<../../../people/other-humans/radomir.md>) found a [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../treasure/notable-items/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>), and it is now apparently in the possession of someone or something called Rodnya Voknaz.

The party decides to first try to restore [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>), and then likely head east to attempt to beat [Grash](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) to the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>).

We end late at night, as the party prepares to look in the mirror and then sleep.

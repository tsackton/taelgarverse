## Narrative

### Part 1: The Jade and the Cloudspinner

We begin in the morning, as the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) awakes from their rest after their return from Apollyon's Tower, and considers their next move against [Ra'ghemdros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/ra-ghemdros.md>). The morning begins with a brief, unproductive discussion with the hobgoblin wizard [Revaka](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/revaka.md>), trapped in the [Mirror of Soul Trapping](<../treasure/notable-items/mirror-of-soul-trapping.md>) by [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) and who the party hoped might be a useful ally against his daughter, [Ra'ghemdros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/ra-ghemdros.md>). With the hobgoblin a dead end, the party discussed other possible approaches to deal with [Ra'ghemdros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/ra-ghemdros.md>): how could they lure her from her lair, and could they even defeat her in her domain, if they could not lure her forth? Eventually, a plan was formed: [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) would offer to trade treasure from Apollyon's Tower for the jade, and use Ghesh as an intermediary to arrange a meeting, pretending his teleportation magic would not survive an extraplanar journey to lure her out of her lair. 

Taking to the skies in the forms of swift birds, the party traveled westward, their destination set: a meeting with Ghesh. Upon their arrival, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) spoke with Ghesh, hinting at a treasure, something [Ra'ghemdros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/ra-ghemdros.md>) would desire. Ghesh, intrigued, agreed to help, and soon three dragonets were escorting the party to the heart of the black dragon’s territory. They flew with purpose, Kenzo jogging below while the rest traveled in disguise.

The party reached the ruins of the villa where Ra'ghemdros made her lair by early afternoon. Above them, Ra'ghemdros perched, her presence imposing. Her black scales were interrupted only by the scar that shimmered in deep red hues. After a brief and obsequious conversation with Kenzo, she agreed to the trade, and [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) offered to return in two hours with Apollyon's Throne. 

>[!quote]+ Ra'ghemdros' Negotiation
>
>Ra'ghemdros begins by introducing herself: "I am Ra'ghemdros, daughter of Cha'mutte, I am the Light Stealer and the Final Shadow, the Devourer of Drankor, the Last Empress of Hkar, known as the Eternal Night and Enslaver of the Secret Sunset."
>
>Kenzo bows deeply and addresses her respectfully: "The Final Shadow. It is an honor to be in your presence and to have this audience."
>
>Ra'ghemdros acknowledges them and listens to Kenzo's claim of having traveled to the western tower, her interest piqued. "Do you know of this place, the tower to the west?" Kenzo asks, to which she replies, "Of course. I know of everything in my domain."
>
>Ra'ghemdros expresses interest in what lies within the tower: "I would dearly love his throne, and I would be willing to trade. What is this you wish? The smallest trinket, a piece of jade?" Kenzo queries, "If I bring you his throne, you'd be willing to make that trade?" "Yes, I would", Ra'ghemdros replies. 
>
>When asked if they could obtain safe passage, Ra'ghemdros agrees but warns, "As soon as you take the jade, you must leave immediately. You will be no longer welcome. I would not have you lingering in my domain--I would not wish to draw Apollyon's Eye."
>
>Ra'ghemdros also warns of Apollyon's looming threat, stating, "All prisons fail..." while glancing at the nearby villa, which seems to be always at the forefront of her attention. 

With two hours to spare, the party set out to explore the villa that Ra'ghemdros had been eyeing, and where the fiend Kenzo sensed seemed to be.  [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) sent a rat to scout, uncovering a cellar guarded by floating acid columns, and in the cellar a room filled with statues and magical flames, until the rat was burned to a crisp by a fire trap. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) then used clairvoyance, discovering a crypt with urns and a symbol of a flaming red eye surrounded by shadows—signs of Cha'mutte’s influence. 

Returning to Ra'ghemdros, the party presented the throne, with Kenzo reciting [Ra'ghemdros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/ra-ghemdros.md>)' many titles as they handed over the prize and accepted the jade in return. The dragon took the throne, her satisfaction evident as she ordered her servants to spread the word of her newfound power. They left swiftly, Ra'ghemdros’ triumphant roar echoing behind them as she vanished into her lair.

Sneakily and quickly, the party did not depart, but instead entered the villa with a carefully planned teleportation spell, immediately finding themselves in the heart of danger. Delwath's Ghostly Gaze revealed a hidden chamber with a formidable fiend on guard. Without delay, they teleported directly into the room, preparing for what would become a fierce battle against the demonic creature of flame and shadow. 

In the ensuing battle, the fiend unleashed its fury with a flaming whip and devastating blows, pulling Delwath into the searing lava. Despite this, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s resolve never wavered. He delivered powerful strikes imbued with radiant energy, each critical hit pushing the fiend closer to its demise. Kenzo's martial prowess shone as he struck with psychic power, while Seeker’s constructs—including the ever-present heroic animated [ladder](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/companions/ladder.md>)—provided vital support. [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) soared above, blinding the fiend and giving his allies the edge they needed.

The climactic moment came when [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) saved [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) from the burning Wall of Fire, allowing Delwath to summon every ounce of strength for a final radiant strike that vanquished the fiend. The party emerged victorious, with the fiend dissipating into nothingness and the chamber falling silent.

After the battle, the party discovered a mysterious key and remnants of the Concordia Pyrae, including valuable tomes chronicling the history of the villa and its tragic downfall. Seeker’s tremor sense revealed something hidden beneath the lava pool, prompting a creative plan to clear the lava and uncover a portal. Using a key found on the fiend, Delwath unlocked the gateway, leading the party to a shadowy prison.

Within the shadowy chamber, they found a suspended crystal containing the enigmatic entity known as [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>). After a harrowing struggle to sever the shadowy bonds, they freed the crystal, deciding to take it with them. The party then teleported to Dimitar’s tower, seeking rest and refuge from an impending threat. With the dragon Ra'ghemdros potentially on their trail, they found temporary sanctuary in the tunnels beneath the temple, gathering strength and strategizing for the inevitable confrontation that lay ahead.

### Part 2: The Battle Against Ra'ghemdros

The party gathered at Dimitar's tower, weary but resolute, knowing the upcoming confrontation with [Ra'ghemdros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/ra-ghemdros.md>) would test their strength and unity like never before. As they rested, they shared a [vision](<../dreams-and-visions/the-last-jade-vision.md>)—a vision of [Rai](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>), the ancient battle with Apollyon, and the eerie bindings that still held sway over the realm.

With the alarm spell triggered, the party scrambled to confront a pair of dragonets, learning that they were sent to keep search for the party and report back. Letting them go, the party worked to prepare for the inevitable fight. Seeker repaired the damaged lighthouse crystal, preparing to use it as a beacon in the battle to come. Tilly Brineheart and [Milo Thistlefoot](<../../../people/halflings/milo-thistlefoot.md>) -- having been warned by the party to flee the dragon -- instead arrived to help in the battle, reporting that Ra'ghemdros and her forces were approaching—chimeras and dragonets advancing rapidly.

The battle with the dragon's minions was fierce, a relentless storm of claws and elemental power. Seeker's Rune of Psychic Disruption and Tilly's Ice Storm weakened their enemies, while [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), enlarged by magic, waited to engage directly. Together, the party fought valiantly, gradually thinning their foes, but the real test awaited them.

[Ra'ghemdros](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/ra-ghemdros.md>) descended with the force of a nightmare—its breath a deadly mix of darkness and acid that swept through the battlefield. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) and Kenzo faced the dragon directly, while [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) kept their distance, delivering attacks from afar. The ancient beast used every advantage it had—legendary resistances, turning incorporeal, and terrifying presence that threatened to break their resolve.

But the party held their ground. Seeker's constructs kept the dragon distracted, and Kenzo's unrelenting attacks wore it down. Delwath cast spells to bolster defenses, and Tilly provided crucial healing, keeping them all in the fight. They fought strategically, spreading out to avoid being overwhelmed by Ra'ghemdros' devastating breath attacks.

As Ra'ghemdros grew weaker, Dimitar seized the opportunity, launching a powerful fireball that shook the battlefield. With one final push, Kenzo leaped onto the dragon's back, delivering a series of crushing blows. Ra'ghemdros let out a final, defiant roar before collapsing, its massive body crashing to the earth—a symbol of the party's hard-won victory.

As the dragon fell, the horizon was painted in vivid colors, and suddenly, the sun began to rise, casting an entire 360-degree circle of radiant sunset around the battlefield. It was a moment of profound beauty amidst the chaos, signaling the end of a fierce confrontation and the dawn of a new hope for the party.

In the aftermath, the party stood victorious but battered. They knew this was not the end, but a significant milestone in their journey. The shadow of [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) and the remnants of Rai's vision still loomed, but for now, they had defeated an ancient terror and reclaimed a glimmer of hope in the face of darkness.

As the dust settled after the fierce battle with Ra'ghemdros, the party took a moment to look around and witness the scene unfolding in the distance. About three miles away, two groups of dragonettes clashed—a larger force overwhelming a smaller one. The echoes of the battle were still fresh when Dimitar, with his powerful voice amplified by magic, declared across the landscape: "The dragon is dead. Meet at the villa for your rewards."

Dimitar, now stepping into a leadership role, assumed the title "Protector of the Forever Sunset." With an air of authority, he gathered the dragonettes and began organizing their next steps. The party, weary from their victory, made their way cautiously to the lair of Ra'ghemdros. They navigated around geysers of acid and shadowy tendrils, eventually reaching the heart of the hoard.

What they found took their breath away. Ra'ghemdros' treasure hoard was not a typical dragon's pile of riches; it was a carefully curated museum of wealth. Coins were stacked meticulously, jewelry was arranged by type and color, and walls were adorned with holy symbols, lockets, and brooches. One section had over four hundred earrings, displayed like an elaborate collection. The organized beauty of the lair spoke of Ra'ghemdros' meticulous nature.

The party moved deeper, dispelling the acid waterfall that separated the main chamber from a hidden one. Beyond it lay even greater wonders: rare artifacts from the ancient Drankorian Empire, a coronation crown, intricately carved statuettes, and a collection of magical items. Among them, a necklace with seven rubies, a shortbow humming with energy, and a small figurine of a triceratops caught their attention.

After careful deliberation, the group filled their portable hole with the most valuable items they could carry—gems, historical artifacts, and magical items. They left [Dimitaur](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/companions/dimitaur.md>) to guard and dispense the rest to the dragonets of the island, installing a magical eye on his throne to keep watch and communicate. 

The session ends as the party sails back through the storm with Milo and Tilly, and arrives at [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). 

## Detailed Summary

### Bargaining with the Hobgoblin in the Mirror

- Ultimately, the group decides against releasing her, fearing she could become a greater threat.


### Planning the Dragon Ambush
The party strategizes on how to deal with a powerful dragon, debating whether to lure her out of her lair or face her directly inside.
- The group considers using rumors or indirect messages to draw the dragon out of her lair, hoping to avoid a confrontation in her heavily fortified territory.
- They weigh the risks of fighting the dragon outside versus inside her lair, and whether they should negotiate for the jade or prepare for a direct fight.
- Ultimately, the party decides to prepare for both negotiation and combat, using stealth and misdirection to their advantage.


### Journey to the Dragon's Lair
The party sets their plan into motion, transforming into animals and traveling to meet Ghesh in hopes of securing an audience with the dragon Ra'ghemdros.
- The group transforms into fast-flying birds to approach Ghesh, using the disguise to maintain secrecy and build rapport with him.
- Kenzo convinces Ghesh to help arrange a meeting with Ra'ghemdros, hinting that he has discovered something important in the western region that the dragon would want to know about, potentially involving treasure that could be rescued for Ra'ghemdros. 
- Ghesh agrees to send a message to Ra'ghemdros, and three dragonettes are assigned to escort the party to the dragon's lair. Kenzo jogs alongside the dragonettes, while the rest of the party travels in animal form.


### Audience with Ra'ghemdros
The party meets Ra'ghemdros, the powerful black dragon, in her lair amidst the ruins of an ancient villa of a lost Drankorian scholarly or magical society.
- The party arrives at the thermal bath complex, where Ra'ghemdros is perched above, her massive pitch-black form marred by a scar shimmering in reds and oranges.
- Ra'ghemdros begins by introducing herself: "I am Ra'ghemdros, daughter of Cha'mutte, I am the Light Stealer and the Final Shadow, the Devourer of Drankor, the Last Empress of Hkar, known as the Eternal Night and Enslaver of the Secret Sunset."
- Kenzo bows deeply and addresses her respectfully: "The Final Shadow. It is an honor to be in your presence and to have this audience."
- Ra'ghemdros acknowledges them and listens to Kenzo's claim of having traveled to the western tower, her interest piqued. "Do you know of this place, the tower to the west?" Kenzo asks, to which she replies, "Of course. I know of everything in my domain."
- Ra'ghemdros expresses interest in what lies within the tower: "I would dearly love his throne, and I would be willing to trade. What is this you wish? The smallest trinket, a piece of jade?" Kenzo queries, "If I bring you his throne, you'd be willing to make that trade?" "Yes, I would", Ra'ghemdros replies. 
- When asked if they could obtain safe passage, Ra'ghemdros agrees but warns, "As soon as you take the jade, you must leave immediately. You will be no longer welcome. I would not have you lingering in my domain--I would not wish to draw Apollyon's Eye."
- Ra'ghemdros also warns of Apollyon's looming threat, stating, "All prisons fail..." while glancing at the nearby villa, which seems to be always at the forefront of her attention. 
- The party discusses the logistics of retrieving the throne, weighing the use of magic or stealth to avoid detection and minimize conflict.
- The group agrees that while Ra'ghemdros might seem cooperative, they must remain cautious and consider backup plans in case the negotiation fails or a trap is sprung.
- She departs to her lair, after agreeing to meet the party back in 2 hours and granting them safe passage in the meantime. 


### Scouting the Villa and Returning to Ra'ghemdros
With two hours until their next meeting with Ra'ghemdros, the party decides to explore the nearby villa to gather more information.
- They send a rat ahead to explore the ruins, discovering a cellar guarded by floating columns of acid and a large room with magical flames and statues depicting elegantly dressed individuals.
- They use clairvoyance to investigate further, discovering a crypt lined with urns and a wall bearing a symbol of a flaming red eye surrounded by shadows.
- The party discusses their findings, theorizing that the villa may contain hidden dangers or clues related to Cha'mutte and his connection to Ra'ghemdros.
- After completing their scouting, the group returns to Ra'ghemdros with the throne, which they had retrieved earlier from the western tower.
- Kenzo addresses Ra'ghemdros: "Ra'ghemdros Light Stealer, Final Shadow, Devourer of Drakor, the Last Empress of Hkar, and the Eternal Night, we bring to you your new throne."
- Ra'ghemdros takes the throne with clear satisfaction, declaring, "My servants, go forth and let it be known your Empress has a new throne."
- She rewards the party with the jade as promised, emphasizing that they must leave immediately, and dives back into her lair, holding the throne aloft for all to see.


### Confronting the Fiend in the Lava Chamber
The party teleports into a dangerous intersection, preparing for a confrontation with a fiend in a lava-filled chamber.
- After entering the villa using Dimension Door, the party appeared in a four-way intersection of the dungeon.
- Delwath uses Ghostly Gaze to scout the room, revealing a hidden room in which a large fiend stands near a lava fountain, apparently on guard.
- The party discusses positioning and tactics to avoid line effects from the fiend, identifying the threat as a balrog-like creature holding a whip and cloaked in shadow. They decide to use Scatter to teleport into the room, hoping to avoid Cha'mutte's eye and enter the lava chamber without needing to find the secret door.


### Battle Against the Fiend
The party engages in a fierce battle with a powerful fiend in the lava chamber, utilizing a mix of spells, attacks, and creative tactics.
- Seeker attempts to destroy a massive scrying mirror that connects to Ra'ghemdros's lair but finds it too resilient to break easily. The mirror allows Ra'ghemdros to spy on them, and the party debates whether to destroy it or focus on the fiend.
- The fiend, a balrog-like creature, retaliates with its fiery whip and multiple devastating attacks, focusing its ire on Delwath and his radiant sword.
- Delwath delivers powerful strikes with his magical sword, which glows with radiant energy, preventing the fiend from regenerating its wounds. He uses smites to enhance his attacks, each strike unleashing bursts of radiant power that weaken the fiend, often scoring critical hits with his sword that seems eager to destroy the fiend. At one point, Delwath is pulled into the lava by the fiend's whip, but he manages to escape, continuing to fight despite his injuries. One particularly notable critical hit caused Delwath's sword to glow with an intense light, accompanied by a whispered Elvish chant, as the fiend recoiled in pain.
- Kenzo uses his martial prowess and the Fist of Planar Power to deal significant damage, including psychic attacks that bypass the fiend's resistances. He also uses Stunning Strike in an attempt to hinder the fiend, forcing it to use its legendary resistances to avoid being incapacitated.
- The fiend demonstrates its formidable power, using legendary actions to strike at Delwath and others, targeting the party members with its whip and claw attacks. Despite the intense heat and damage, Delwath manages to stay in the fight, aided by healing spells from his allies.
- Seeker summons a Clay Construct Spirit, which, along with the animated ladder, aids in attacking the fiend and diverting its attention. The construct and ladder both manage to land several hits, providing crucial support during the battle. The ladder even managed a critical hit, dealing significant force damage to the fiend, which momentarily disrupted its focus.
- Wellby takes to the air, using his ranged attacks to target the fiend from above. He successfully blinds the fiend at one point, giving the party a temporary advantage and reducing the threat of its devastating attacks. Wellby also uses his position to support his allies, ensuring they can focus on dealing damage.
- The fiend casts a Wall of Fire, attempting to separate the party and trap several members within its flames. The fire proves a constant threat, forcing the party to adapt their positioning throughout the fight.
- The battle reaches a turning point when Kenzo uses Step of the Wind to rescue Delwath from the Wall of Fire, preventing further damage. Delwath, barely standing, channels all his remaining strength into a final series of attacks, delivering a devastating radiant strike that ultimately vanquishes the fiend. The fiend's form dissipates, and the Wall of Fire disappears as its hold over the battlefield is broken.


### Aftermath in the Lava Chamber
With the fiend defeated, the party takes stock of their situation and the room.
- The fiend's body collapses, leaving behind only a large black iron key. The party recognizes it as similar to an item they found long ago, tied to Shemut's Holy Symbol.
- Seeker shakes hands with the Clay Construct before it reverts to a lump of clay, its purpose fulfilled. The ladder, excited to be useful and to finally have a chance to destroy a mirror, instead of protecting them, proceeds to smash the scrying mirror, shattering it into pieces.
- Delwath, battered and burned, casts Prayer of Healing to help the party recover. They take a short rest, replenishing their resources and discussing their next steps.
- The party investigates the room further. They discover ten books on a shelf that have survived numerous scorch marks. These books bear the symbol of an open book with a flame and stars, marking them as part of the Concordia Pyrae—a secret Drankorian society dedicated to understanding the magic of the Plane of Fire.
- The books contain extensive research into the magic of the Plane of Fire, including transmutation magic and fire manipulation. Three of the books are a chronicle of events, detailing the history of the villa. These records indicate that the villa was once a major pilgrimage site in Drankor, and later a place where many wizards conducted research. The chronicles also describe the downfall of the island, including a war between Apollyon and Cha'mutte over possession of a prisoner, with the last entries warning of the island's imminent destruction. 
- Using tremor sense, Seeker detects something vibrating beneath the lava pool. The party debates how to proceed, eventually deciding to try and remove the lava to uncover whatever lies beneath.
- They devise a plan using performance of creation to create adamantine shovels, which the ladder and clay construct use to begin shoveling lava. Realizing this will take too long, they decide to use Wall of Stone to displace the lava, creating a cofferdam to reduce the volume they need to clear.
- Once the lava is partially displaced, Seeker uses Ghostly Gaze to look beneath and finds a portal at the bottom of the lava pool. The key found from the fiend seems to fit, and Delwath uses it to unlock the portal, revealing a shimmering darkness below—the gateway to their next challenge.


### Shadow Prison and the Rescue of Cloud Spinner
The party passes through the portal into a small shadowy chamber, discovering a powerful artifact and a prisoner.
- The chamber is a 20-foot square room with walls made of constantly shifting shadows. Four ropes of shadow hang from the corners, suspending a pale gray smoky crystal in the center of the room.
- Through the crystal, they dimly see a woman with long hair, colored in brilliant reds and oranges, who seems to be in a suspended state, her chest rising and falling slowly.
- Delwath attempts to cut the ropes of shadow holding the crystal, managing to partially sever them. The shadows retaliate, inflicting levels of exhaustion on the party members as they continue their efforts to break the bonds.
- Kenzo and Delwath take turns attacking the shadow ropes, each time risking exhaustion as the shadows drain their strength and vitality. Despite the risks, they manage to sever all four ropes, releasing the crystal.
- Once freed, the crystal remains floating in mid-air, heavy but unaffected by gravity. The party realizes they need to move the crystal out of the shadowy prison.
- Seeker calls upon the animated ladder, which wraps itself around the crystal and slowly drags it out of the portal, back into the lava chamber. The ladder, immune to exhaustion, successfully transports the crystal to safety.
- The party inspects the crystal closely and determines that it contains a powerful entity, known as Cloud Spinner. Unsure of how to release her, they decide to store the crystal in the portable hole for now, planning to deal with it later.
- With the crystal secured, the party debates their next move, ultimately deciding to teleport to Dimitar's tower to rest and recover, hoping to avoid any immediate retaliation from the dragon Ra'ghemdros.


### Arrival at Dimitar's Tower and New Challenges
After defeating the fiend and rescuing Cloud Spinner, the party teleports to Dimitar's temple to rest.
- Upon arrival at the temple, the party is greeted by Dimitar, who steps out from behind a statue, initially defensive but calms once he recognizes the group.
- The party informs Dimitar of their recent encounters, including breaking a century-old curse and the potential threat posed by an angered dragon, Ra'ghemdros.
- They reveal the last piece of jade and mention the crystal containing Cloud Spinner, an ancient archfey imprisoned for millennia.
- Dimitar expresses concern about the threat Ra'ghemdros poses, as the dragon may now scry the entire island to locate them.
- The party debates their next steps, with Dimitar suggesting they rest in the tunnels beneath the temple for safety from any potential retaliation from Ra'ghemdros.
- The group decides to take Dimitar's advice, moving into the narrow tunnels to set up a watch and ensure they can rest without interference.
- During the rest, they continue discussing their next move, strategizing about how to confront Ra'ghemdros and use the resources they have, including potentially creating a simulacrum of Delwath for added strength during the upcoming confrontation.
- The scene closes with the party settling into the tunnels, preparing for whatever challenges lie ahead, knowing that Ra'ghemdros may be coming for them sooner rather than later.


### Preparing for the Dragon's Attack
The party deals with an alarm spell going off during their rest and interrogates a pair of dragonettes to gather information, while strategizing for an upcoming confrontation with Ra'ghemdros.
- The party takes time to rest and reflect at Dimitar's tower, preparing themselves for what lies ahead, and experiencing the [The Last Jade Vision](<../dreams-and-visions/the-last-jade-vision.md>).
- An alarm spell is triggered, alerting the party to an intruder during their rest.
- The party climbs out of the tunnels and encounters two dragonettes keeping watch.
- Delwath casts Tongues to interrogate the dragonettes, learning they are on the island to keep watch and report back.
- The party decides to send the dragonettes back with a message for Ra'ghemdros, positioning themselves strategically.
- Tilly and Milo, previously separated from the party, rejoin them with news of Ra'ghemdros and a group of dragonettes and chimeras approaching.
- The party sends a message to Gashen and Megan, trying to convince them to help in the fight against Ra'ghemdros.
- They strategize to recruit more dragonettes by promising rewards from the dragon's hoard.


### Climbing the Tower and Preparing for Battle
The party decides to climb up to the tower to investigate and prepare the lighthouse mechanism to aid in their upcoming battle with Ra'ghemdros.
- The group climbs up to the top of the tower to inspect the lighthouse mechanism, hoping to use it as a beacon during their fight.
- They discover that the crystal at the center of the lighthouse is damaged, with two facets broken and one misaligned.
- Seeker manages to use Mending on the misaligned piece, and uses Performance of Creation to replace missing crystal chunks.
- The lighthouse is partially repaired, but the light will only reach a few hundred feet, perhaps a little more, perhaps a little less. The light is intended to give them early warning of the dragon's approach.
- The party strategizes, deciding to use the light to get a few moment's notice before Ra'ghemdros is within striking distance, allowing them to cast spells and prepare defenses.
- They discuss their tactics, including splitting into a hiding group and an attacking group, with Seeker, Wellby, and Milo staying in cover while Delwath and Kenzo prepare for direct confrontation.
- The party distributes potions and gear, including a Potion of Heroism for Kenzo, who will act as the primary attacker against Ra'ghemdros.


### Battle with Minions Before the Dragon Arrives
The party faces off against a wave of enemies—chimeras and dragonettes—before Ra'ghemdros makes its appearance.
- Four chimeras and thirteen dragonettes approach, moving quickly towards the party's position.
- The party positions themselves, using the lighthouse as a beacon, and distributes potions to prepare for the oncoming attack.
- Seeker uses a Rune of Psychic Disruption to incapacitate one chimera, causing it to fall from the sky and take heavy damage.
- Tilly casts Ice Storm to damage multiple chimeras and dragonettes, weakening their approach.
- Wellby and Milo use their ranged attacks to target the chimeras, inflicting significant damage, while Kenzo prepares to engage in melee once they are closer.
- The minions move closer each round, with the party coordinating their attacks to thin their numbers before the final confrontation with Ra'ghemdros.


### Battle with Ra'ghemdros
The party engages in an intense and chaotic battle with Ra'ghemdros, an ancient dragon determined to reclaim its territory.
- Ra'ghemdros begins the fight by turning visible and unleashing a breath weapon—a mixture of darkness and acid—hitting multiple party members, dealing significant damage to Delwath and Milo and destroying some constructs.
- Delwath and Kenzo move into close range, while Seeker and Wellby use ranged attacks, trying to keep some distance.
- The dragon shows its powerful breath weapon again, dealing a mix of necrotic and acid damage, forcing many saving throws. Milo's evasion helps him mitigate much of the damage, but others aren't as lucky.
- Seeker summons a stone construct to attack the dragon directly, managing to keep it occupied while taking some hits. Kenzo, in his enlarged form, delivers a series of powerful blows.
- The party takes turns positioning themselves strategically, staying spread out to avoid grouping targets for Ra'ghemdros' attacks.
- Tilly supports with healing spells and Ice Storms, while Delwath uses his magic to bolster the group's defenses.
- The dragon uses legendary actions, including turning incorporeal to gain resistance to all damage, making it hard for the party to deal consistent harm.
- In response, the party focuses on wearing the dragon down through strategic use of spells and sheer persistence, gradually reducing its hit points.
- Milo and Wellby focus on delivering precision strikes, targeting weak points, while Kenzo continues to deal significant melee damage, often leaping onto the dragon's back to attack.
- After an intense battle, with multiple party members getting injured, Ra'ghemdros' health falls critically low, and Dimitar seizes the opportunity, casting a powerful 7th-level fireball, dealing a significant amount of damage.
- Kenzo finishes the fight with a series of devastating strikes, bringing Ra'ghemdros down. The dragon collapses, its massive form crashing into the ground, ending the battle.


### Ra'ghemdros' Hoard and Dimitaur's Rule
- The party witnesses an ongoing battle between dragonettes, with Dimitar using his booming voice to announce the death of Ra'ghemdros.
- Dimitar proclaims himself the leader of Fakar and takes on a new title, the "Protector of the Forever Sunset."
- The party makes their way to the lair of Ra'ghemdros, carefully avoiding traps like acid geysers and shadowy tendrils.
- The treasure hoard is revealed, organized meticulously like a museum, with countless items of jewelry, coins, and historical artifacts.
- The acid waterfall guarding part of the treasure is dispelled, revealing a separate chamber with more valuable and magical items.
- The party selects the most valuable treasures they can carry, including magic items and historical artifacts, while leaving Dimitar in charge of the hoard.
- They install a magical eye in Dimitar's throne to maintain surveillance of the treasure and then make their way back to the villa.

## Bastion Information

The map room and the hall of stories can each give you three true facts about something. This can be a legend, any kind of creature, or a famous object for the Hall of Stories; or a legend, a known event or location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object for the Map Room. You have time to use each room 2-3 times during the journey and Tollen downtime. 
### Map Room (Ursk)

- [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>) is ruled by a council of powerful wizards, the heads of the eight rodnye
- The rodnye (singular: rodnya) are loose confederations of people, mostly magic-users but not exclusively, bound together by some kind of mysterious ritual
- Emigration is tightly controlled in Ursk, and the few people who do leave tend to be sickly and weak
### Map Room (Land between Ursk and Vostok)

- This is a land of boreal forests, swift rivers, and rocky coasts, with few people, a dangerous place, where dragon attacks are common
- Halfling memories do speak of a people who live in the forests, scattered groups related to the people of Vostok and the Sembaran Highlands, who worship animal spirits
- Rumors claim that once, before the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the giants of the [Sivnjo Mountains](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/sivnjo-mountains.md>) (SHEEF-nyo; meta: the mountains forming the eastern border of Vostok - name might change) provided sanctuary and protection to many people - human, stoneborn, dwarf, and others - against the dangers of the north, but recent tales do not tell what has become of this protection
### Hall of Stories (Rodnya Voknaz)

Few, vague, and cryptic are the tales of the Rodnya, but here is what you are able to gather

- Pragmatism, not dogmatism, is the way of the Voknaz
- The Rodnya Voknaz is among the weakest and least influential of the Rodnye
- This does not mean the Rodnya Voknaz are weak: it is said the head of Voknaz can permanently turn boulders into young dragons with magic.

## Other Information

- A message from [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) to [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), via the Sending spell, received on Feb 25th: “[Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) sends his regards, and asks: what's the matter, Delwath, don't you want to see the rest of my little surprise? Scared to watch?”
- Information recovered from the [Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) Archives, by the painstaking work of Nuzkar, cross-referenced to books available in Tollen and now acquired for the Vindristjarna Archives, provides a [chronicle of Dunmari history](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md#history>) in the days before the Great War, detailing the [first dynasty of Dunmari Samraats](<../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/aatmaji-dynasty.md>), which ended with a disastrous expedition to destroy the lingering evil in Drankor led by Samraat Aatmaji [Dasa](<../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/dasa.md>), who died in the attempt. While most of this is fragmentary, [Nuzkar](<../../../people/orcs/nuzkar.md>) is able to reconstruct two notes:
	- [Report of the Aagiri to Samraat Dasa](<../letters-and-notes/report-of-the-aagiri-to-samraat-dasa.md>)
	- [An Annotated (Partial) Map of Drankor](<../letters-and-notes/an-annotated-partial-map-of-drankor.md>)

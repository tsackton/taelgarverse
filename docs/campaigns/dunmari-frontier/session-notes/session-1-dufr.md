# Session 1



**(Friday May 29, 2020; in Taelgar, morning March 22 to evening March 22)**

[Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) of Highkeep, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) Goodbarrel, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) the [Elves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) all meet as they rush in to save the villagers of [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) from two rampaging giant hyenas. They defeat the hyenas (one killed by [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), with staff and bare hands, and the other attacked with magical flames by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), distracted by an illusory baby antelope and tripped into a hole in the ground by [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), then stabbed by [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>)), managing to keep all the villagers alive; one of the villages, a woman with a touch of divine magic named [Beli](<../../../people/dunmari/beli.md>), helps in the battle. Afterward, they talk in the tea room below [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s house, while the server [Badya](<../../../people/dunmari/badya.md>) helps tend the wounded. Speaker [Candrosa](<../../../people/dunmari/candrosa.md>), the leader of the [Shakun Mystai](<../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/shakun-mystai.md>), and Elder [Kisa](<../../../people/dunmari/kisa.md>), leader of [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), arrive and discuss the attacks -- these are the latest and most dangerous in a string of mysterious attacks. [Kisa](<../../../people/dunmari/kisa.md>) asks [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) to investigate the problem, and he gets everyone else to help.

Investigating the beasts, they seemed to have fought other battles before arriving in the village. Some skillful tracking from [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) allowed the party to pick up the trail of the beasts, leading a bit north of due east, into the desert.

After about half a day of travel, the terrain gradually became rockier, eventually leading you to an area of small box canyons and rocky terrain, where you lost the trail of the beasts. As [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) and [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) talked, and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) pondered geology, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) realized that, in this twisting terrain, he was starting to be unsure of which direction was which and even where [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) lay. Climbing via grappling hook to a high point, he looked around, seeing nothing stirring across the canyonlands, which extended for miles to the east towards a large, distant canyon. To the north, a cloud of dust pointed towards something moving along the old trade road.

On the road, the party ran into [Alesh](<../../../people/dunmari/alesh.md>), a Dunmari scout returning from the [Gomat](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/gomat.md>) oasis, where she had spent the night with [Akan](<../../../people/dunmari/akan.md>) and his family, who were grazing their herds in the area. They discussed the attacks on the town, and [Alesh](<../../../people/dunmari/alesh.md>) talked about how in her childhood people were scared, but for the past decade the [Nashtkar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>), the blasted plains, had seemed, if not safe, at least less of a constant threat to [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). But perhaps that was changing. She rode on for the grazing lands north of [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>).

The party pushed on towards the [Gomat](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/gomat.md>) oasis, traveling hard and long, into the night as they pushed through the desert heat and into the night to get to [Gomat](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/gomat.md>) as quickly as possible. Exhausted from the long, hard day of travel, they arrive at the oasis, only to see tents, yes, but also three enormous lizards, 10 feet long and scaly, ripping into dead sheep scattered across the ground.

## Narrative
We begin at a campsite by the River [Ket](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ket.md>), where [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) are gathered around the warmth of a flickering campfire, reminiscing about the past few weeks in the [Vargaldi](<../../../groups/vargaldi.md>) camp and journeying along the Ket. The topic of discussion soon shifted towards the looming challenge: entering the trade city of [Zvervinka](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/zvervinka.md>) without drawing undue attention. The discussion took a strategic turn as they considered [Zvervinka](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/zvervinka.md>)’s strict stance on magic. [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>)’s unique societal structure, dominated by the magical guilds known as [Rodnya](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya.md>) and enforced by the vigilant [Watchers](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/eyes-of-vedmakov.md>), demanded careful navigation. The night ended with the party deciding to adopt the guise of monster hunters, leveraging the exotic parts of an ice worm and a dragon they had collected. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) and [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) would act as local Vargaldi guides to lend credibility to their cover. 

The next morning, the party approached [Zvervinka](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/zvervinka.md>)’s gates, disguises in place. Here, they encountered the city guards, wary of newcomers and questioning the unusual composition of their group, demanding to know their purpose in [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>). [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), with a masterful display of the local dialect, introduced them as monster hunters bearing valuable dragon parts for trade.

The guards’ skepticism waned as the party unveiled their haul. [Fyodar](<../../../people/other-humans/fyodar.md>), one of the guards, taken with [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>)'s guide persona and encouraged with the gift of a dragon tooth, shared some local information. He mentioned two people worth knowing: [Roman](<../../../people/other-humans/roman.md>), the well-connected proprietor of a fancy merchant tavern, the Silver Wolf; and [Lena Sorokina](<../../../people/other-humans/lena-sorokina.md>), a [Watchers](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/eyes-of-vedmakov.md>) known for her contacts among the [Rodnya](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya.md>) who might be able to secure a monster hunting contract. 

As the party navigated the bureaucratic formalities, including a 15% tax paid in kind with another dragon tooth, they were awarded visas embedded with magical wax—symbols of their temporary right to the city’s hospitality but also a reminder of the vigilant eye of [Zvervinka](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/zvervinka.md>)’s authorities.

Entering the city, the party made their way to [The Silver Wolf](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/the-silver-wolf.md>). The establishment welcomed them with the rich aroma of spiced tea and an atmosphere brimming with the promise of rest. They decided to wait for [Roman](<../../../people/other-humans/roman.md>), hoping for lodgings and information. Around lunchtime, [Roman](<../../../people/other-humans/roman.md>) arrived, regarding the party with a mix of hospitality, curiosity, and greed. He proposed that if the dwarven monster hunters ([Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)) could craft a silver wolf to grace his sign, he could facilitate many connections in the city. The rest of the afternoon, the party explored the city, noting the architectural and social divides between the lower city, along the marshy fens of the Ket, and the upper city on the hilly slopes above the river, dominated by the [Watcher's Spire](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/watcher-s-spire.md>). The day ended with an elaborate dinner at [The Silver Wolf](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/the-silver-wolf.md>), featuring a variety of local delicacies, including unusual preserved meats and spices. 

The next day, the party took on the challenge of crafting the silver wolf sign for [Roman](<../../../people/other-humans/roman.md>). Working in a private forge arranged by Roman, Kenzo used his woodcarving skills to construct a wax mold, and then Seeker and Riswynn used their talents to cast the silver, polish, and finish it. By the end of the day, the party had constructed a beautiful silver wolf sign. Roman, pleased with the gift, promised to arrange a meeting with [Lena](<../../../people/other-humans/lena-sorokina.md>) for the next afternoon, and also offered to arrange for the party's goods to be sold at market, for coin or exchanged for magic. 

The next morning, the party met with [Lena](<../../../people/other-humans/lena-sorokina.md>) at the [Watcher's Spire](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/watcher-s-spire.md>), after having left behind all detectable magic in a magically sealed chest at the entrance to the tower. Lena greeted the party as tea was set out for them, using magic to allow everyone to understand her words. Initially, Lena was puzzled by the party's story, questioning why such outsiders would seek [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>), in particular. Delwath's partial and incomplete, but quite plausible, admission that they were seeking information about a dimensional disturbance thought to have happened in this area convinced Lena to bargain. 

Lena offered the party that she would be willing to connect them to one of [Rodnya](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya.md>), who might be interested in their offer to exchange their monster hunting talents for information: [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>), specialists in evocation magic, based to the west; [Rodnya Morozmir](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-morozmir.md>), specialists in protective magic, to the southeast; and [Rodnya Zoryana](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-zoryana.md>), specialists in divination magic, to the southwest. 

After some brief deliberation, the party decided to ask Lena to reach out to [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>) on their behalf, despite her warning that they were currently weak, and desperate, making an alliance with them a high risk, high reward choice. The session ends the party leaves to return to [The Silver Wolf](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/the-silver-wolf.md>), with a promise from Lena that she would contact them when she had travel passes in hand for their journey west, to the headquarters of the [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>).

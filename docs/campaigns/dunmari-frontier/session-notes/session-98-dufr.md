The party heard three songs about merfolk:
[Ballad of the Jade Garden](<../../../primary-sources/songs/ballad-of-the-jade-garden.md>)
[Fog and Fortune](<../../../primary-sources/songs/fog-and-fortune.md>)
[Merfolk Fortunes](<../../../primary-sources/songs/merfolk-fortunes.md>)
### Key Rumors
- From [Juliana Maris](<../../../people/chardonians/juliana-maris.md>), the party learned that no one has returned from the [Merfolk](<../../../species/unusual-species/merfolk.md>) territory in the west in 20 years, except for the halfling captain [Milo Thistlefoot](<../../../people/halflings/milo-thistlefoot.md>) and his crew, and genuine merfolk artifacts are becoming difficult to find. 
- From rumors among sailors and people drinking in the taverns in [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), the party learned that if you want to breath water, there are two people you might seek. One, the [stoneborn](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/stoneborn/stoneborn.md>) alchemist [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>), lives in an isolated cave up the coast, and can brew potions. The other, a man obsessed with merfolk named [Dorian Almare](<../../../people/chardonians/dorian-almare.md>), touched by magic, left [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>) to find the merfolk 15 years ago and has not been seen since, but rumors persist of the "Mystic of Tamaro Bay" that might be Dorian. 
- From [Isabetta](<../../../people/chardonians/isabetta.md>), a young singer drawing a crowd at the [The Drunken Dolphin](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/the-drunken-dolphin.md>), a rowdy sailor's tavern in [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), the party heard the [Ballad of the Jade Garden](<../../../primary-sources/songs/ballad-of-the-jade-garden.md>), which seemed to spell out the location of the jade garden mentioned by [Thomas Hawke](<../../../people/tollenders/thomas-hawke.md>) and likely where the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../treasure/notable-items/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>) is located. 


## Narrative
We begin on the morning of May 5th, 1749, in the vibrant city of [Nevium](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/nevium.md>), situated in the Chardonian province of [Portalia](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/portalia.md>), after [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s succesful teleportation spell transported the party from the cold northern land of [Ursk](<../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>) to the balmy shores of the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/gulf-of-chardon.md>). Aware of their notoriety and wanted status within the [Chardonian Empire](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>), the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) quickly oriented themselves to their surroundings, strategizing their next move in relative secrecy.

Aiming for a discrete and quick escape from the city of [Nevium](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/nevium.md>), the party unfolds their Folding Boat, and, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) skillfully maneuvered the vessel out of [Nevium](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/nevium.md>), evading detection by naval patrols, setting a course northwest across the vast [Gulf of Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/gulf-of-chardon.md>). The journey by sea was marked by strategic conversations, as the he party sailed throughout the day, navigating the challenges of open water travel, until they sighted the remote shores of the [Apporian Peninsula](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>) by evening. Opting for caution, they anchored in a secluded cove to rest and plan their approach to the local settlements.

![Coast V1](../../../assets/coast-v1.jpg)

The following day, May 6th, [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) ventured into [Artevus](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/artevus.md>), a quiet and somewhat tired and run down  fishing village on the coast, in the province of [Portalia](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/portalia.md>), under the effects of an Alter Self spell to disguise his appearance. Posing a treasure hunter, he quickly learned that many local sailors had been pressed into naval service recently, but a local tavernkeeper pointed him to [Martino](<../../../people/chardonians/martino.md>), a retired fisherman and skilled navigator. Meanwhile, the rest of the party approached cautiously by boat, encountering [Pippa Goodbarrow](<../../../people/halflings/pippa-goodbarrow.md>), captain of the [Summer's Breeze](<../../../things/ships/summer-s-breeze.md>). 

After a few brief moments of confusion as [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) returned to his usual appearance, negotiations with Captain Goodbarrow proved fruitful, as the party convinced her and her crew to embark on an extended voyage northward, joined by [Martino](<../../../people/chardonians/martino.md>) as a navigator and guide. Their newly formed alliance set sail that afternoon, enjoying favorable winds and the camaraderie of the sea. Their journey continued into the night, arriving at the bustling port of [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), in the hilly coastal province of [Cedrano](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/cedrano.md>), after sunset.

In [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), the party split their efforts to gather information. [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) sought out [Juliana Maris](<../../../people/chardonians/juliana-maris.md>), a renowned collector of merfolk artifacts, hoping she might shed light on their quest. From her, they learned that merfolk fakes were becoming increasingly common, as it had been years since anyone had journeyed to the west coast of [Apporia](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>) and returned with genuine merfolk treasure. The only person to have done so recently was the daring halfling captain [Milo Thistlefoot](<../../../people/halflings/milo-thistlefoot.md>), aboard his ship [Stormdancer](<../../../things/ships/stormdancer.md>). But it had been a year since anyone had seen him, and [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s attempt to scry him failed. Meanwhile, [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) procured maps and navigational charts to aid their forthcoming journey. [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) relaxed at a seaside cafe, hoping to gather news and information but mostly taking in the scenery. [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) wandered the town, noting the complete absence of other dwarves, and the lack of any particularly notable crafting or smithy district, but not gaining much useful information about merfolk. 

![Castrella V2](../../../assets/castrella-v2.jpg)

As the day drew to a close, the party gathered at the docks, immersing themselves in the local culture. The local tavern, [The Drunken Dolphin](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/the-drunken-dolphin.md>), was alive with music and tales. [Isabetta](<../../../people/chardonians/isabetta.md>), a young singer, captured the crowd—and the party’s attention—with the [Ballad of the Jade Garden](<../../../primary-sources/songs/ballad-of-the-jade-garden.md>). Her song not only entertained but also hinted at the location of the jade garden mentioned by the mysterious [Thomas Hawke](<../../../people/tollenders/thomas-hawke.md>), aligning serendipitously with their quest. Asking about sources of magic to allow them to breath water, they learned of two possible people who could help: the stoneborn hermit and alchemist [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>), and the Mystic of Tamaro Bay, possibly the human known as [Dorian Almare](<../../../people/chardonians/dorian-almare.md>), who left [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>) years ago. 

The session ended in evening, as the party convinced the crew of [Summer's Breeze](<../../../things/ships/summer-s-breeze.md>) to rise in the predawn light and set sail north, moving fast and sailing around the clock, to hopefully find Milo, who the party suspected may be in danger.

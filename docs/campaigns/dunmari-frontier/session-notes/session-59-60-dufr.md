## Session Notes

### Prequel

We begin as [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) arrives in the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), in a meadow of flowers that bloom and unfurl into butterflies as their petals open, taking wing and blowing away. Getting his bearings, with the help of [Typhina](<../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) and the maps and notes of [Ulfgar Frostbeard](<../../../people/dwarves/ulfgar-frostbeard.md>), from [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) stands trying to look confident in this strange place. A giggle from nearby turns out to come from a small fairy, a pixie, who warns [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) he must have the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>)’s permission to travel through his domain of [Fortune's Rest](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/fortune-s-rest.md>), and invites him to come to court, by way of polymorphing him into a dragonfly. 

The court itself is a vast, elegant outdoor casino, staffed by beautiful [Fey](<../../../species/children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>) in white robes, and filled with games of chance of all kinds. A band of satyrs plays a lively tune, and food and drink flow freely. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) wanders, avoiding food and drink and watching the games, until eventually watching a lizard race and deciding to bet. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) bets on one of the losers, and suffers an explosion of black sticky ooze in his face with a rancid, bitter taste as a consequence, but manages to avoid any more severe effects. 

![Prince Of Luck Court](../../../assets/prince-of-luck-court.png){width="500"}
Eventually [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) begins to wander towards the palace in the center of the gardens, although it seems difficult to leave the games and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) ends up wandering for some unknown stretch of time before finding himself in a formal garden just outside the palace. The flowers here do not have normal flowers, but rather dense lobes of light of burnished gold, glowing. Somewhat impulsively, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) reaches out and touches one, which bursts in a flash of light, blinding him.

A quick casting of dispel magic removes the blindness, but catches the attention of the [Prince of Luck](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>). The music stops, and he confronts [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), but quickly forgives him, and asks him to come tell his story at court. After some back and forth, discussing what [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) wants and where he came from, the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>) offers [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) a chance to roll for his favor. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), in a moment of pure chutzpah, decides to use his magic dice to try to win, rolling two six sided dice for a total of thirteen. For a moment it seems as if the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>) will be angry, but then he decides to reward [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) for his attempt. 

We end as [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) rests in the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>)’s court, after agreeing to help resolve the wild magic storm growing on the border of Fortune’s Rest, in exchange for safe passage across the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>)’s domain. 

### Session 1

We begin in the court of the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>), as [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) meets his companions who will venture into the wild magic storm: [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>), a Winter Knight from [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>), also bordering the wild magic storm; [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>), a light cleric from [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>); and [Mikasa](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/mikasa.md>), a samurai from a distant fey realm, who is helping in exchange for passage home from the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>). [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>) and [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>) know the way, so the party sets out from the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>)’s court towards the Crystal Peak, at the center of the wild magic storm.

![Crystal Peak](../../../assets/crystal-peak.png){width="500"}

After some time traveling through the wonders of the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), the party approaches the Crystal Peak, a mountain entirely made of gems and crystals. Between [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>)’s flight, [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>) and [Mikasa](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/mikasa.md>)’s ability to scale sheer walls, and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) polymorphing into a dragonfly getting to the top is easy. Except for when [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) casts Polymorph, something breaks off from the top of the mountain and a giant round stone comes hurling down the mountainside. [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>) and [Mikasa](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/mikasa.md>) are able to dodge out of the way, fortunately. 

The top of the mountain has a giant crater, as if something crashed into it, leaving an open gash that leads down into a cave structure below. The cave is almost like a massive bubble in the mountain, and at the bottom is a crashed geode, split open. Descending to investigate, giant dragonfly [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is swarmed and attacked by an animated cloud of crystal fragments. [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>) and [Mikasa](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/mikasa.md>) run down the walls of the cave, trying to draw the attention of the clouds of crystal fragments, while [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>) and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) fly down. 

As the party deals with the crystal shards, [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) casts Catapult to try to break one of the swarms to pieces, and vanishes, appearing in another cave, that looks inhabited. The rest of the party manages to deal with the crystal fragments, and find their way to the room [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is in, on the next level down.

Here, the party meets [Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>), a strange fey creature with wild hair, a multicolored frizzy mess, and clearly a master of this crystal mountain domain. [Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>) is somewhat shifty, and not completely straightforward with the party. But it seems that after the crash, which leaked some kind of uncontrolled magic, [Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>) summoned a creature with a nose for gems to help, and it ended up swallowing the shards of the geode. After which things started to go heywire, and magic got weird. [Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>) tried to kill the creature with magic, but it fled, deeper into the mountain. Somehow, the creature needs to be destroyed, and the geode shards retrieved and destroyed, to end the chaos. Unfortunately, [Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>) admits, the spells he cast came alive (some aftereffect of the geode, he thinks), and might be waiting for the party. Still, it is the only way, he says, so the party proceeds.

[Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>) leads them to another cave, with polished reflective crystal walls, where they find a portal to the deep cave where the creature, a xorn, can be found. The creature has been petrified by the chaotic magic, turned to a statue of stone - surrounded by living versions of all the spells that [Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>) or the party cast in the mountain, which immediately attack. While [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>), [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>), and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) try to hold off the wild magic, [Mikasa](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/mikasa.md>) lunges for the statute, attempting to crack it in two to shatter the magic crystal and end the wild magic storm. 

[Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>) manages to temporarily paralyze one of the spells with Dispel Magic, and [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>) holds off a number of smaller, weaker spells, along with the echo of the giant dragonfly [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) polymorphed into. However, [Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>)’s lightning bolt and force hand, as well as [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s catapult, are real trouble. Fortunately, [Mikasa](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/mikasa.md>) is able to crack open the statue. As it cracks, the room vibrates for a moment, and with a last wild burst of chaotic magic energy, the storm ends and magic begins to rebalance.

We end as [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>), and [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>) continue their journey to [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>) and beyond, in search of the fey crossing that will reunite [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) with his friends, as [Mikasa](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/mikasa.md>) returns to receive her favor from the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/prince-of-luck.md>) and go home. But not before a grateful [Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>) gifts [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) fragments of crystalized magic, from a mysterious source, to do with what he will. 

The source of the geode, which caused the wild magic storm and the living spells, remains mysterious; and [Illaran](<../../../people/fey/illaran.md>) won't reveal where he came by or created the crystalized magic he gave to [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>). But, at least to [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s eyes, they seem unrelated. 

### Session 2

We begin in the fey realm of [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>), where [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>) and [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>) have brought [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), in order for rest and also learn more about the fey crossing he is searching for. After spending some time in [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>), during which [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) explored and spent time constructing a magical glove with the shards of crystalized magic to let him manipulate spells, the party has left for [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), where Lastlight Falls – the fey crossing [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is searching for – is located.

[Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>) is a decaying realm, in disrepair since the Queen of Sunsets, the archfey of [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), vanished many years ago. To travel there needs a guide, and [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>) knows one: the strange human warrior [Caulaus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/caulaus.md>) Aportino. 

[Caulaus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/caulaus.md>) leads the party into [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), through the Golden Hills on the border of [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>) and [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>), to Longshadow Ravine, the only clear path out of the hills into the plains of [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>). However, the ravine is guarded by a cursed giant with an evil glare, [Vondar](<../../../people/giants/vondar.md>) One-Eye, who the party later learns demands a toll of a memory to pass. Refusing to pay the toll, the party fights, trying to avoid the cursed eye. As the party wears the giant down, the combat seems to be going their way, until [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is cursed by [Vondar](<../../../people/giants/vondar.md>)’s glare. Nonetheless the party defeats the giant, removes the curse on [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), and investigates the camp, wondering about the cauldron of bubbling memories. [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) is nearly pulled into the cauldron before being dragged away by his friends, and the party realizes the better part of valor is not messing with strange fey things they don’t understand, and leave. 

Beyond the Golden HIlls and [Vondar](<../../../people/giants/vondar.md>)’s ravine is a vast expanse of open plains, presumably once beautiful in the evening light of sunset, now dry and pale. To find Lastlight Falls, the first goal is to find the crashed Cloud Palace, where the [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>), one of the few of the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>)’s court who remains in [Amberglow](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), resides. The palace is a wreck, twisted and broken and drained of color. [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) is wearing elegant dress and courtly jewelry, but her skin and nearly all her clothes and hair are bleached pale and colorless. 

![Amberglow Cloud Palace](../../../assets/amberglow-cloud-palace.png){width="500"}

[Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) and [Caulaus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/caulaus.md>) speak about their apparent shared history, with the Lady telling [Caulaus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/caulaus.md>) he cannot leave, and cannot be forgiven until the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>) returns, since it was her that [Caulaus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/caulaus.md>) wronged. Until then, he must remain in the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>). Speaking with [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), [Lady Eventide](<../../../people/fey/lady-eventide.md>) asks what he will give in exchange for a way across the fey crossing at Lastlight Falls. Pale and colorless, she asks for the color of his beard, and eventually agrees to take instead a streak of color from his hair. In exchange, she gives him a [thread](<../treasure/treasure-from-solo-adventures/sunset-thread.md>) from her dress, made by the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>), who as known for her way with spinning thread of magic from the colors of the sunset. 

The party is then told the way to proceed, past a line of trees that guard Lastlight Falls, and to be careful not to touch the shadows of the trees. The party manages to move forward carefully, avoiding most of the dangers of the shadows, and passing through the trees to the sight of Lastlight Falls. 

We end as [Raven](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/raven.md>) leaves to return to the defense of [Shimmersong](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>), and [Spirala](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/spirala.md>), [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), and [Caulaus](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/caulaus.md>) see on the top of the cliffs of Lastlight Falls, [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) sitting and waiting.

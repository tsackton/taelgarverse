# Faldrak's Journal Notes

*4 Barukhelm 5881*

*My first adventure in more than a decade succeeded beyond my wildest imagination. That [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) fellow sure knows how to pick his friends. I was not sure what to think when I first met them: they seemed rather prone to excessive chatter, and terminal indecision. I was afraid it would be like being back on my travels with Lyrial and her friends. So much time sitting around debating, so little time doing! Although I guess it was in one of those rambling discursions that she told me about the [Edge of Echoes](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/cymea/edge-of-echoes.md>) in the first place.*

*But once we got moving, I couldn't help but wonder at the powerful oddities they carried and their skill at using them. A folding boat I've seen, sure; but a mirror that reveals the history of things? That was a sight. And all [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s friends proved quite adept in battle: I think I would have been drowned by water [elementals](<../../../species/children-of-the-divine/elementals.md>) if they had not leapt to my defense.*

*And flight! Ah, to fly again! It was nothing like the flying carpet we borrowed back in the day. To be able to think and just go where you wished it - truly something else. Somehow the fey step trick I learned from Lyrial feels cheap in comparison now.*

*Of course, my goal was to make my dear Pebblepeep fly, and I can't believe how successful I was! I surprise even myself sometimes, ha ha. All the hard work outfitting this ship (oh, this ship! I wonder if they'll let me stay, or maybe even fly it some day?) was well worth it.*

*It will be hard going back to life in [Tollen](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) after this.*

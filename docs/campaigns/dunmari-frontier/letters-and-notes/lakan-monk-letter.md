title: Lakan Monk Letter

The blessings of Laka be with you, and may his divine grace guide my words to you. As the season of blessing approaches, may your deeds earn the divine grace of Sonkar and may her judgement look favorably upon your year. 

Your news brings little clarity to my troubled thoughts. For it seems the time is coming soon when I must take up the ancient role of our order and declare before all whom the gods wish to rule over Dunmar, and yet I cannot see what course of action Laka would have me choose. How the gods must wail and gnash at the frailties of us feeble humans they must trust to discern their will, and be their divine hand on earth. Never have I felt more unworthy of the power trusted to me by Laka. 

My dreams remain filled with the corpses of my people, the rotting bodies of the Dunmari across the plains, the nightmares of war I wrote about in my last letter. And yet now I wonder, did I miss the message of the gods in my haste and fear? For when I force myself to look, to see the nightmare, to stare into the darkness, I see the corpses on the field of battle shake and sway, and begin to rise. Perhaps my dreams have been a warning of this creature to the East, all along.

And if that is the fear the gods would warn me of, do I throw the legitimacy of Laka behind [Sura](<../../../people/dunmari/sura.md>), as the fire of Aagir so obviously burns in her, despite my misgivings that the fires of Aagir do not make one a just ruler? And yet when I pray on Karnas, I hear nothing, silence: if no god will speak for him, shall I? I will not burden you more with my troubles, for you must face dangers of your own. 

Before I close and deliver my words to this foreign god to carry them to you, Rishii has this message for you, Kenzo: 

"In these uncertain times, when all paths seem fraught, trust in yourself. You have grown into great power, no longer the fleeing boy we took in half a decade ago, and I could not be more proud of you."

May the wisdom of Laka guide your path.

Yours in fellowship,
Speaker Lara

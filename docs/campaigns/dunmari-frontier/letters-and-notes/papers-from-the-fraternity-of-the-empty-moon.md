title: Papers from the Fraternity of the Empty Moon
---

(written in a strange language, a variant of Abyssal)

- Pages and pages of calendars with notes and calculations on them, tracking phases of the moon. Most of these seem to be newer, written in the same handwriting.
- There is also what looks like an older scroll, written in the same tongue, loosely translated as:
>	When the sixth moon rises in the betrayer sky,
>	When the deepest echo of madness is nigh,
>	In the ancient cave of the Mad One's soul.
>	Thirteen brethren, thirteen prayers,
>	Thirteen cold iron spears prepared,
>	Will bring forth the howl of empty despair.
>	And Jinnik's curse will claim the land.
- There are several pages of notes. You can see a few diagrams, one that seems to shown thirteen poles or spears, point down, arranged in a circle, with the details on the spears revealing "Mad One, come to us, let Jinnik's howl be heard!". These spears are identical to those found in the lair. 
- There is a long discussion of the "ancient cave of the Mad One's soul" and its connection to Pandemonium, linking it to the cave to the north.
- There is what seems to be someone's notes to themselves, "We must find a way past the Dunmari's maze, and we must find a way to get to the Dunmari city without attracting attention. Maybe the old witch can help, if I can find something to trade worthy of her."

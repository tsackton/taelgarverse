title: Two Letters from Stormcaller Tower

"Tell [Eudomes](<../../../people/historical-figures/eudomes.md>) that we will arrive in two weeks time. We expect to speak to the captured being, whom you call [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>). The [Occulta Ludum](<../../../groups/drankorian-societies/occulta-ludum.md>) will be overjoyed to hear the binding seems to have worked, but tell [Eudomes](<../../../people/historical-figures/eudomes.md>) to be cautious above all else, keep this secret. Giants are dangerous in all their forms, even to us, and binding a storm giant at the peak of their power is the most dangerous business of all."

"I hope this message finds you alive. You all must flee west as quickly as possible. There is no time to worry about [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>). Head west: [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) may be safe. A plague of great magical power has struck, the Emperor is already dead, several Magistri teleported to safety but where they have gone is unknown. [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>) has fallen and the east is in chaos. I fear the danger is spreading quickly, and this may be the end of us all."

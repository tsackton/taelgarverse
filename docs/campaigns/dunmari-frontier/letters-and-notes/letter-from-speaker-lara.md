Dear [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>),

The blessings of [Laka](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/laka.md>) be with you, and may his divine grace guide my words to your hand. Your long silence has weighed heavily on my mind, and when I heard that [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) was in [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), and was assured of your continued presence among the living, I was grateful, taking the opportunity to pass on what news I can.

We have had no word of [Johar](<../../../people/dunmari/johar.md>) for more than a month now, and tensions in [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) only increase. I received a letter in August, a short message from [Johar](<../../../people/dunmari/johar.md>) to say that he had arrived safely in [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>), thanks to your aid. And another soon after [Aagirvala](<../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/aagirvala.md>) ([Aagir](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/aagir.md>)’s feast day, generally in early Oct), saying he had arrived safely in [Nayahar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/western-dunmar/nayahar.md>). But nothing since. No word of negotiations, no word that Karnas has even spoken with him. I fear tensions are only increasing. With [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) pressing for war and accusing the Chardonians of cursing him, we are balanced on a knife’s edge, and the slightest false move could tip [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) into war. 

Worse, [Laka](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/laka.md>) has given no guidance I can understand, despite our constant prayer. My dreams are filled with nightmares of war, of the rotting corpses of my people; it is clear enough the gods do not want Dunmari to fight Dunmari. And yet until and unless the Samraat [Nayan Karnas](<../../../people/dunmari/nayan-karnas.md>) will speak to his sister, in good faith, I see no clear way to prevent bloodshed and destruction. 

I fear to place more burdens on you, for I know you are weighed by many troubles, perhaps some greater than the fate of [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>). And you have saved the Dunmari twice over already; I cannot ask more of you. So I do not write to enlist your aid. I only wish you to know where things stand, and to ask that should you see a path through the darkness, to guide me to that path. 

Yours in fellowship and in the divine light of [Laka](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/laka.md>),

Speaker [Lara](<../../../people/dunmari/lara.md>)

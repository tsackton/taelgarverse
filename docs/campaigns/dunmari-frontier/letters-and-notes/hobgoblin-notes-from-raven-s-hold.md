title: Hobgoblin Notes from Raven's Hold
---
Found in the Dwarven outpost at Raven's Hold. A series of dated entries, from the early 1600s. Translation is full of things like "14 June. Year of Simmering Blood. Captain Melvung of the Blooded Eye Banner reports two engagements with the horse scum. Seventeen weaklings and 11 horses gloriously dispatched. Four Blooded Eye soldiers earned the ultimate reward for heroism. One Blooded Eye soldier dispatched to the eternal cold for cowardice." In goes on like this for some time, primarily a record of battles fought, enemies killed, and the like. 

## Looseleaf Hobgoblin Journal. 
Taken from Raven's Hold. A leather satchel holding unbound pages that include notes and sketches that might portray troop movements. About 150 years old. Â This describes the ascent and decline of the fortunes of the Blackened Claw clan during a long war against the Dunmari. This is a logistics report: troop movements, draft numbers, food supply, treasure and gold.

# Treasure Recovered from Vetta

- The [Flaming Tempest](<../../../things/ships/flaming-tempest.md>), once [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>)'s pirate ship. Badly damaged. Potentially worth 20,000 gold if repaired and fixed up, considerably less in it's current state. 
- 2000 sp in Tollender silver coins (from [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>)'s cabin)
- 200 gp in [Sembara](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) gold coins (from [Urgall](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>)'s cabin)
- Captain's [log and charts](<../treasure/flaming-tempest-log-books.md>) from The [Flaming Tempest](<../../../things/ships/flaming-tempest.md>) (allowing [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) to reconstruct the journey of the [Flaming Tempest](<../../../things/ships/flaming-tempest.md>), with time and effort)
- A scroll written in a cipher, locked in a chest in the captain's cabin on the [Flaming Tempest](<../../../things/ships/flaming-tempest.md>), eventually [deciphered](<../treasure/urgall-s-scroll.md>)
- A small silver statue of a demon with ruby eyes
- A collection of Tollender goods, that survived water damage: 20 bolts of brilliantly dyed red cloth; 4 crates of fine linen shits; 2 crates of red Tollender cloaks; 6 small crates of beaver fur hats in a variety of styles. 
- 8 swords and 4 spears of [Skaer Steel](<../../../things/materials/skaer-steel.md>) (used by Skaer warriors killed on [Vetta](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/vetta.md>); gifted to party in their honor by [Vaallinen](<../../../people/skaer/vaallinen.md>))
- A slightly decayed helmet worn by [Urgall the Black](<../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>)

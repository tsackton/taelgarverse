### Books from Apollyon's Study

A large book with a deep crimson cover made of bloodstained human skin, radiating necromancy magic, and outlining the process by which a spellcaster can become a lich. Briefly laid a curse on Seeker. Destroyed by Dimitaur. 

A locked book with a plain leather cover, unassuming from the outside. Written in a cypher. Contains notes about Apollyon's spells, functioning as a spellbook. Also contains information and research about the process of lich transformation, and the mechanisms by which the forge in Apollyon's tower can be used. 

### Remnants of Apollyon's Constructs

Two small metallic flies, about two inches across and made of a strange black metal, perhaps some kind of unusual iron. Inert.

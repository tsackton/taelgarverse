### Found
- A [Drankorian Message Stone](<../../../things/magic-items/drankorian-message-stone.md>) used by the Fides Lucaris. Found in a hidden lead box, and once possessed by the woman whose skeleton remains in the elemental forge. [Lucius](<../../../people/chardonians/lucius.md>), a boy in a small village in [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) has its pair, and thinks it is his imaginary friend Benji talking. 
- A small crystal vial containing four doses of Universal Solvent. Found in a hidden lead box, and used to destroy the silver threads binding the trapped elemental in the elemental forge. 
- A [magical gray cloak](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4606-cloak-of-elvenkind). Also found in the lead box. 
- Cold Box. Found in the pantry/storeroom in the living quarters. A 3 foot by 3 foot stone chest that preserves food kept inside indefinitely.
- Pitcher of Purity. A silver water pitcher found in the bedroom in the living quarters. Any non-magical liquid put inside turns permanently to pure water. 
- A locked spellbook. Found in the hidden lead box in the jeweler's workshop in the Elemental Forge. Once possessed by the woman whose skeleton remains in the elemental forge, the [Fides Lucaris spy](<../../../people/historical-figures/fides-lucaris-spy.md>) who attempted to free [Sh’shethis](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/shshethis.md>). The spellbook's contains are currently unknown. 
- A silver wand that functions as an arcane focus. Found in the hidden lead box and also once possessed by the woman whose skeleton remains in the elemental forge, the [Fides Lucaris spy](<../../../people/historical-figures/fides-lucaris-spy.md>) who attempted to free [Sh’shethis](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/shshethis.md>). If a wizard attunes to the silver wand, it gives +1 to spell attacks and spell DC, and also allows the attuned user to cast the Dancing Lights cantrip without requiring concentration.

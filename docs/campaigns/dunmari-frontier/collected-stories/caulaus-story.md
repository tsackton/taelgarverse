(as told to [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), [Session 61 (DuFr)](<../session-notes/session-61-dufr.md>))

I was the only child, much to my parents disappointment. I don't remember much of my childhood schooling, military training.

My first clear memory is being appointed commander of the third Sylvan legion. I swore allegiance personally to the Emperor. I remember the the place and the ceremony like it was yesterday. [Helea](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/helea.md>), a blond woman. She was very striking, wearing the ceremonial robes of gold, and a golden crown with a diamond set in it. I gave my oath to her. Now she was
kind in private, although in public she always seemed quite fearsome. What she said to me I still remember. She said, while your oath is to me your obligation is to the ideal of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), a haven of safety and peace from the darkness, for all humankind. Remember that, and your command will be a great one. I like to think that I did, although I admit I cannot remember.

My next memory is a battle, fighting in a forest, my soldiers standing fast backed by the war mages of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>). The war mages were a sight to see, rank upon rank of firing their spells at the enemy.

I remember being warned by the elves of a danger of an army of giants coming from the mountains. The battle was fierce, but I remember most clearly the face of this frost giant I defeated. He was huge. Twenty, thirty feet tall, his head nearly as big as myself, his eyes angry and clouded as I avoided his axe and struck the killing blow. I remember peace coming to his face, and a murmur so low that only I could hear it. Some message, but I can't remember the words. Something about a curse. Perhaps the [Helea](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/helea.md>), and a shadowy force. I know not what.

I remember an Elven city, growing from the trees, all golden, white, and elegance spiraling in the branches. It was like nothing you would ever have seen. Elves everywhere. Many more than I usually would have seen. A large feast full of life and song and wine and beauty. I remember bringing an urgent message to them. I can't remember of what, but something that had to be kept secret from the Imperial channels.

Later, I remember a messenger coming to my command, her horse nearly ridden to death. She great greeted me with the handshake, and I don't know why this name stands out, but the Peregrine fellowship. Something I was part of, a society of travelers and pilgrims, a group dedicated to finding fellowship and support on their frontier. She was exhausted. Her horse rode almost to death. I remember the message. The message is the one thing I remember clearly of the whole day. The [Omnis Pura](<../../../groups/drankorian-societies/omnis-pura.md>)  have struck the first blow. [Helea](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/helea.md>) has been killed, and war is coming. I remember that because that's the day the war started. The one I keep asking about. I guess it has ended for many years now, you know not how.

I remember hosting a feast, a celebration. There was tables heaped with delicacies, meat pies, a roast pig, red cheese, even some rare elvin delicacies, a cake made with a rare fruit, some tree, the sisila tree, I think. I don't remember what that means, but it was a big deal. The elves were sharing it. Wine poured freely. The soldiers were happy. I remember the songs they sang, long live the new [Vestian](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/vestian.md>), long may he live, may he swifty defeat the traitors. Even the elven ambassador was there, and some of the locals. They were the people who worship strange little gods.

I remember marching at the head of my legion arrayed for war, leaving my camp after several victories against the allies of the Omni Pura. We're marching towards a town. The name sticks in my mind. I do not know why. Erusum I was hoping not to fight. We were going to destroy the teleportation circle there. There were circles we used to travel many miles by magic. Are they not still there? Anyway, we were to hold this teleportation circle against the [Omnis Pura](<../../../groups/drankorian-societies/omnis-pura.md>) and their allies. And I remember leading the charge into the great hall where the circle sits, only to discover the mages waiting. The world turned upside down as we were flung to the ceiling, as if gravity had reversed. And I do not remember more.

My last memory is the one I shared at the beginning of this when we met. How I came to be here, fighting the dragon. Red and black scales, losing the fight, a rout, running, finding the elven stones, the treaty stones, reaching one, and appearing here.

Since then it's fragmentary. I remember the Cloud Spinner, but can't say how or why, or who she was, or what I did to wrong her. I remember wandering, helping travelers, remembering, forgetting, remembering, and forgetting again and again.

I think it's been my curse. Every time I came close to remembering my past and what had happened, and where I was really, and how long it had been, something happened and I'd forget again. Go back to that day that I had just come through believing that there was still a war to win.

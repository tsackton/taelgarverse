title: Nameless Chardonian Warrior's Story
---
(as told to [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) in [Session 55-56 (DuFr)](<../session-notes/session-55-56-dufr.md>))

As [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) listens, the warrior tells his tale: he was born in a small village outside [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), and got caught up in the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), fighting with elves against dragons and hobgoblins. After the war, though he survived, he could not escape the loss, death, and destruction, could not keep his familyâ€™s farm alive as sickness spread across the land.

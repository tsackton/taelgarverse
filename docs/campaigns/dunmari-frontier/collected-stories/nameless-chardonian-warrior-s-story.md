# Nameless Chardonian Warrior's Story
([collected by](<../session-notes/session-64-dufr.md>) [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>))

As [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) listens, the warrior tells his tale: he was born in a small village outside [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), and got caught up in the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), fighting with [elves](<../../../species/elves.md>) against [Dragons](<../../../species/unusual-species/dragons.md>) and Hobgoblins. After the war, though he survived, he could not escape the loss, death, and destruction, could not keep his familyâ€™s farm alive as sickness spread across the land.

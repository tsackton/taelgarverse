title: Nameless Chardonian Warrior's Story
---

(as told to [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) in [Session 55-56 (DuFr)](<../session-notes/session-55-56-dufr.md>))

As [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) listens, the warrior tells his tale: he was born in a small village outside Chardon, and got caught up in the Great War, fighting with elves against dragons and hobgoblins. After the war, though he survived, he could not escape the loss, death, and destruction, could not keep his family’s farm alive as sickness spread across the land.

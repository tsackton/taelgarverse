title: Treeâ€™s Story
---
(as told to [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) in [Session 55-56 (DuFr)](<../session-notes/session-55-56-dufr.md>))

The story of a great tree of the jungles is a long, slow tale. Kenzo listens, and hears the slow ache of a seed waiting to germinate, the long age of darkness that bursts into a vibrant thrill of sunlight. 

The impossible urge to grow, grow, grow, stretch as fast as possible, to bask in the sun, to drink up the songs of the earth below, reaching for the currents of nutrients flowing beneath the ground. 

The growing sense of awareness, the melodies of roots forming a harmony of notes, an orchestra, a symphony of the forest itself. 

The tickles of birds and monkeys and the life of the jungle, the percussion of their touch across branches, the gifts of fruit and seed granted them in hopes they will spread Tree's descendants across the land. 

The long, slow pace of the seasons, breaths as long as years, the pulse of rain and sun and sun and rain, reaching deeper and deeper, anchoring Tree's ever-taller and stronger body deeper and deeper in the rich, life-giving earth.  

The thrill of connection upon hearing the song of a daughter-tree in the forest symphony, the dance between wood and spirit indicating a fragment of the forest soul has found a home.

title: Cecilia Lister's Story

(as told to [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) in [Session 75 (DuFr)](<../session-notes/session-75-dufr.md>))

As she works on [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)'s tattoo, Cecilia tells her story. 

She was born to a modest family of fisherfolk. It was a hard childhood, full of grueling work gutting and cleaning fish. Her parents rarely had spare coin for luxuries, but tried their best to provide a safe home, a dry roof, and enough food for Cecilia and her two brothers. 

The best parts of her childhood were the days her mother would take her to the big market near the docks in [Fiskurth](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/fiskurth.md>), where she could watch the bustle of the city. She tells [Kenzo](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) she remembers being fascinated by the bright colors of the bolts of cloth being loaded onto merchant ships, by the songs of the halfling selling strange-smelling spices, by cheap illusions of the market performers trying to earn a quick coin with a flashy display of simple magic. 

This might have been her life, selling fish at market until she was old, following in her parents footsteps. But, when she was 14, everything changed. 

In the spring of 1708, a sickness swept through [Tollen](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), a wasting disease that hit the crowded streets of [Fiskurth](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/fiskurth.md>) and [Skepwalk](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/skepwalk.md>) particularly hard, especially among the many families without spare coin or labor to donate to a temple for a blessing of healing. Cecilia's older brother was sick for a month, and while he eventually recovered he was cursed with spells of weakness ever after. Cecilia found herself forced to join her father on the ocean in his place. Learning to sail and read the ocean was hard and did not come naturally to her. 

But, she recalls, the colors! The ever-changing ocean, the swirls of blues and greens and the motion of the waves, and especially the glitter of moonlight or the shine of the setting sun from sea -- she became obsessed with these images. She took to filching dyes and colored inks when she could, from the market, and late at night she would sneak out of her room and paint. She had no paper, so she took the city as her canvas, and especially painting intricate designs on the prows of ships, in secret, focusing on the small boats of the fisherfolk of the city. 

There was magic in her touch, somehow, a resonance with the ocean she could not consciously describe in her work. While many questioned the art appearing on their boats, it soon became obvious that the small boats with her designs had an uncanny ability to weather storms and rough seas. Before long, she was discovered. 

She was embarrassed at first, she recalled, not wanting to make a scene or be famous, and not wanting anyone to ask where she got the inks and paints. But soon the [Dyer's Guild](<../../../groups/tollen-guilds/dyer-s-guild.md>) got word, and offered to waive the usual fees to enroll her as an apprentice, and a whole new world opened up to her. She quickly surpassed her mentors, and by her early 20s her protective charms painted on ships of all kinds were highly sought in [Tollen](<../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>).

After a decade of this, having long ago earned enough coin for her parents and older brother to stop working, and to set her younger brother up as the captain of a merchant ship, she grew bored. The simple art of protective charms did not push her talents, she said.  Soon after her 37th birthday, her parents died, and she found herself needing to move on from the ocean.

So in her late 30s she turned to tattoos, marveling in the complexity of the interplay between the person and the magic of the ink. And this, along with using her wealth and position to aid struggling young artists, has been her joy and passion ever since.

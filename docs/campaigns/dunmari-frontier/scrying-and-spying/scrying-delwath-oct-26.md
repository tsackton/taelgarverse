{title: Scrying Delwath Oct 26}
---
**(Oct 21 - Oct 26)**

#### [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>)

One scry on [Havdar](<../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) fails, but the second time, you see him leading what seem to be fresh recruits in a drill. He is fired up, angry, riling up the recruits as they practice combat, both individually and in maneuvers on horseback. They seem to be well-equipped.

#### Radomir

You attempt to scry on [Radomir](<../../../people/other-humans/radomir.md>) on Oct 26, just from the name and description, on the morning of Oct 26th after hearing his story the night before. You see a sickly man dressed in bulky but ratty and worn furs, maybe in his early 40s, with a black-and-gray beard, chopping wood outside a one-room house in some cold, northern land. He is shivering as he works, methodically building up his wood pile. It is snowy, and near sunset - he must be very far to the east.

#### Kharsan

It takes a lot of dipping in and out of [Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) to get a sense of what is happening, especially because scry doesn't give you an aerial view. The situation in the [Monastery of Bhishma](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/monastery-of-bhishma.md>) seems much as you left it - there is a small [orc](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) patrol, but otherwise it is quiet. In the few random places in the north of [Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) you view that you walked through, the most notable thing is how the ground is disturbed, dug up, almost purposefully excavated. Almost like exhumed graves. You also see [Orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), both living and dead, as well as numerous skeletons moving about the city, and some creepier undead, zombie-like creatures with bloated, decaying bodies that cough and wheeze and seem to be surrounded by faint clouds of blood or some other kind of reddish mist. And you hear the ringing sounds of forges - the [Orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) seem to be in high gear constructing weapons.

#### Karawa

The monsoon has been good to [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), and the rebuilding is in full swing. From your perspective at the oasis, you can see a new caravanserai under construction, close to the open fields used for tents and camps during the [Festival of Rebirth](<../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/festival-of-rebirth.md>), and you can see new date palms beginning to grow around the oasis, the burned husks of the old trees having been cleared away.

#### Eudomes' Tower

First scrying attempt on [Stormcaller Tower](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>) fails. In your second attempt, you see nothing but whirling winds and lightning, visibility almost nothing, the calm that was at the center of the storm when you last visited seemingly gone.

#### Tokra

It is hard to get a great sense of the city from just watching one spot for 10 minutes, but you do get the idea that this is a city full of tension right now. People are openly carrying weapons on the streets.

People are nervous, here. [Kirian’s](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/kirians.md>) seems to be a Karnas establishment - once you overhear two people talking about when the Samraat (referring to [Nayan Karnas](<../../../people/dunmari/nayan-karnas.md>)) will send more troops to quiet things down, and when the Lakan monks will finally pick a side (which the person seems sure will be Karnas). Another time, someone comes in, who [Kirian](<../../../people/dunmari/kirian.md>) seems to recognize, because you here a shout, "Get out! No recruiting here!"

The army camp is still in place, and seems to have grown slightly, if anything. Soldiers are drilling, but there is also a feeling of weariness, like you can only stay alert without action for so long. This is not a camp that has recently seen battle.

### Kadmos and companions

You scry on [Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>), [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>), and [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) a few times. This doesn't always work - [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>), in particular, seems good at resisting your scrys. And [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>), as always, seems unscryable.

However, you piece together that they are traveling, of course. Scry doesn't really give you a wide view of the landscape so it is not easy to piece together where they are.

[Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>) rarely talks and when you view him he is either riding seemingly slightly ahead of the group, in silence, watching; or sitting in silence some distance from the camp. Once you see the interior of a quiet inn, and [Hektor](<../../../people/chardonians/hektor.md>) sitting alone at a table eating stew.

[Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>) is more social. You see here polishing her armor, and generally taking care of it, tinkering with it. You also once catch her in conversation with someone you know: [Vola](<../../../people/chardonians/vola.md>), who you gather is traveling with them. [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>) is telling [Vola](<../../../people/chardonians/vola.md>) she is glad she could join them, but the conversation seems kind of one sided. [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>) mentions she is excited to sail through the canal, marveling at it as a feat of engineering.

[Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) you fail to scry twice, but do see him once, on Oct 25th. He is sitting with [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) on the deck of a ship, watching [Antonia](<../../../people/chardonians/antonia.md>) and watching a mage of some sort in sky blue robes with a deep hood shadowing their face, sitting in the middle of a circle of some kind of powder on the deck of the ship, chanting. He turns to speak with [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>), saying, "Can we trust her, really?", when [Kadmos](<../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) glances around, and makes a gesture to [Casian](<../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) to stop talking.

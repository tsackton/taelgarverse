title: Philosopher's Information Concerning Frankar
---

Your gift, though generously given, is a common trinket, a device made in great numbers during the age of Drankor to facilitate logistical support for the armies of the Empire. Though the trick of their easy construction has been lost, many hundred still survive, and there is little new to learn from this trinket.

Nonetheless, your eagerness to understand the fate of your brother is noble, and some answers are not difficult to come by. So these now I share with you.

Your brother Frankar was indeed seen alive on the elemental plane of fire some years ago. When, exactly, I cannot say, but at least five years past by the standard reckoning of your people. It is said a curious dwarf, bearing remarkable resemblance to your description of Frankar, was sighted within the illustrious city of Bronzehall, in the company of an efreeti known as Zephyra. Whether he was willingly traveling with this creature, or a captive, was not clear, and the nature of their association is, and was, elusive. While the efreet are often cruel, they do greatly value those who possess rare talents, so perhaps, one can hope, he was traveling as a trusted advisor, and not a slave. They were heading, according to those who saw them, towards the Cinder Wastes. Some claimed that they sought knowledge of the Oracle's Pyre, though what such a thing was, or is, is not known to me, beyond the obvious link from the name with both fire and divination magic. 

More, I cannot say. Perhaps those who saw him, and in particular the azer, might have more to report, should you wish to travel to the Elemental Plane of Fire and question them yourself.

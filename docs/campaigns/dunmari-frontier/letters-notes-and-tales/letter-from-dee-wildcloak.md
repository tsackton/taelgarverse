[The Green Leaf](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/the-green-leaf.md>) Inn, [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>)
  
Dear friends,

I hope this letter reaches you. The Sunmeadows tell me that you passed through here from [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>). I am leaving a copy with them, and also sending one on to [Wes Strongbones](<../../../people/halflings/wes-strongbones.md>) at the Red Lily in [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>). I am sure that if you are meant to read my words, you will find them somehow, in the way of things.

You caused quite a stir in [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>)! I was not sure who or what to believe, but after [Vola](<../../../people/chardonians/vola.md>) disappeared, something felt wrong, and I decided to get out. Dain thought me foolish - he is taking the money and going to [Illoria](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/illoria.md>), for [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>). But what can I say? Maybe I am too trusting, but if you can’t believe an elf, two dwarves, and a halfling, who can you believe? 

You should know there is a bounty on your head - enough for me to build that inn, but I am sure that I could not subdue you if I tried, even with stealth and trickery, so I will pass and seek my fortune elsewhere. It is officially sponsored by the [Society of the Open Scroll](<../../../groups/society-of-the-open-scroll.md>), but everyone knows it is really [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>). He really has it out for you. Maybe it’s because he is an evil scoundrel, as you hint. Or maybe its because those damn giant’s eyes are more valuable than anyone is letting on. I wish now we had never touched those things! But who know so much chaos would spin from a simple treasure hunting expedition. 

May our paths cross again in happy times!

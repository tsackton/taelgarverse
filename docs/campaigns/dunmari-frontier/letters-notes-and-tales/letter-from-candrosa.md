Dear friends,

I hope I may call you friends, although I fear my words did not go over as well as I hoped when we spoke last night. It is hard to know who to trust in these perilous times, and when four dangerous strangers appear in my town, for unclear reasons, it was easy to be suspicious. But I have prayed and prayed and despite the silence from Shakun I now believe your paths led to us in our moment of need because you have the skill and the generosity of spirit to aid us.

We on the eastern frontier of Dunmar live in a perilous place, but for generations the dangers lurking on our border have been misled and kept away by powerful enchantments. As we discussed, these enchantments are now fading, for reasons I do not understand. The danger is increasingly daily, and rumors are spreading.

Scouts are riding now to see what they can learn of the border and bring back information to help us separate truth from rumors. They are expected back in a few days, and will report to the village council when they return. I would like you all to be at that meeting, as your perspective and information will, I feel, be invaluable in our deliberations. I will send a messenger when we have news.

While we wait, I beg that you remain in town. I do not know if more attacks will come, but I will feel safer knowing there are those who can defend the people here should we be attacked. And please, in Shakun’s name, speak nothing of this to anyone else, until the council meeting.

Candrosa
Speaker of Shakun

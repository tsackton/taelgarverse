"I do not speak of my childhood lightly. I was born, chained. I suffered the rituals that bound me. If I think hard, I can still remember fire that burned through my veins. 

My tribe was slaughtered by the chief's father, Karguk. Not undeserved, for they, we I guess, had found [Xurkhaz](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) and raided for some time. When Karguk strode in battle against me -- I was still young -- I felt that quiet. I lay down my weapons, meek, and I followed Karguk back. 

He took me to the plaza, and he severed the chains. I took me a long time to walk to learn to walk again free.

And those fires still burn sometimes. But without the cloak, I could never have been free. All of our brethren, chained across the world, left to their fate when Cha'mutte's attempt to kill the gods failed, can never be free without the cloak. That is what it means to us."

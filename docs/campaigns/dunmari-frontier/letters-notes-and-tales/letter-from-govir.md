Dear friends,

Let us rejoice in the light of the Divine, and give thanks to [Laka](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/laka.md>) and his siblings for their continued guidance, and the [Bahrazel](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>) for their healing power. I still hear the echoes of their forges sometimes when I sleep, and it brings me great comfort, for they and their servant [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) banished the nightmares from my mind. 

I received your letter some months ago, asking after information about the rumored legendary cloak of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), the lost artifact that [Servius](<../../../people/chardonians/servius.md>) was searching for. It has taken some searching, but the new scribes [Ardan](<../../../people/dunmari/ardan.md>) has provided have been invaluable, and we are making progress with the [Archives](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>). When I heard the news that [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) was in [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), I hastily wrote this missive for you.

My breakthrough came in the records of the Aagiri, the [Aagir Mystai](<../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/aagir-mystai.md>). As you know, in these days they have no permanent home; they are an itinerant order of knights who protect our roads. But long ago, before the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the Aagiri maintained a series of fortified castles along the southeastern border of [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), protecting us from the dangers of the desolation of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>).

Not all the records of that order survived the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), but in our [Archives](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>) I found faded inventory book, from the days of Aatjami dynasty, hundreds of years before the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). I believe it describes the item you speak of. The text reads:

“The observations of Sonal, dedicat of [Aagir](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/aagir.md>), holy be his name and blessed be his warriors. By the grace of [Aagir](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/aagir.md>) we have won a great victory. The wraiths of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>) will not advance this day. We have brought sunlight to their dark places and scattered their meager treasures, but one item, of surpassing beauty, which we have claimed, for it seems too dangerous to leave on the empty plains for scavengers. A short cloak, a mantle, spun of thread of impossible color, vibrant reds and golds of the clouds at sunset, the deep blues of twilight, the yellow of the sun itself, swirling together to make all the colors of the rainbow. 

And yet, despite its beauty, the mantle of silence seems a thing of evil. For, when I wore the thing, I felt my power fade, [Aagir](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/aagir.md>) grow dim, my head clouded and full of doubt.”

A notation in the margin indicates that this mantle was locked in a vault in the fortress. Unfortunately, I can find only one other mention of this fortress. It is on a list of losses in the east to the deadly plague that spread during the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). No survivors. Whether anyone fled in secret with this mantle, I know not, but I suspect in my heart that it was lost when the plague swept over the fortress. There, perhaps, it still remains, unless scavengers in the desert have claimed it since. 

I hope this information aids you in these difficult times.

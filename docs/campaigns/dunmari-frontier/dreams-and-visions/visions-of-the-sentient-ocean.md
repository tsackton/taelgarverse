{title: Visions of the Sentient Ocean}
---




*A strange imagining, a water-filled dream. Faces - alien faces - forming in it, screaming, speaking but not in any language one could ever understand, for it is not a language of sound or sight but of the pull of the currents, the saltiness of the water, the subtle gradients of temperature and the throbbing of the weight of the ocean above, water around. Desperate flight, ripped from somewhere. A door, pulled open, a portal, following the tendrils of magic to a new place. A home. "We could not stay," the currents whisper. "We could not stay. The homewaters collapsed around us, the worldwaters were crushed. We fled. We were lucky to find this place."*

*The ocean turns to the party, questioning. You, Wellby, could have stayed, stayed in the Green Sea, stayed with family, with roadhomes and shiphomes. Yet you didn't? You, Delwath, could have stayed in treehomes, in feywanderings, could have not gone to war. Yet you didn't?"*

In the face of these visions, the ocean questions the party, pressing them, why did you leave your homes?

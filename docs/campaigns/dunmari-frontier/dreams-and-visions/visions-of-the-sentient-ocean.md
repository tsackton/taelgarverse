{title: Visions of the Sentient Ocean}
---




*A strange imagining, a water-filled dream. Faces - alien faces - forming in it, screaming, speaking but not in any language one could ever understand, for it is not a language of sound or sight but of the pull of the currents, the saltiness of the water, the subtle gradients of temperature and the throbbing of the weight of the ocean above, water around. Desperate flight, ripped from somewhere. A door, pulled open, a portal, following the tendrils of magic to a new place. A home. "We could not stay," the currents whisper. "We could not stay. The homewaters collapsed around us, the worldwaters were crushed. We fled. We were lucky to find this place."*

*The ocean turns to the party, questioning. You, Wellby, could have stayed, stayed in the Green Sea, stayed with family, with roadhomes and shiphomes. Yet you didn't? You, Delwath, could have stayed in treehomes, in feywanderings, could have not gone to war. Yet you didn't?"*

In the face of these visions, the ocean questions the party, pressing them, why did you leave your homes? 

Wellby says, or thinks or imagines, all those homes, the tidy, tight little ship cabins that he sailed in for years and years. The sound of the gulls over the water. The wagon homes a little vibe. you know, cabins along with the wagons filled with trade goods. but also thinks and says. beyond all of those this was my fault. and remembers thinking back to all the different times, with a map spread out on the table in front of him all the different map shops and map sellers, and the little book of maps that his family had in the sea charts. and over and over again, putting a finger down across all different ages, from a little young halfling to grown man on the blank places on the map and saying, What's there, what's there over and over again. and at last says that it took me a long time to realize it down to my bones. But that's where my home really is. The blank places on the map.



*Resonating with Delwath's sense of duty, the vision shifts again. 

### Challenge 2

**Scene:**
- A wave of emotions. Sadness; deep, eternal sadness, a low hum, a wail, a bitterness in the water, the metallic tang of despair. "Why did we not give up, when all had been lost? What was here for us?"
- A slow melody in the water, felt more as a soft whisper against your skin than sound. Colors grow. Life. Coral, fish, kelp, an abundance of life. Some of it mixing with the sentient ocean, growing, stretching, becoming merfolk.

The basic story is that the sentient ocean stayed because they found life, and especially because they accidentally created the merfolk, and then felt a duty, a need, to protect their creations. 

If answers to question 1 skew violence / danger: play up the conflict with the elemental plane of water. 
If answers skew curiosity: play up the strangeness of life, the novelty of it all, the weirdness

Improve if answers skew in some other way

**Questions:**

(what was a moment you might have decided that that was enough adventure, and retired, and yet didn't? what was the moment, and why didn't you retire?)

- Kenzo, you found a companion, a home perhaps, in Tollen, and yet you left to journey into danger and darkness. Why?
- Wellby, you were killed by Grash's blade, and could have stayed in the memory of your people, or taken on safer journeys, yet you came back from the River of Souls and have sought danger at every turn. Why?
- Delwath, you found the answers to the mysteries of your protector god, and found a people who would celebrate you for saving the tanshi, yet you left, and returned to danger. Why?
- Riswynn, you are twice renowned, among the dwarves for recovering the Chalice of the Runepriest, among the orcs for saving Xurkhaz, and none could doubt that you have served your duty tenfold. Yet you still venture into danger. Why?
- Seeker, you were offered a chance to join the ancient scholars of Tollen, to learn the answers to every mystery that might haunt you. And yet you said, not yet, and continue to travel into grave danger against your instincts. Why?

Requires 2 answers to succeed. 
### Challenge 3

**Scene:**
- This is the story of Buruli and Gazankoa and the jade.
- The merfolk tended the garden of names in Omi for many years, cultivating the secret. Gatza is related to this, the animals that eat the blooming bits of the garden. 

> The Garden of Names
> 	The garden of names is a hidden and sacred area within the kelp forest, where vibrant corals and bioluminescent kelp create an enchanting underwater landscape. Each piece of kelp and coral is inscribed with the name of a lost soul, written in an ancient merfolk script that glows faintly in the dim ocean light. These inscriptions are not merely decorative; they are integral to the magic of the garden.
> The Blooming Names
	 The names of the lost souls cause the kelp and coral to bloom in unique and intricate ways. Each name produces a distinct flower or growth, with colors and patterns that reflect the personality and life of the soul it represents. Some blooms might be luminescent, glowing softly in the dark waters, while others might emit gentle currents or soothing sounds. The flowers are not just beautiful; they are also imbued with the essence of the souls, creating a living memorial that is both visually stunning and deeply meaningful.
> The Whispering Garden
> 	The garden is also known for the whispers that emanate from the inscribed names. When the water is still, or during certain times of the day or phases of the moon, the names can be heard whispering. These whispers are believed to be the voices of the lost souls, sharing their thoughts, memories, and emotions. The whispers can be soft and comforting, or urgent and warning, depending on the mood and needs of the souls.

- The jade just makes it even more magical. 
- But the coming of the jade sparks jealousy in the heart of a merfolk warrior, Buruli. He wishes to control the power of the jade and does not listen to the whispers of the ocean.
- He learns the secret knowledge kept hidden, and offers sacrifices and promises to Gazankoa, an impossibly ancient monster of the deep, an elemental of the plane of water but so much more than that as well, an elder elemental, a kraken of the ancient days. 
- Hidden in the beauty of Omi, a rot began. The cult of Gazankoa grew, and Buruli's power grew. 
- Ten years ago, he struck, summoning a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water and opening Omi to attack. Many fled; many were hunted. 
- We wept and wept but could not leave Buruli free to wreck havoc across the oceans. Many of our precious children were sealed within, with their enemies. Whether they survive, as captives, or were killed, we cannot see. Now the way is sealed, and the rot cannot spread. But nor can it be healed until Buruli's power is taken from him. 

Again, steer towards what the players focus on: war, or plot mysteries, etc.

**Question:**

(how did you get here, specifically. what events led you to this path, to this place, to this quest?)

This is harder to target to a specific player, so maybe leave this a little more generic?
### Challenge 4

**Scene:** 
- This is the story of what happens next. Buruli destroyed, his power broken, the cult of Gazankoa disbanded. The garden restored. 
- Can include details of the Plane of Water politics, perhaps, or details of the alien minds of the sentient ocean and the merfolk, the stories of the next steps. Can improvise a bit. Maybe a vision of Omi restored. 

**Question:**

(What do you intend to do, to see this quest through, and after? How does your story end?)



Seeker reflects on his decision to stay with the group, believing his curiosity and contributions are essential for their success. The ocean begins to understand individuality and group loyalty as described by Seeker. It waits for further input, as the party's answers so far have been mixed.

Riswynn speaks of her need to repair and reconnect, inspired by her gods, always finding new tasks for mending. The ocean shows a vision of a partially destroyed city, resonating with Riswynn's theme of repair but retreats slightly in understanding. Delwath elaborates on his loyalty to his companions and their unique traits, explaining their collective bond.

Seeker recalls healing the sacred waters of [Kaikkea](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>), demonstrating their ability to cleanse and heal. Wellby remembers freeing a dolphin from a fishing net, demonstrating their instinct to help and protect. Kenzo reflects on his eagerness to learn and share the ocean's beauty, feeling a deep connection and desire to serve. Riswynn recounts fortifying a safe place for oppressed Orcs, highlighting her protective actions. Delwath thinks of the lost spirits of the Denoqua and the nightmare forests, expressing a desire to restore and protect them.
  
The ocean narrates a story of Buruli, Gazankoa, and the jade, describing a past war and the corruption it brought, asking how their story can end better. The party sees the ruined city of Omi below them, sensing they are close but not through the barrier yet. The ocean asks how their combined stories can lead to a better resolution.




Riswynn and Seeker discuss the warlock using the jade and the portal situation. The DM explains the ocean sealed the city to stop the warlock, who retreated to the plane of water. Delwath summarizes that the ocean can't risk attacking the warlock due to potential power loss. The DM confirms the need to travel to the plane of water to learn more.

Riswynn reflects on the sentient ocean's history, exile, and creation of merfolk. Seeker and the DM discuss the merfolk's hive-mind-like communication. Kenzo notes the jade's power balance, with three pieces against the warlock's one. Wellby questions the ocean's morality, recounting its colonization of Taelgar.

The DM explains the ocean's strategic retreat and stalemate with the warlock. Riswynn and Delwath debate the warlock's status in the plane of water versus a pocket dimension, and the risks of exposing the ocean. The DM confirms factions in the plane of water are against the ocean, but most don't care about Talgar.


Kenzo inquires about the open portal's reason, and the DM explains the warlock's need for an army. Wellby questions the necessity of closing the portal and implications of taking the jade. Delwath rephrases the goal to defeat the warlock and remove the jade. The DM confirms multiple possible resolutions, including taking the jade to close the portal.

[Session 14 (DuFr)](<../session-notes/session-14-dufr.md>)

You find yourself looking across a large, circular room, below a high domed roof, towards an open doorway. A small lizard-like winged creature, scales a faded purple trending to a pale white, like a threadbare purple robe stretched thin over frosted glass, stands before you. It paces slowly and laboriously back and forth, as if old and weary, and impatient. Three robed figures enter the room, and as you go to wave your hand in greeting you find you cannot move it. The winged creature leaps into the air, and as it flies towards the robed figures they kneel before you. For a brief moment as the dream fades, you see superimposed on the image of the room, another place, a vision of glowing, pulsing lights emanating from the robed figures, energy and thought intertwined in a delicate dance, as you slip into dreamless sleep.

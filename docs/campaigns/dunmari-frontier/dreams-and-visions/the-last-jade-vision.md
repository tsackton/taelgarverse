## The Last Jade Vision

As you drift off to sleep, you all find yourselves in a shared dream. The first thing you see is something you've seen before. You're standing on top of a high mountain pass, with this massive shadow dragon above you, and then Rai, like, everybody fighting. Beryl had a quarterstaff, and Aerin had some weird shadow dagger. Then, the moment when Cha'mutte dies—there's this silent flash that crosses the world, and suddenly you're yanked as Rai teleports to Drankor. You see what you haven't seen before: standing right outside this elaborate tomb, a structure where you gather Apollyon is buried, and there's a dagger flying towards the door. Rai grabs it in his hand moments before it strikes the door and stands there. 

Then time flashes forward, and you are in Rai's mind as he probes these bindings, trying to understand what he's grabbed onto. He reaches through the various tangles and twists and knots of Cha'mutte's magic and the essence of the plane of limbo, the plane of chaos that Cha'mutte was close to, woven in knots into a net that holds Apollyon in place.

This net wraps all the way around the tomb. It's woven tightly, but there are still small holes where something could pierce through and penetrate. Rai realizes that as long as the dagger is held, Apollyon has no power to do anything, and time passes. Apollyon seems to grow weaker every year in which he cannot feed on souls and cannot strengthen himself with his dagger.

Years pass, and the connection to the souls trapped in the dagger grows dimmer and dimmer until Rai decides standing here is maybe not the best place to be with the dagger so close. He teleports to the one area in Drankor that seems not cursed by the echoes of the plague and the dark energy of Apollyon and all of the many people who died there—a grand, huge domed building, a temple to the eight divines. Eight alcoves stretch out to create separate spaces for the eight gods to be worshipped around this giant central dome.

Many more years pass, and Apollyon seems to grow weaker and weaker. But this net of chaos, this fragment of Limbo wrapped around the temple, seems to grow stronger and stronger, with tendrils reaching out across the world. As Apollyon grows weaker and the chaos of limbo grows stronger, Rai decides that if he does nothing, the curse that Cha'mutte left behind may grow too strong. He leaves the dagger in what he thinks is the one place that will be safe—under the protection of the divine. Maybe it's still there, maybe it's not. And vanishes.

And the shared dream fades as you drift into peaceful sleep.

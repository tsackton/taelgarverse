title: The Shakun Mystai Initiation
---

The abbreviated initiation ritual experienced by Kenzo, Wellby, Drikod, Seeker, and Delwath is described [here](<../session-notes/session-26-dufr.md#the-initiation-ritual-of-the-shakun-mystai>).


>[!warning]- Kenzo and Drikod's Shakun Initiation Ritual
>
>As Kenzo and Drikod prepare for the initiation into the mysteries of Shakun, Candrosa spends time leading them in meditation and prayer, and also explaining the history of the initiation ceremony. He explains it will be a little bit strange, because you've already experienced some of it, having gone through this ritual before without the heart. But what is different is that now, the presence of the heart will be there to guide you. And things that didn't make sense may make more sense, he hopes.
> 
> The initiation itself is also the story of Shakun. Not exactly her history, but her power and her spirit and connection to Dunmar. And so, after a week of training and meditation and prayer, the the last evening before the feast of Bhishma, Candrosa takes you down through the Temple of Shakun, underground into this cavern where there's a pool of glowing water. The room, unlike the last time you were here, is brightly lit, and there is a warm glow that comes from the rock all around the the walls that surround this pool of water in the middle of this chamber, that just glowing sort of burnished red like the sunset, basically walked into a living sunset almost or sunrise. So everything is warm and bright. 
>
>Candrosa says, “This is the power of Shakun’s heart. With her here the mesa is alive. Bright and powerful, not dark.”
>
>As before he you change into the robes of the initiates, and Candrosa paints a crescent on your forehead with this red ochre pigment made from the mesa itself, which now also is glowing. You  feel almost as if you feel somebody, something, is wrapping its arm around your spirit, around your aura, and leading you to this pool of water. 
>
>As before, the surface of the pool bursts into flames of blue light. The acolyte leads you to the pool, gives you a drink of something, and submerges you underneath the flames.
>
>For a moment everything is darkness,  until your vision adjusts and you're looking down, lying over the land of Dunmar from west to east. Starting in the tumbled scrub land of rock and grass and low hills near the border of Chardon, along the outskirts of the mountains that are Drikod’s home, and then turning south along the river, passing across the plains and into the desert then turning west again to the Yuvanti Mountains. You fly upwards approaching the mountains,  soaring over the steep high peaks, and looking at the the savannas and the lush jungles beyond the mountains. 
>
>As you fly across this land you can feel yourself being being buoyed up by some presence. It and you are circling around the mesa, which is near the center of this land. As you circle the land becomes almost a blur of he plains and tall grasses and deserts. You drift higher and higher, until you hear a voice, maybe Candrosa’s, saying, “Look to the past.”
>
>The land changes. Now, before you you see a vast forest covering the entire land, huge trees stretching as far as the eye can see, the occasional sound of singing in a strange language dancing across the top of the trees. The voice says again, “this is what was here before.” The mesa is, in this time, not a mesa, but its presence is obvious. It is like a big open sinkhole, a sharp sided canyon with trees growing around and through it, with one enormous tree growing up from the bottom of the depression. 
>
>The voice speaks again: “And then evil came.” There's a flash of light, and you see fire in all directions, the forest burning, turning to ash. Everything is red with flame; you see nothing but the ash, the dead trees scattered across the land, the smell of death and blood. 
>
>The image slowly fades to to almost translucent, so you're looking at the same landscape but as shadowy realm. All you see is fire for a moment, there's no there's no visual image of anything other than fire marching across the land. Slowly, you see cities begin to spring up, still containing at their center a dim reflection of the fire that has faded. Then, from each city, a red ooze begins to bubble, spread across the land. Everything turns dark, and it looks almost as if there is acid spilling out across the landscape. Everything is being blackened, everything is being corroded and worn away. 
>
>The voice says again, “Until the land was land was cleansed.” You are pulled up into the sky., and then you feel yourself disjointed, falling as rain, flowing down onto this landscape, washing away this acid, life springing up behind you as you flow from the mountains down to the rivers into the sea. All of the ash. all of the blood, all of the fire,  all of the corrosion wash away with your passing. 
>
>The water now begins to pool at the center of the canyon that is, or will be, the mesa, and the voice continues, “But somebody had to protect the land that was left.” The mesa is starting to contract slightly, beginning to beat, starting from the pool of water formed in the canyon. As it beats, the land grows around it, with each beat stretching higher into the sky, until the mesa you recognize from today appears, the pool of water shrinking with each beat. 
>
>The voice again: “The land was and will be protected by the people who believe.” Your vision shifts, focusing on the pool that remains, the pool you recognize as Shakun’s Wellspring. Reflected in the water is an image: 
>
>Walking, turning a corner on a narrow track high in the mountains, seeing small trails of smoke rising in the distance from cook fires of a small village. And you can feel the anticipation of hearing again, the sounds of hammers against stone, the soft pattern young feet, running over stone, the background murmur of the life of this small village. As you walk up this path, approaching the village, you then see in this pool of water falling through the mountains through this stone---
>
>Emerging on an open plane, riding fast on a horse, your companion, a young boy riding beside you, both of you racing across the plains, laughing at how fast you're going. You look around at home as you arrive in camp, sitting down as the sun sets, talking to your family, acknowledging the land that supports you, that protects you that provides for you. And then watching as the sun sets---
>
>Into the night sky full of stars, clear and bright. And a sense of calm then washes over you as for a moment you feel the sense of profound peace and everything slows. 
>
>Your vision returns to this pool of water. You can see the lines of energy that are starting to run out from this pool. They start to gather, start to pull themselves together, start to form this fibrous mass in the center of the mesa. It’s somehow your energy, your connection, your feelings of peace and happiness and the echoes of the land of your home that are also somehow pulled into this fibrous mass that's growing and forming into stone. You begin to see Shakun forming around stone. She takes it, she reaches into her translucent body and pulls out the heart, and lays down. As she does you can see the mesa grow around her, and as she places the heart down it grows bigger and bigger. The web of power has coalesced into the Shakun’s heart, and the mesa springs up with this light that is illuminating the cavern. You are bathed in a warm reddish glow that washes across Dunmar. 
>
>The voice says again, echoing with the voices of many, “We will protect this land together.” You can feel the energy now flowing back and forth between you, the heart, and  everybody else who you sense now who is part of the Mystai of Shakun and this network that protects Dunmar. You can feel the ebb and flow of energy with each beat of this heart, now in its place in the temple here. 
>
>As your eyes snap open, standing in blue fire of this water, you can see now in the pool around you the images that you've seen once before: the village track in the mountains, running across the plains, the starry night, and then many, many others, camps, tending horses, praying, a particularly delicious meal, snuggling with your parents, just images and images and images of what you realize must be the memories of the moments of peace and happiness of all the other Mystai that you are now connected to.

>And then Candrosa nods to you, saying “Welcome, my friends.”

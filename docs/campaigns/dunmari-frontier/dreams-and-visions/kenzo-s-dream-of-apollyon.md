{title: Kenzo's Dream of Apollyon}
---
A recurring dream of Apollyon that Kenzo has had, since the beginning of May, 1749. Every other night, or so, the chains dissolve more and more. 

*You standing on a wide empty street, sickly vines clinging to the marble facades of the empty shells of buildings. All is dark, the moon obscured, the only noise a faint rhythmic scraping, the sound of metal dragged over stone. Slowly, you find yourself walking towards the noise, your feet not your own, unable to stop. As you walk, the noise grows louder, insistent - a long scrap, and then a sharp thud, in time with your heartbeat. Your feet draw you closer; you feel the vibrations echoing in your chest now, until you find yourself standing before a massive tomb complex, its huge stone doors wrapped in chains. With a start, you notice the door shakes with each thud.*

*Scraapppp, thud. Scraaappp thud, until suddenly there is a loud crack, the air itself vibrating and the door shaking. There is quiet for a moment, then a soft drip drip drip. Your feet are rooting in place, unable to move, your gaze drawn upward. Blood is running down the wall of the mausoleum, dripping onto the chains that bind the door. As each drop of blood falls on the binding chains, you can hear a faint scream of terror, and the hissing sound of acid eating away at metal. Slowly, but inexorably, the burning blood begins to dissolve the chains.*

*You jolt awake in the darkness as the sounds of dry, hoarse laughter echo and fade in your dream.*

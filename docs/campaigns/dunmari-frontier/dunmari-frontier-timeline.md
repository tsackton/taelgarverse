Return to Kirian's, where Amay, a captain of the Dunmari army is waiting to escort them to camp. Attempt to scry, but are detected. Go with Amay. Arrive at commander Illyan's tent, learn they must leave all magic behind to speak with him, enforced by Drusa, a Chardonian mage. Refuse, but agree to send Kenzo in.

Fight statues, then explore underground lair of Fraternity of the Empty Moon. Kill 10 werewolves, including the leader, and rescue Govir. Find the dead body of Hada, the head scribe, killed apparently by Govir while in a lycanthropic rage. While searching the bodies, more werewolves attack.

Search the lair, finding notes and clues, and other treasures, and also a poison gas trap that Wellby sets off while exploring a secret room with Riswynn.

Interrogate captives. One is violent and unwilling to speak; the other is a Dunmari refugee who was turned and wants to be cured. With the aid of Seeker's magic, the party forces the unwilling one to speak, who reveals the whole story of the werewolves' trade with [Agata](<../../people/fey/agata.md>) and plotting to return to Tokra.

title: Alchemical Teakettle
---


A black iron teakettle that appears to be able to hold about a gallon of liquid, and weighs 12 pounds. Probably a dwarven creation. Found in [Agata's lair](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/agata-s-lair.md>). 

## Mechanics

As an action, you can name one liquid from the table below to cause the teakettle to produce the chosen liquid. By tipping the kettle you can cause the liquid to pour out, at up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid produced depends on the type. Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it cannot produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn. 

| Liquid       | Max Amount |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Acid (\*)        | 8 ounces   |
| Basic Poison (\*\*) | 1/2 ounce  |
| Beer         | 4 gallons  |
| Honey        | 1 gallon   |
| Oil          | 1 quart    |
| Tea          | 4 gallons  |
| Vinegar      | 2 gallons  |
| Water, fresh | 8 gallons  |
| Water, boiling  | 4 gallons |
| Wine         | 1 gallon   |
<sub>(\*) As an action, you can splash acid onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw a vial of acid up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes **2d6** acid damage.</sub>
<sub>(\*\*) You can use the poison to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take **1d4** poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</sub>

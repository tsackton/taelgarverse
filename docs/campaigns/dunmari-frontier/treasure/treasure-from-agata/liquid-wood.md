(destroyed)

The exact mechanics would require further study to understand, but there are a few pieces you glean.
-  Activating the process requires expending a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, and also requires blood from the intended victim to be mixed into the goo. Thus, this magic only works on creatures that have blood.
-  The enchantment is temporary, slowing fading over the course of a week, unless the transformation is locked in place by binding a piece of hair, tooth, bone, skin, or some other physical token into a wooden carving of the victim, and painting that with liquid wood as well. If this is done, at the end of the week, the enchantment is made permanent and can only be broken by Dispel Magic targeting a 6th level spell, or Remove Curse cast at 5th level or higher.
-  When the enchantment is made permanent, the victim can also be commanded by their creator; everything the creator speaks to the victim has the effect of the Suggestion spell.Â

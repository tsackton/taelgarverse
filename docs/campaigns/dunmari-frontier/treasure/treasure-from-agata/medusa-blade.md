>> 

A cursed sword taken from [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)'s lair. Grants the bearer the power to turn those they strike to stone, but will turn on the bearer as well, if given the chance. 

Destroyed by the Baharzel at Riswynn's request, freeing [Havdar](<../../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) of its curse.

title: Message Stone
---


These message stones are of Drankorian origin. Taken from [Samerki](<../../../../people/other-nonhumans/samerki.md>) and [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>). Have a known range of at least 100 miles, but do not work across interplanar boundaries. Can be used for 5 minutes per day.

Each message stone comes paired to one or more other stones, and allow one to speak as if one were at the location of the paired stone. 

[Kenzo](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) and [Wellby](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) have a paired set.

title: Ring of the Warded Mind
---

[Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/3710482-ring-of-the-warded-mind). 

A dull silver ring that radiates abjuration magic, that seems hard to focus on. Dwarven in origin according to [Seeker](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>). Taken from [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s person. 

Supposedly contained the soul of [Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>), a native of the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>) who was once the guardian of a tree that contains the essence of all trees, and left to hunt down [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>). 



#### Typhina's Story

[Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) tells you she was once the guardian of an ancient tree in the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), a tree that was the essence of wood itself. [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>), when she was banished from the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), stole a branch of this tree, and [Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) was sent to retrieve it. She failed, and [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>) killed her, but, she says, [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>) did not know of the power of her ring. When she died, her soul was preserved in this ring, and now she is seeking a way to return to the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), where she believes she can be reborn. The ring itself, she says, was the gift of a Dwarven scholar, [Daruk](<../../../../people/dwarves/daruk.md>), who traveled to the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>) many years ago, seeking to understand the elemental essence of living things. 

Actually, however, "[Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>)" was [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>) in disguise, the real [Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) having been killed by [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>) in the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>) realm of [Amberglow](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>) long ago. Unclear where the ring came from.

[Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/3819589-black-light-candle). 

A candle made of gray wax, radiating evocation magic. Very likely of fey origin. Taken from [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)â€™s hut. Sold as part of the deal to get the [Chalice of the Runepriest](<../../../../things/artifacts-of-power/chalice-of-the-runepriest.md>) back, in [Session 49 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-49-dufr.md>).

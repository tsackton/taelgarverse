title: Ever Spinning Top

[Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/3819604-always-spinning-top) 
  
A small metal top that spins continuously while it is being observed. Radiates divination magic. Probably of Drankorian origin. Taken from [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s hut. Carried by [Wellby](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) until taken by [Kadmos](<../../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) in [Session 44 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-44-dufr.md>). 

Probably designed not just as a toy, but as a way to detect scrying.

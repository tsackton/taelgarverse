title: Thorn Seed Bag
---

A greenish bag that smells of rot and decay, radiates transmutation magic. It contains three seeds. If a seed is planted in the ground, over the course of the next two weeks all plant life within 300 feet withers and rots, and the land becomes cursed. While the land is cursed, no plants can grow. Alternatively, a seed can be thrown up to 60 feet. This has the effect of the spike growth spell centered on the point of impact. Probably a creation of [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s. Taken from [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)’s hut. 

Destroyed in [Session 31 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-31-dufr.md>).

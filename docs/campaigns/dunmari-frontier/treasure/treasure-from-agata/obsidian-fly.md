title: Obsidian Fly
---

A small black obsidian fly. Can speak a command word to summon the fly, and whomever summons it can speak the same word to turn it back into a figurine. Will attack anyone who summons it who is not its master, and cannot take a new master until its old master is dead. 

It is not clear the origin of this item. Taken from [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)â€™s person. Fed to a giant worm under a monastery, but recovered. Kind of an asshole. 

Learned from [Arryn](<../../../../people/other-humans/arryn.md>), the mirror wizard at the edge of the ~Eastern Ocean~ 1 that it cannot serve a new master until its old master is dead.

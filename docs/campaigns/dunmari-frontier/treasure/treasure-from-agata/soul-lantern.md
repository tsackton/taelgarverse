title: Soul Lantern
---

This hooded lantern seems to constantly murmur and moan in a strange language just faint enough to not be clearly heard, and radiates necromancy magic. 

Seen in [The Mirror of the Past](<../treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/the-mirror-of-the-past.md>): [Soul Lantern Vision](<../../mirror-visions/soul-lantern-vision.md>)

When attuned to this lantern, you can use an action to trap the soul of a creature that has died within the past minute. The lantern can store up to six souls at a time. When the lantern has at least one soul trapped within, you can call on a trapped soul, using its energy to cast one of the following spells: mage hand (1 charge), hex (1 charge), bestow curse (3 charges), spirit shroud (3 charges), summon undead (3 charges), or eyebite (6 charges). 

Each soul trapped by the lantern can be used to fuel up to 6 charges worth of magic, after which it is ripped to shreds and ceases to exist. Taken from [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)â€™s hut. 

Destroyed by [Cintra](<../../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>) during the [Feast of Bhishma](<../../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/feast-of-bhishma.md>) in [Session 32 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-32-dufr.md>).

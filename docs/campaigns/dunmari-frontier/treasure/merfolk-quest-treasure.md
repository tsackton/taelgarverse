{title: Merfolk Quest Treasure}
---
## Treasure Acquired in [Apporia](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>) 

- 6 potions of transformation, plus 6 doses of antidote. The potions of transformation are literally that, transformations. While under the effects, you gain gills but lose lungs. You can now breath water, but not air. Have no effect on swim speed, and last until the antidote is taken or the magical transformation is dispelled. A gift from [Kazuro](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/kazuro.md>) in exchange for a [promise to return and help him build a monastery and find a student](<../session-notes/session-99-dufr.md>).
## Treasure Acquired in Omi

- A large (10 foot long) trident, taken from the herald of Gazankoa protecting the portal in Omi. Abandoned in the temple of Gazankoa during the merfolk fight (unless someone can give a logical explanation for how someone could have got this across the rainbow bridge without the manta rays). 
## Treasure Acquired in Buruli's Kingdom

- A small humming piece of metal, which sounds like the ocean, found connected to the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<notable-items/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>) inside a shell in Buruli's temple to Gazankoa. 
- 17 amulets of Gazankoa. Each amulet has a pearl in the center, with eight tentacles curling off in a spiral pattern. They are made of a variety of materials: 6 of shell, 7 of some kind of resin, 3 of ivory, and 1 of silver. Taken from various merfolk guards. 
- 241 small pieces of coral, smoothed and marked with signs, that look like currency of some kind. Taken from various merfolk guards. 
- 112 silver Chardonian coins 
- 14 dwarven gold coins
- 109 Dunmari silver coins
- 93 strange silver coins of a design you have never seen, with a small hole in the center and strange writing around the edge. 
- A set of bone dice, merfolk made 
- 63 merfolk gambling tokens, made of polished shell and stone. 
### Recovered Treasure from the [Stormdancer](<../../../things/ships/stormdancer.md>)

Presumably all returned to Milo, Tilly, and crew, unless you say otherwise.

- An elegant wooden pipe, made of some strange dark wood you have not seen before, carved with the initials M. T. 
- A silver ring set with a small blue sapphire, engraved, "To my beloved Tilly" on the inside. 
- A beautifully crafted brass compass, casing engraved with "Stormdancer". It does not work anymore. 
- A magic silver rapier, owned by Milo and returned to him.
- A strange swirling silvery crystal on a necklace, returned to Tilly. 
## From Buruli's Body

TBD....maybe you should search him next session

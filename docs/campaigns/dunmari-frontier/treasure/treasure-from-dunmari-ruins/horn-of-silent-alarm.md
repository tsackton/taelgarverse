# Horn of Silent Alarm
>[!info]+ Item Info
> [(common magical horn)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/horn-of-silent-alarm)



The party currently has one of these, apparently a fairly common Dunmari magic item.

One, carried by [Delwath](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), [was taken](<../../session-notes/session-45-dufr.md>) from [Justan](<../../../../people/dunmari/justan.md>), a perhaps-reformed Dunmari bandit, after he and his companions were cruelly murdered by [dastardly](<../../../../people/chardonians/casian.md>) [Chardonians](<../../../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>).

A second, once carried by [Kenzo](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), [was found](<../../session-notes/session-3-dufr.md>) in the ruined Dunmari [fort](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dunmari-fort-gomat.md>) east of the [Gomat](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/gomat.md>) oasis, on the body of Dunmari scout who apparently died more than a hundred years ago. This horn has an etched running horse design. It was [sacrificed](<../../session-notes/session-69-dufr.md>) as part of the ritual to free [Kenzo](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) from the cursed soul chain that [he acquired](<../../session-notes/session-57-dufr.md>) while freeing [Motua](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/motua.md>).

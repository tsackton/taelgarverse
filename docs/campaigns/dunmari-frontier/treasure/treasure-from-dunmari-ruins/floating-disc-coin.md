A small golden coin, unusually heavy for its size, and without a recognizable mark. 

Found near the petrified form of [Arcus](<../../../../people/chardonians/arcus.md>) in the fort east of [Gomat](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/gomat.md>). 

Viewed in [The Mirror of the Past](<../treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/the-mirror-of-the-past.md>): [Floating Disc Coin Vision](<../../mirror-visions/floating-disc-coin-vision.md>).

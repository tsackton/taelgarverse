An elven sword, finely made and carved with Elvish script warding against demons. Glows faintly blue when fiends are within 120’ feet, and allows the attuned user to speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal. Does an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit. Against fiends, does an extra 3d8 radiant damage on a hit instead. Has one charge (regains at dawn) that can be used to cast either dispel good and evil or magic circle (as a 5th level spell), in both cases only targeting fiends. Fiends can sense the presence of the sword and will always be hostile to the bearer. Found in [Grimbaskal](<../../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>)’s hoard.

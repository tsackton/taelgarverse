title: Magic Cooking Pouch
---
(minor item, uncommon)

Acquired by Delwath in the Te'kula village in the Elderwood, from an unknown origin. 

This small pouch is about the size of a large coin purse but is stitched with motifs of plants, animals, and spices. When open, it gives off an aroma of freshly cooked food, which varies each time it is opened: a stew one day, frying onions the next, baking bread, and so on. This pouch has three magic abilities:

* It has 3 charges, regained each evening when the sun sets. Using a charge allows the bearer to draw forth a pinch or two of any spice, enough to flavor one meal, which can feed up to 8 people. Anyone who consumes this meal during a short rest regains an additional 2 hit points per hit die they expend. 

* Meals cooked with the aid of this pouch are unusually tasty and interesting. Anyone using this pouch to cook is considered proficient in cook's utensils, unless they are already proficient, in which case they can add add twice their proficiency bonus to any roll involving cook's utensils.  

* Within the extra-dimensional space, it has storage for up to 10 pounds of once living material. Anything kept in this space will not spoil, rot, or go bad.

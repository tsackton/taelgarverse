(rare major item, requires attunement by a wizard)

A spellbook of the form of a collection of tanshi stories and prayers. When attuned by a wizard, functions as spellbook, can be used as an arcane focus. It contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to it: [augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/augury), [divination](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/divination), [find the path](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-the-path), [foresight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/foresight), [locate creature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/locate-creature), and [locate object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/locate-object). The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the archive, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the archive. The new spell must be of the divination school.
- When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and force the creature to roll a d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the original roll. You can do this after you see the roll but before its effects are applied. 

Note: while the effects are the same as the linked ‘Astromany Archive’, the description on  D&D Beyond is incorrect. Found in [Grimbaskal](<../../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>)’s hoard.

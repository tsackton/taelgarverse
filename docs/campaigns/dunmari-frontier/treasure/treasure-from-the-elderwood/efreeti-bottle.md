[Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4629-efreeti-bottle)

This iron stoppered bottle is covered in runes of elemental fire, and contains an efreeti. When you open the bottle, the efreeti is released. It may attack you, it may obey your commands for 1 hour, or it may grant you a single casting of the Wish spell. If the efreeti attacks, it disappears after 5 rounds or when killed. If the efreeti grants a Wish, it vanishes after the magic is complete. If the efreeti obeys your commands, it returns to the bottle after 1 hour, and may be summoned twice more before vanishing (each subsequent time it is summoned, it will obey your commands for 1 hour). Found in [Grimbaskal](<../../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>)â€™s hoard.

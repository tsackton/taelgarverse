title: Glove of Crystalized Magic
---


A glove constructed by [Seeker](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) in [Shimmersong](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>), from shards of crystalized magic gifted to [Seeker](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) by [Illaran](<../../../../people/fey/illaran.md>). These shards allow you to manipulate magic as you cast spells, currently either by changing the range of spells, or by shifting the elemental effects of a spell. 

Improved by [Faldrak](<../../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) at the Elemental Forge. 

## Mechanics

While you wear and are attuned to this glove, you have 5 charges you can use when you cast a spell to modify the magic of the spell itself, changing the casting. The glove currently holds three crystals:

*Crystal of Space*. You can manipulate the range of your spells. When you cast a spell with a range of touch, you can expend 1 charge to make the range of the spell 30 feet. When you cast a spell with a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 charge to double the range. You can spend as many charges as you have remaining on this effect, applying each in turn. However, if you spend 2 or more charges on the same spell, you must roll an ability check using your Spellcasting modifier, against a DC of 8 + twice the charges expended. On a failure, you trigger an unpredictable effect.

*Crystal of Elements*. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can draw on the power of the crystal to imbue your casting with elemental energy. You can change the appearance and damage of any spell, converting it to one of the following elemental types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. 

You can also choose to expend charges to imbue your casting with an elemental effect. If you expend 1 charge, choose an option on the following table:


| Element | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fire    | A glowing ball of fire bursts into flame in your hands. Make a spell attack roll against one target of the spell, or another creature you can see within 30 feet . On a hit, the target takes 2d10 fire damage. If there are no available targets, or if your attack roll misses, you take 2d10 fire damage.                                       |
| Air     | You gain a fly speed of 60 feet and the ability to Dash as a Bonus Action until the end of your turn. If you use your Bonus Action to Dash, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you fall, landing prone and taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet of distance you fall.                                       |
| Water   | You create a wave of water that bursts out from you in a 10-foot radius. Each creature of your choice that you can see in that area takes 2d6 cold damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you and fall prone. The area is difficult terrain until the end of your next turn. |
| Earth   | A thin crust of earth and stone encases you. Until the start of your next turn, your speed is reduced to 0 and you gain resistance to one type of damage of your choice.                                                                                                                                                                           |


*Crystal of Animation.* You can use the magic of the glove to enhance your creations. 

- When you use your Performance of Creation to create a small or tiny object, you can expend 3 charges to imbue the item you create with limited sentience and mobility. The object gains the ability to understand you and communicate using limited speech and writing, a move of 30 feet, 60 foot darkvision, and your choice of either a swim speed, climb speed, or fly speed equal to its move. It has Hit Points equal to your bard level, uses your saving throws if needed, and is proficient in Stealth and Perception. It obeys your commands to the best of its ability. 

- When you use your Animating Performance, you can imbue the animated object with elemental energy by expending 3 charges. Choose one of the following effects:

| Element | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fire    | The animated object glows with inner fire. A creature that touches the construct or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1d10 fire damage.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Air     | The animated object is nimble and difficult to hit. It’s movement speed and fly speed increase by 10 feet each, and neither the animated object nor anyone riding it provoke opportunity attacks when leaving an enemies’ reach.                                                                                                           |
| Water   | The animated object gains the following reaction: When the animated object takes damage, it makes a slam attack against a random enemy within 5 feet of it. If no creature is within reach, it can move up to half its speed toward an enemy it can see, without provoking opportunity attacks.                        |
| Earth   | The animated object gains the following bonus action: While the object is within 5 feet of an ally, they can hurl the ally 5 × PB feet in any direction, including up. If the ally would normally take damage from a fall after being thrown, they can negate the damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. |

Can, according to [Seeker](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s identity spell, somehow “bring the plane of [Pandemonium](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/primal-realms/pandemonium.md>) closer to Taelgar”. Taken from [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>) lair. Runes wiggle and squirm when trying to look at them, and caused mild nausea and confusion.

Looked at in [The Mirror of the Past](<../treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/the-mirror-of-the-past.md>): [Pandemonium Scroll Vision](<../../mirror-visions/pandemonium-scroll-vision.md>)

Traded to [Fausto](<../../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) as part of the deal for [Hralgar's Eyes](<../treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/hralgar-s-eyes.md>). Kept by [Fausto](<../../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) when he betrayed the party.

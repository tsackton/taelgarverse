title: Dunmari Map of Pandemonium Ruins
---

A map of the ruins of the Pandemonium fort, created by the Dunmari during [Exile of Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../../../events/1600s/exile-of-fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>). Contains notes on the secret paths to avoid the effects of [Pandemonium](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/primal-realms/pandemonium.md>) while approaching.

Found in the [Tokra](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) [Archives](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>) by [Govir](<../../../../people/dunmari/govir.md>), which led to his kidnapping and infection with lycanthropy.

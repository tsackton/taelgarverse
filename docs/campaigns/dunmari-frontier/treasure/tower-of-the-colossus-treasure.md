## Treasure from the Tower of the Colossus

- A [manual of stone golems](<notable-items/taurion-s-manual-of-golems.md>), found in the basement storeroom guarded by a stone golem.
- Material for making spell scrolls, containing enough inks and special paper to produce 4 scrolls: 3 up to 3rd level, and 1 up to 5th level. Each scroll requires 8 hours of work to produce, with the kit
- Four spell scrolls: Sending, Private Sanctum, Reverse Gravity, and Passwall
- Six magical lenses of a variety of sizes, once apparently part of a telepscope. 
- A collection of about 150 scrolls, highly fragile and prone to disintegration if handled. A sampling of six scrolls revealed poems and plays, in Drankorian and Elvish. All but one particularly sturdy one left behind in the tower. 
- Copies of five scrolls read in the tower, but not brought along for risk of disintegration.

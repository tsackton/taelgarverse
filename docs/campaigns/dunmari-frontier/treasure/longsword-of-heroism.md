This longsword is elegantly designed with the crest of the [Dharajun Dynasty](<../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/dharajun-dynasty.md>) engraved on the hilt. It was found, broken, by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) in the ruins of the palace in[Kharsan](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>), and repaired by [Riswynn](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) and [Kethra](<../../../people/dwarves/kethra.md>).

A pair of soft boots made of dark brown leather, which radiate illusion magic. Dunmari in origin. Can be used to change your footprints into any humanoid creature you desire. 


Originally possessed and used by [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>). Taken from her by [Wellby](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) when [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) killed [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) on May 29, 1748. Later given to Marcella, to aid her escape from Kadmos and company, on July 23, 1748.

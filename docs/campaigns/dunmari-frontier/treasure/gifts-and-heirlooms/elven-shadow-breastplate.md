### Elven Shadow Breastplate

[Delwath](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s old battle armor from his time as a quartermaster in the elven armies during the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), transformed and infused with the magic of the shadow plane, an embodied fragment of which is now embedded in the center of the armor. 

Found on [Delwath](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) when [Pava](<../../../../people/dunmari/pava.md>) and [Avaras](<../../../../people/dunmari/avaras.md>) recovered him in the desert, and returned to him in [Session 20 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-20-dufr.md>).

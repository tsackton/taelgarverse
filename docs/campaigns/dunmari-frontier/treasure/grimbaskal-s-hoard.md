# Grimbaskal's Hoard

Treasure found in the lair of the green dragon [Grimbaskal](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>), in the [Elderwood](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>).

[Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5346718-saddle-of-the-bonded-companion) A magical saddle that protects a mount, made of nice leather and decorated with fine silver work, of halfling make. Found in [Grimbaskal](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>)’s hoard. Worn by [Baxter](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/companions/baxter.md>). 
- [Kenku Glamoured Armor](<notable-items/kenku-glamoured-armor.md>) (very rare major item)
- Wand of Detect Magic (uncommon minor item)
- Efreeti Bottle (very rare major item, party) 
- [Augury Mirrors](<notable-items/augury-mirrors.md>) (rare minor item, party)
- [Deno’qai Eagle Shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5346731-denoqai-eagle-shield) (give to [Theba](<../../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>)): A enchanted wooden shield, brightly painted and carved with an eagle motif. While attuned, can cast animal messenger (at 3rd level) at will, but only targeted the eagle motif (so need to wait for it to return to cast again). The eagle messenger can travel up to 5 miles an hour, and can pass through obstacles. 
- [Deno’qai Lightning Spear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5346735-denoqai-lightning-spear) (give to [Theba](<../../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>)): A spear decorated with lightning motifs. Functions as a +1 spear, with 60 foot short range and no long range. Has 3 charges, which it regains each day at dawn. Can use 3 charges to cause the spear to turn into a lightning bolt as you hurl it, which has the effect of casting the lightning bolt spell but with a range of 60' instead of the normal range of the spell. If you hurl it at a target, make an attack roll against the target as normal: on a hit, they take the normal spear damage and have disadvantage on the lightning bolt saving throw. You can also expend 1 charge to do an extra 2d6 lightning damage on a hit. (Spell Save DC is equal to your 8 + ability score used for the attack roll + proficiency) 
- Arcane Grimoire. A spellbook of the form of a collection of tanshi stories and prayers. [Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2400685-astromancy-archive).

## Mundane Treasures

- A longsword in a black leather scabbard, with white gems in the pommel, with a matching sword belt in black leather. It closes with a silver buckle in the form of a screaming eagle, a small moonstone as its eye 
- Three well-made hats. Halfling make, in surprisingly good shape and expertly tailored   
- A set of wind chimes  
-  A tapestry depicted a lush, wild rose garden, tangled and vibrant, probably of Elven make  
- A tapestry of trees in bloom, in front of a mountain, in an unusual and hard to recognize style, probably from far away 
- Carved bone statuette of an eagle  
- The polished skull of a unicorn, latticed with luminescent blooms, and seemingly a minor enchantment to keep the flowers alive 
- A life-sized wooden statute of an owl, carved from a single piece of wood, deep red in color, with gems for eyes and silver highlights on the feathers and talons 
- A harp, its pillar carved to represent a beautiful elf 
- A richly detailed, beautifully made painting of an ancient elven forest, of Elven make  
- A giant-sized hunting horn carved from a mammoth tusk and scrimshawed with elaborate patterns   
- A large carved wooden statue of a dragon, painted in vivid greens and with two emeralds for eyes. Weighs at least 2000 pounds, if not more. Would be worth at least 5000 gp to the right buyer, but transport is a major issue. About 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall. 
- A stuffed owlbear. Weighs at least 1000 pounds, and is big and awkward. Might be worth something to a collector, but impossible ot value. Roughly 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet in size.  
- Eight bolts of silk. Four are plain white silk (20 - 50 gp each), two are fine silk dyed a rich purple (100 - 250 gp each), and two are beautifully dyed with a complex pattern (100 - 600 gp each) 
- A large number of logs, in a range of lengths from just larger than an arm in length and breadth up to the breadth of a [human](<../../../species/children-of-divine-creation/humans/humans.md>)’s body and ten paces in length. Each log has been carefully cut and polished so as to display the beauty of its grain and remove any danger of splinters. Many of the logs are hardy and rare hard woods of considerable value. Even the less valuable logs would still be useful to any master carpenter or lesser workman (32 logs total, most would sell for 15 - 150 gp, but two exquisite and rare hardwood logs would sell for 300-400 gp).  
- A large wooden spice chest (Grimbaskal's Hoard). Contains 20 pounds of salt (60 gp), 2 pounds of saffron (70 gp), 10 pounds of cinnamon (150 gp), 10 pounds of cloves (150 gp), 5 pounds of allspice (60 gp), 5 pounds of peppercorn (75 gp), and a set of silver weights, measures, and grinding implements (25 gp).

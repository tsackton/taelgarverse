A gift from [Basu](<../../../../people/dunmari/basu.md>), in exchange for helping clear the excess extraplanar energy from the [Elven Arborea Workshop](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/elven-arborea-workshop.md>) beneath the [Lakan Monastery](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/lakan-monastery.md>), permeated with the essence of [Arborea](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/primal-realms/arborea.md>). 

Received in [Session 42 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-42-dufr.md>), from [Basu](<../../../../people/dunmari/basu.md>), with four rules:
1) never open an extradimensional portal instead another extradimensional portal; 
2) no fire (or acid, or similar effects) in the hole, because eventually the silk of the cloth itself will burn and the item will be destroyed; 
3) be careful which direction you open it – if you put it on the ceiling everything will fall out; and 
4) don’t rip the material from the outside or especially from the inside, as any tear can rip apart and eject everything inside into a random other plane.

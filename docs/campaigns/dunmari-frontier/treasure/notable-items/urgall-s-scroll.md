# Urgall's Scroll
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Skaer](<../../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/skaerhem.md>) Ciphered Scroll**  

A ciphered scroll, recovered from the captain's cabin on the [Flaming Tempest](<../../../../things/ships/flaming-tempest.md>), in the hand of [Urgall the Black](<../../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>). It reads, in translation:

>The words of [Mashtu the Corruptor](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/mashtu-the-corruptor.md>), who has given me power over the ocean, recorded here in secret least I forget my purpose. 
>
>[Urgall](<../../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>), the voice said. You will go to the sacred places on these seas: the holy wells of Parmo, the sacred waters of [Vetta](<../../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/vetta.md>), the waters beneath Quanyi, the ancient temple among the ruins of Nkasa, the blessed springs of Beresa, and the sunken garden of Inulvis.
>
>Six times you will summon me, and six times I will come to corrupt the ancient waters. 
>
>Six times you will be bathed in my power, and six times you will emerge stronger.
>
>Once you have done this, you will control the very sea itself, from east to west, as far as water can flow.

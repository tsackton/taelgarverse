These are a pair of goggles, with lenses made of polished purple gems, that are designed to allow the detailed study of objects. 


This pair was [found](<../../session-notes/session-16-dufr.md>) by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) in [Stormcaller Tower](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>) and is now carried by [Seeker](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>).

# The Soul Lantern
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **Magical Lantern**  

This hooded lantern seems to constantly murmur and moan in a strange language just faint enough to not be clearly heard, and radiates necromancy magic. 

Seen in [Mirror of the Past](<./mirror-of-the-past.md>): [Soul Lantern Vision](<../../mirror-visions/soul-lantern-vision.md>)



Taken from [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)â€™s hut. 

Destroyed by [Cintra](<../../../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>) during the [Feast of Bhishma](<../../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/feast-of-bhishma.md>) in [Session 32 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-32-dufr.md>).

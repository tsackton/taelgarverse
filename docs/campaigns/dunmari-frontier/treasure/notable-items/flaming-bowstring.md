This Dunmari bowstring is made of a fine silk thread, enchanted and blessed by [Aagir](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/aagir.md>). The magic of the thread means it can be attached to any bow or crossbow, and will grow or shrink as needed to fit. 

Originally the weapon of [Camana](<../../../../people/dunmari/camana.md>), the leader of [Havdar](<../../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>)'s scouts, who died in battle against the [orcs](<../../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) of [Grash's Horde](<../../../../groups/orc-hordes/grash-s-horde.md>), in the [Nashtkar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>). After the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) [aided](<../../session-notes/session-20-dufr.md>) [Havdar](<../../../../people/dunmari/havdar.md>) in battle, was [gifted](<../../session-notes/session-21-dufr.md>)to [Wellby](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>).

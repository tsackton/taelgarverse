# The Staff of the Forest Soul
>[!info]+ Information
> (unique magical staff)
>> 

This staff was constructed by [Kenzo](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) from a branch of the ancient elven tree in [Tokra](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), a relative of the massive trees called God trees by the Deno’qai of the [Elderwood](<../../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>). This staff is a +1 magic quarterstaff. While attuned, this staff has the following additional functions:

-  Forest Ki: Your connection to the soul of the forest allows you to draw on the forest for extra ki. The staff contains a ki reservoir equal to your Wisdome modifier, which you can use interchangeably with your normal ki pool. This ki is restored whenever you take a short rest. 
-  Commune with Nature: Once per day, you can connect yourself to the natural world around you, entering a trance to commune with nature. This has the effect of the  Commune with Nature spell, but may reveal additional information at the DM’s discretion. If you have already used this ability, you can use it again by spending 6 ki. 
-  Speak with Plants: Once per day, you can use the staff to extend your consciousness and allow you speak with plants, as the Speak with Plants spell. If you have already used this ability, you can spend 4 ki to use it again. 
- Spirit Guidance: You can reach out to the spirits of the Dreamworld through your ki. You can spend 3 ki to cast Augury; you can only do this once per day.
- Death Blessing: You have advantage on Death saving throws. 
- Time Manipulation: When you score a critical hit against a creature with your staff, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC. Succeed or fail, the target takes an extra **1d6**![](chrome-extension://gnblbpbepfbfmoobegdogkglpbhcjofh/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) necrotic damage. On a fail, they are also under the effects of the slow spell; they can repeat the save at the end of each turn to end the effect.

The spiritual beings of the [Footprint of the Gods](<../../../../gazetteer/far-south/azta-lekua.md>) carved four tokens on [Kenzo](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)’s staff, each representing a different spiritual ki. 

- Amezza ki: You can spend 3 ki to cast Augury; you can only do this once per day. You also have a pool of Amezza ki, which does not regenerate. You can drain the Amezza ki to enter a trance that allows you to visit the [Dreamworld](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/dreamworld.md>).
- Hutsu ki: You have advantage on death saving throws. You also have a pool of Hutsu ki, which does not regenerate. You can drain this pool to grasp one departing spirit and, if they are willing, return them to the material plane. Choose one creature that has been dead for no more than 24 hours; if the body is intact, you restore them to life.
- Urtaro ki: You have a pool of Urtaro ki, which does not regenerate. You can drain the Urtaro ki to cleanse the spirit of one creature. This removes all conditions, curses, reductions to their ability scores, and reductions to their hit point maximum.
- Ohana ki: When you score a critical hit against a creature with your staff, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC. Succeed or fail, the target takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage. On a fail, they are also under the effects of the Slow spell; they can repeat the save at the end of each turn to end the effect. You also have a pool of Ohana ki, which does not regenerate. You can drain the Ohana ki to enhance your speed and reflexes, granting you the benefits of the Haste spell for the next minute. You do not need to maintain concentration on this effect

The spirit of [Hralgar](<../../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) lingers in the staff, granting you access to storm giant ki. 
- Storm giant ki: You can expend this ki to contact Hralgar or another storm giant elder whose name you know (if you meet/learn about any others). Doing so allows you to meld with the storm giant, allowing you to ask up to 5 questions, which can be answered with no more than a sentence or two. You must ask all your questions, and receive your answers, within no more than 10 minutes. When you break contact, you must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 2d6 lightning damage for each question asked on a failed save, and half as much on a successful save. Once you use this ki, it can be recharged after 24 hours have passed by taking at least 35 points of lightning damage at once.

[Kaikkea](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>) briefly inhabited the staff while striking to destroy the scepter, granting you access to ocean ki.
- Ocean ki: You can expend this ki to....

title: Cha'mutte’s Shadow Armband
---

An armband created by Cha’mutte and used to open portals to shadow realms during the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). The armbands were created in pairs, with each pair attuned to a particular shadow realm, allowing portals to be opened a great distance apart in Taelgar that could be spanned in a short amount of time by crossing through the pocket dimension. 

[Delwath](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) has an armband that is one of a pair (the other pair is lost or destroyed), which opens a portal to a pocket realm where a large hobgoblin army has been trapped since the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). Activating the portal requires attunement to the armband. In [Delwath](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>)'s experience, being attuned drains you and weakens you, however.

# Hralgar's Phasing Stone
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Legendary [Giant](<../../../../species/children-of-the-riving/giants.md>) Magic [Phasing Stone](<../../../../things/magic-items/phasing-stones.md>)__  
   Owned owned by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>)  
</div>


A [Phasing Stone](<../../../../things/magic-items/phasing-stones.md>), once possessed by the giant [Hralgar](<../../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>), and [recovered](<../../session-notes/session-73-dufr.md>) from [his palace](<../../../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/hralgar-s-palace.md>) in the [Sentinels](<../../../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>)

This particular phasing stone encapsulates the power of the [Dreamworld](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/dreamworld.md>). Now, connected to the skyship [Vindristjarna](<../../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), it powers the magical effects that allow the ship to fly, by allowing one to dream of impossible things.

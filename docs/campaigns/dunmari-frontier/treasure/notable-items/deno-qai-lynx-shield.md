![Lynx Shield](../../../../assets/lynx-shield.png){align="right"; width="400"}A magical shield of Deno'qai make, decorated with a lynx motif. This shield was originally made with the blessings of the [tanshi](<../../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/tanshi.md>) for [Balati](<../../../../people/historical-figures/balati.md>), a Denoâ€™qai hero in the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). After Balati fell in battle, the shield preserved by the [Ko'zula](<../../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/northern-tribes/ko-zula.md>) tribe, along with Balati's [armor](<./deno-qai-scale-mail.md>). 


In DR 1748, this shield was [gifted](<../../session-notes/session-53-dufr.md>) to [Delwath](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) by [Enon](<../../../../people/deno-qai/enon.md>), the Godcaller of the [Ko'zula](<../../../../groups/deno-qai-tribes/northern-tribes/ko-zula.md>), to aid on his quest to rescue the [Meswati](<../../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/meswati.md>). During the course of [Delwath's adventure](<../../session-notes/session-54-dufr.md>), this shield gained the blessings of the six lost tanshi as [they were freed](<../../session-notes/session-55-dufr.md>): [Midri](<../../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/midri.md>), [K'onisati](<../../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/k-onisati.md>), [Nisir](<../../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/nisir.md>), [Taraka](<../../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/taraka.md>), [Yalik'i](<../../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/yalik-i.md>), and [Yezali](<../../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/yezali.md>). Later, [Umli](<../../../../people/other-nonhumans/umli.md>) [enhanced](<../../session-notes/session-90-dufr.md>) the shield with [Skaer Steel](<../../../../things/materials/skaer-steel.md>).

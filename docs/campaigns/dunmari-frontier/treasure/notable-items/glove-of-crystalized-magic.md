![Glove of Crystallized Magic](../../../../assets/glove-of-crystallized-magic.jpg){align="right"; width="400"}A glove constructed by [Seeker](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) in [Shimmersong](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>), from shards of crystalized magic gifted to [Seeker](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) by [Illaran](<../../../../people/fey/illaran.md>). These shards allow you to manipulate magic as you cast spells, currently either by changing the range of spells, or by shifting the elemental effects of a spell.Â 

Improved by [Faldrak](<../../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) at the Elemental Forge.

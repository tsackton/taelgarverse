title: Hralgar's Eyes
---

Two stone eyes, approximately bowling ball sized but very heavy, realistically carved. Taken from [Fausto](<../../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) in his tower in [Session 48 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-48-dufr.md>).

Presumed to be necessary to restore [Hralgar](<../../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) somehow. 

- [Hralgar's Eyes](<./hralgar-s-eyes.md>) (legendary major item*, party), returned to [Hralgar](<../../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) as part of freeing him.

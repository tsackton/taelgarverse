# The Dunmari Heirloom Shield
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **Uncommon [Dunmari](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) Magical Armor**  

An elaborate shield from the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) era, Dunmari design, found in [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>)'s hut. Subsequently reinforced by [Jasu](<../../../../people/dunmari/jasu.md>), the smith in [Karawa](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), with adamantine found in the [dwarven outpost](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dwarven-outpost-raven-s-hold.md>) near [Raven's Hold](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/raven-s-hold.md>). Destroyed in order to recover the Adamantine to construct the phasing stone harness on [Vindristjarna](<../../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>).

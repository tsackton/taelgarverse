This suit of studded leather armor is glamoured with illusion magic. While worn, its appearance adapts to wearer, and can be controlled at will when attuned. 

This suit was found [Grimbaskal's Hoard](<../grimbaskal-s-hoard.md>), and later enhanced by [Nahto](<../../../../people/kenku/nahto.md>), the kenku tinkerer, to be able to summon glamoured wings and allow the wearer to fly for a few hours a day.Â

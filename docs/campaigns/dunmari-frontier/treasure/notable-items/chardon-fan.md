# The Chardon Fan
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Object de Art__  
   Owned by [Kenzo](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)  
</div>


A cotton and bamboo hand fan depicting the towers of [Chardon](<../../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), the intricate design painted onto the fan by a very skilled artist. The fan is held shut by an ingenious bamboo clasp, carved to resemble a mounted knight dipping his lance to a lady; their clasped hands form the 'lock'. 

Looted from [Agata's hut](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/agata-s-lair.md>) by [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) in . Probably worth 10-180 gp.

Seen in [Mirror of the Past](<./mirror-of-the-past.md>): [Chardon Fan Vision](<../../mirror-visions/chardon-fan-vision.md>).

Carried by [Kenzo](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>).

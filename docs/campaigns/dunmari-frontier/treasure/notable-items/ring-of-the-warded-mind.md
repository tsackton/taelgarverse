This dull silver ring, of Dwarven make, is difficult to focus on, always seeming to want to slide out of your eyesight. It radiates abjuration magic. 


[Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>) was wearing this ring, and it was taken by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>). Soon after [Seeker](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) attuned to this ring, he was telepathically contacted by a fey creature, claiming to be [Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>), a native of the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>). [Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) said that she was once the guardian of an ancient tree in the [Heartwood Grove](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/heartwood-grove.md>), in [Amberglow](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), protecting a tree that was the essence of wood itself. [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>), when she was banished from the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), stole a branch of this tree, using it for nefarious magic. [Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) was sent to retrieve this branch, but she failed, and was killed by [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>). Yet, [Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) says, [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>) did not know the power of this ring. When she died, her soul was preserved in this ring, and now she is seeking a way to return to the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), where she believes she can be reborn if she returns to the [Heartwood Grove](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/heartwood-grove.md>). The ring, she says, was a gift of the [dwarven](<../../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) scholar [Daruk](<../../../../people/dwarves/daruk.md>), who traveled to the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>) many years ago, seeking to understand the elemental essences of living things. 

For many months, the supposed soul of [Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) rested patiently in the ring, until the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), with the fey wanderer [Caulaus](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/caulaus.md>), brought the ring to the [Heartwood Grove](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/heartwood-grove.md>). Here they [learned that Typhina was actually Agata](<../../session-notes/session-67-dufr.md>) in disguise, and the real [Typhina](<../../../../people/fey/typhina.md>) had been killed in the [Heartwood Grove](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/heartwood-grove.md>) long ago, when Agata stole the branch in the first place.

# Agata's Wooden Figurines
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Fey](<../../../../species/children-of-the-riving/fey/fey.md>) Figurines**  

A collection of detailed, lifelike wooden carvings of people found in Agata's house, all of which radiate complex transmutation magic.

- A young girl, maybe 3 years old, with light brown skin and dark shoulder-length hair, big, curious brown eyes, and a chubby face, now broken in half and no longer radiating magic. This is [Jumi](<../../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>). Freed. Casting Dispel Magic on [Jumi](<../../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>) herself, mostly turned to wood, ended the magic on [Jumi](<../../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>) and the figure of [Jumi](<../../../../people/dunmari/jumi.md>).Â 
- An older halfling man, easily into his 80s or 90s, with a wrinkled face, stained traveling clothes, blue eyes and curly graying hair. Tentatively identified as one of the Tealeaf family, a large merchant clan that once traded between [Chardon](<../../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) and eastern [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>). Freed; name is [Garret Tealeaf](<../../../../people/halflings/garret-tealeaf.md>), captured by [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>) 11 years ago.
- [A young woman](<../../../../people/dunmari/kaya.md>), maybe around 16, with dark brown skin, long braided black hair, and green eyes, wearing ill-fitting chain mail and carrying a spear. Probably Dunmari, but the clothes are very archaic. Freed; but at the moment fairly catatonic and has not spoken.
- [A middle aged man](<../../../../people/dunmari/shandar.md>), maybe 50, wearing stained and repeatedly mended riding clothes, with short cropped white hair, lightly tanned, with a bony, lined face and a bow and quiver on his back. Probably Dunmari, but the clothes are very archaic. Freed; but at the moment fairly catatonic and has not spoken.

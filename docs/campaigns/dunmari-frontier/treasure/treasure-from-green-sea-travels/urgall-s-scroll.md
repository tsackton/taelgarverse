The words of Mashtu the Corruptor, who has given me power over the ocean, recorded here in secret least I forget my purpose. 

[Urgall](<../../../../people/skaer/urgall-the-black.md>), the voice said. You will go to the sacred places on these seas: the holy wells of Parmo, the sacred waters of [Vetta](<../../../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/vetta.md>), the waters beneath Quanyi, the ancient temple among the ruins of Nkasa, the blessed springs of Beresa, and the sunken garden of Inulvis.

Six times you will summon me, and six times I will come to corrupt the ancient waters. 

Six times you will be bathed in my power, and six times you will emerge stronger.

Once you have done this, you will control the very sea itself, from east to west, as far as water can flow.

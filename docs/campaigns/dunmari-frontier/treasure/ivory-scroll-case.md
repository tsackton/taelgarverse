# The Ivory Scroll Case
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **Scroll Case**  

An elaborate ivory scroll case. This once contained a scroll of demon summoning, given to the leader of the [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>) by [Agata Dustmother](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>), in partial payment for the [Scepter of Command](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/scepter-of-command.md>). The scroll this case once contained was used to summon [Oduk](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/oduk.md>), a demon of the Abyss, to create a gnoll army, provoking the Summer Gnoll Raids of 1748 and allowing the [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>) to slip into [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) undetected, with the waves of refugees.

One end of this scroll case was found by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) outside Raven's Hold on [April 13, 1748](<../session-notes/session-13-dufr.md>). The remaining case and cap were found by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) in the lair of the [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>) in[Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>). The intact case was sold in [Darba](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>) for 80 gp.

Some of its history was revealed by [Mirror of the Past](<./mirror-of-the-past.md>):

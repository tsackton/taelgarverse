# Hralgar's Eyes
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **Magical Wonderous Item**  

A pair of giant eyes, made of stone. These are two stone eyes, a bit smaller than a human head, and very heavy. They are exquisitely and realistically carved to resemble the eyes of a giant. 


These eyes were taken from the statue of Hralgar in [Stormcaller Tower](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>), by [Dee Wildcloak](<../../../people/halflings/dee-wildcloak.md>), [Dain Goldhammer](<../../../people/dwarves/dain-goldhammer.md>), and [Alban](<../../../people/chardonians/alban.md>), on a mission funded by [Fausto](<../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) for the [Society of the Open Scroll](<../../../groups/chardonian-organizations/society-of-the-open-scroll.md>), in DR 1748. They were kept in Fausto's tower in [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) for several months, in until they were [recovered](<../session-notes/session-48-dufr.md>) by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>). Eventually, they were returned to [Hralgar](<../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) as [part of the process of freeing him from his bonds](<../session-notes/session-71-dufr.md>).

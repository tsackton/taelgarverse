# The Binding Stones of Amloch
>[!info]+ Information
> (legendary wonderous item)
> 
>> 

A set of five crystals, each a different color, originally located on the crown carved into the stone head of [Hralgar](<../../../../people/giants/hralgar.md>) in [Stormcaller Tower](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>). [Seeker](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)’s study reveals these are part of a complex mechanism to imprison, incapacitate, and then draw magical power from a creature, but exactly how to combined them to create magical effects is not yet clear. 

Taken by the party from [Fausto](<../../../../people/chardonians/fausto.md>) while fleeing his tower in [Session 48 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-48-dufr.md>).

# Liquid Wood
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **Unique [Fey](<../../../species/children-of-the-riving/fey/fey.md>) Magical Wonderous Item**  

A strange, putty like substance that seems to ooze and bubble slowly, almost maliciously. Apparently an invention of the hag [Agata Dustmother](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>), used to transform humanoids into wooden puppets. 

While the details of how the magic exactly works are not known, the basic process involves mixing the blood of the victim into the wooden putty, and using magic to then bind the creature to the wood, by shaping their likeness. The enchantment is not permanent, unless an additional physical token, such as a piece of hair or a tooth, is bound to the likeness. When this is done, the victim also becomes highly suggestible to the commands of the creator. 

The enchantment can be reversed with magic that dispels curses or magical effects. 

As far as is known, this is a unique item, created by [Agata Dustmother](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>), and later destroyed by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>).

The treasure recovered from the Elemental Forge.
## Mundane Items
A well-constructed set of jeweler’s tools, and material to stock a jeweler’s workshop recovered from the workshop shelves. 
Four projects in various states of completion:
- A delicate gold necklace with a pendant setting designed to hold a gemstone, but empty

- A finely engraved platinum ring set with a tiny but perfect sapphire
- A silver tiara set with moonstones
Items recovered from the workshop shelves:
- 8 heavy gold bars, each weighing 10 pounds and worth 500 gp (total value 4000 gp)
- 16 heavy silver bars, each weighing 5 pounds and worth 25 gp (total value 500 gp)
- 16 uncut and unpolished gemstones (value would increase if properly cut):
	- Two ruby (Deep red, radiant glow)
	- Three garnet (Dark red, glassy appearance)
	- Two peridot (Bright green, light-catching sparkle)
	- One opal (Multicolored, mystical fire)

## Semi-Magical Items
- A second copy of “The [Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum](<../../../things/books/enchiridion-of-the-occulta-ludum.md>)”, also blank. Found in the bedroom.
- Two tuning forks. One is attuned to the elemental plane of air; the other is attuned to an unknown plane. These can be used as part of the plane shift spell or other magic.
- Eight dragon scales, red 
- Eternal ice

## Magic Items
- Brooch of Warmth. Constructed by [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) from the detailed brooch enameled with brilliant reds, missing a central crystal, and an enchanted ruby found in the chest of gems, clearly meant to fit into the brooch. While attuned to this item, the wearer gains resistance to cold damage, and is unaffected by temperatures as low as -50 degrees.
- Ring of Sharp Mind. Constructed by [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) and [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) from the plain gold ring with an empty setting for a small gem, and an enchanted diamond found in the chest of gems, clearly meant to fit into the ring. If you fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell while wearing this ring, you can expend your reaction to succeed instead. Once you do this, a facet of the diamond turns cloudy. The diamond has six facets. When all facets are cloudy, the ring becomes non-magical. 
- A Fides Lucaris Sending Stone. Found in a hidden lead box, and once possessed by the woman whose skeleton remains in the elemental forge. A boy in a small village in [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) has its pair, and thinks it is his imaginary friend Benji talking. 
- A small crystal vial containing one dose of universal solvent. Found in a hidden lead box, and used to destroy the silver threads binding the trapped elemental in the elemental forge. 
- A gray cloak. Also found in the lead box. Functions as a Cloak of Elvenkind.
- A silver wand that functions as an arcane focus, and a locked spellbook. Found in the hidden lead box and also once possessed by the woman whose skeleton remains in the elemental forge.
- Cold Box. Found in the pantry/storeroom in the living quarters. A 3 foot by 3 foot stone chest that preserves food kept inside indefinitely. Installed on [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>).
- Pitcher of Purity. A silver water pitcher found in the bedroom in the living quarters. Any non-magical liquid put inside turns permanently to pure water. Now part of the kitchen equipment on [Vindristjarna](<../../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). 
## Left Behind
- A 2000 pound magical forge that can be heated to temperatures required to smelt metal without fuel. 
## Used
- Phoenix feather, used to allow [Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>)'s stone bird to fly, among other things. 
- Elemental rods (one each of fire, earth, air, water), used to improve [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)'s glove of crystallized magic.
- Starlight dew (used for cloud generator)
- Spectral prism (used for rainbow bridge)
- Four silver bars (used for cloud generator)
- Four vials of mercury (used for rainbow bridge and cloud generator)
- Piece of [inkaye](<../../../things/materials/inkaye.md>) (used for rainbow bridge)

[Faldrak](<../../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) requests the phoenix feather, the brooch of warmth, one silver bar, one-half a gold bar, and the jeweler's tools as his 1/16 share.

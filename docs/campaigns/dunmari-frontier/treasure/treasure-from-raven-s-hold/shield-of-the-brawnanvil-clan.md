title: Shield of the Brawnanvil Clan
---

An elaborate decorative shield, not useful in battle. It is made of polished steel, with elaborate decorations of scenes from Dwarven life adorning it.

While holding the shield, a dwarf can activate it, being drawn into a recreation of a story from the Brawnanvil past. A Brawnanvil can guide the story to a particular memory or place.

Recovered by [Riswynn](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) and now safely with the Brawnanvil clan in [Tharn Todor](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/tharn-todor.md>).

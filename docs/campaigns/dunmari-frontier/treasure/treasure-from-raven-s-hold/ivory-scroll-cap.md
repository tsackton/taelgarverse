# Ivory Scroll Cap
>[!info]+ Item Info
>(mundane scroll case)

An elaborate ivory scroll case. 

One end cap was found by [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) outside Raven's Hold on [April 13, 1748](<../../session-notes/session-13-dufr.md>). Eventually revealed to be part of the case of a demon summoning scroll, traded by [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>) to the [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>), as part of the deal for the [Scepter of Command](<../../../../things/artifacts-of-power/scepter-of-command.md>). The remaining case and cap were found by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) in the lair of the [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>) in[Tokra](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>). 

Sold in [Darba](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>) for 80 gp. 

Some of its history was revealed by [The Mirror of the Past](<../treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/the-mirror-of-the-past.md>): [Ivory Scroll Cap Vision](<../../mirror-visions/ivory-scroll-cap-vision.md>)

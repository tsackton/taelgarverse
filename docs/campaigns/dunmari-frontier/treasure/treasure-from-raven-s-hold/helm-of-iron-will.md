A helmet from the Drankorian era, enchanted to protect warriors in battle. Found in Raven's Hold. Used by [Delwath](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) in battle against [Agata](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>) in [Session 28 (DuFr)](<../../session-notes/session-28-dufr.md>), protected him from the frightening effects of her hag's eye.

> >Game Effect: Meditation Chamber + Courtyard (Vast)
> >Size: 40 squares (Vast Courtyard, Cramped Meditation Chamber)
> >Order: Empower (1d8 BP)
> 
> When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you enable all your Bastion’s hirelings to use the Meditation Chamber to gain a measure of inner peace. You can immediately issue a Bastion order to one of your Bastion’s other special facilities, even if that facility has already been issued an order on this Bastion turn. The Meditation Chamber also imparts the following benefit: 
> 
> **Fortify Self**. You can meditate in this facility over a period of 7 days to fortify your mind, body, and spirit. If you leave the Bastion during this time, you gain no benefit. Otherwise, at the end of the seventh day, you gain Advantage on two kinds of saving throws for the next 7 days, chosen randomly from the Fortified Saves table. (Reroll if you get a duplicate result.)

> >Size: 128 squares (Roomy Basic Quarters x9)

> [!info]+ Map Room
> >Tended by: ~mapmaker~
> >Game Effect: Library
> >Size: 4 squares (Cramped)
> > Order: Research (1d4 BP) 
> 
> This Library contains a collection of books plus one or more desks and reading chairs. When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to research a topic, or you do the research yourself. The topic can be a legend, a known event or location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, you obtain up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to you. The DM determines what information you learn.

> [!info]+ Hall of Stories
> >Tended by: [Amil](<../../people/dunmari/amil.md>) and [Kenzo](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>)
> >Game Effect: Trophy Room
> >Size: 36 squares (Vast)
> > Order: Research (1d6 BP)
> This room houses a collection of mementos, such as weapons from old battles, gifts from benefactors, the mounted heads of slain creatures, trinkets plucked from dungeons and ruins, and trophies passed down from ancestors. When you issue the Research order to this facility, choose one of the following options: 
> 
> **Research: Lore**. You commission the facility’s hireling to research a topic of your choice, or you do the research yourself. The topic can be a legend, any kind of creature, or a famous object. The topic need not be directly related to items on display in the room, as the trophies provide clues to research a wide variety of other subjects. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, you obtain up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to you. The DM determines what information is learned. 
> 
> **Research: Trinket Trophy**. You commission the facility’s hireling to search for a trinket that might be of use to you. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, roll a die. If the number rolled is odd, the hireling finds nothing useful. If the number rolled is even, the hireling finds a trinket with a previously unknown magical property. You can decide what the trinket looks like or roll on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook to determine its form. As a Magic action, a creature can use the trinket to cast a particular spell, requiring no spell components. Choose the spell from the following list: Clairvoyance, Death Ward, Find Traps, Locate Creature, Magic Weapon, Remove Curse, or Speak with Dead. Once used in this way, the trinket loses its magic.

> [!info]+ Observatory
> >Tended by: [Seeker](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>)
> >Game Effect: Observatory
> >Size: 16 squares (Roomy)
> > Order: Empower (1d8 BP)
> 
> Situated atop your Bastion, your Observatory contains a powerful telescope aimed at the night sky. You can use your Observatory to peer into the far corners of Wildspace and the Astral Plane, if not the heavens. Whenever you spend an entire Long Rest in your Observatory, you can cast Contact Other Plane once within the next 7 days without expending a spell slot. When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you enable yourself or the facility’s hireling to explore the eldritch mysteries of the stars for 7 consecutive nights. At the end of that time, roll a die. If the number rolled is even, nothing is gained. If the number rolled is odd, an unknown power bestows one of the following supernatural charms on you or another creature of your choice that is on the same plane of existence as you: Charm of Darkvision, Charm of Heroism, or Charm of Vitality (all described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide).


> [!info]+ Stable
> > Tended by: [Wellby](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>)
> >Game Effect: Stable
> >Size: 36 squares (Vast)
> >Order: Trade (1d6 BP)
> 
> A Bastion can have more than one Stable. Each Stable comes with one Riding Horse (or Camel) and two Ponies (or two Mules). The facility is big enough to house three Large animals. Two Medium creatures occupy the same amount of space as one Large creature. The facility’s hireling looks after these creatures. After a Beast that can serve as a mount spends at least 14 days in this facility, all Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made with respect to it have Advantage, as the animal becomes easier to handle. When you issue the Trade order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to buy or sell one or more mounts at normal cost, keeping the ones you buy in your Stable. The work takes 7 days, and the DM decides what types of animals are available for purchase— horses, ponies, and mules being the most common. The Mounts and Other Animals table in the Player’s Handbook gives standard prices for various mounts, including camels, horses, ponies, and mules. When you sell a mount from your Stable, the buyer pays you 20 percent more than the standard price; this profit increases to 50 percent when you reach level 13 and 100 percent when you reach level 17

> An Archive is a repository of valuable books, scrolls, and maps. It is usually attached to a Library behind a locked or secret door. Your Archive contains one copy of a rare and valuable reference book, chosen from the options in the Reference Books table. While you and this book are in your Bastion, you gain the book’s benefit, as noted in the table. (Your DM might make other reference books available.) When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to search the Archive for helpful lore. The work takes 7 days. Whoever does the work gains knowledge as if they had cast the Legend Lore spell. A hireling who gains this knowledge shares it with you the next time you speak with them.
>

When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to produce a specially prepared talisman for your use. The talisman usually takes the form of an amulet, a rune-carved box, or a statuette, but it can be any Tiny, nonmagical object that has religious significance. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. You can use this talisman as a Spellcasting Focus, ignoring any of the spell’s Material components, including ones that have a cost of 1,000 GP or less. The talisman can be used in this way only once, and then it must be returned to your Reliquary. Another Harvest order prepares it for use again.

> >Size: 36 squares (Vast)
> > Order: Trade (1d4 BP)
> 
> This cool, dark space is meant to contain trade goods (see the Trade Goods table in the Player’s Handbook) but can hold almost anything. When you issue the Trade order to this facility, its hireling spends the next 7 days procuring nonmagical items that have a total value of 500 GP or less and stores them in the Storehouse, or the hireling uses those 7 days to sell goods in the Storehouse. You bear the total cost of any purchases, and the maximum value of the items purchased increases to 2,000 GP when you reach level 9 and 5,000 GP when you reach level 13. The Equipment chapter of the Player’s Handbook has tables of common goods that can be bought. When you sell goods from your Storehouse, the buyer pays you 10 percent more than the standard price; this profit increases to 20 percent when you reach level 9, 50 percent when you reach level 13, and 100 percent when you reach level 17.

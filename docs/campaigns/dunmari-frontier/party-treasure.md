- A large carved wooden statue of a dragon, painted in vivid greens and with two emeralds for eyes. Weighs at least 2000 pounds, if not more.

- [Deno’qai Eagle Shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5346731-denoqai-eagle-shield) (give to [Theba](<../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>)): A enchanted wooden shield, brightly painted and carved with an eagle motif.

- [Deno’qai Lightning Spear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5346735-denoqai-lightning-spear) (give to [Theba](<../../people/deno-qai/theba.md>)): A spear decorated with lightning motifs. Functions as a +1 spear, with 60 foot short range and no long range. Has 3 charges, which it regains each day at dawn. Can use 3 charges to cause the spear to turn into a lightning bolt as you hurl it, which has the effect of casting the lightning bolt spell but with a range of 60' instead of the normal range of the spell. If you hurl it at a target, make an attack roll against the target as normal: on a hit, they take the normal spear damage and have disadvantage on the lightning bolt saving throw. You can also expend 1 charge to do an extra 2d6 lightning damage on a hit. (Spell Save DC is equal to your 8 + ability score used for the attack roll + proficiency)

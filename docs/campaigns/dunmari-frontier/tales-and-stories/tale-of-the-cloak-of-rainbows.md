{title: Tale of the Cloak of Rainbows}

*He tells of the first days of the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>), before there was a cloak. He tells of Ilios the Bright, who fell through the world when he was just an infant, not yet chained to [Thark](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s will, and grew strong in the [Fey](<../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) realm of [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>), under a sunset sky free of [Thark](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s influence. Ilios, it is said, had a [Fey](<../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) energy that could not be contained. His eyes shone with moonlight, and his swords flashed silver. He began to raid across the foothills of the [Sentinels](<../../../gazetteer/sentinel-range.md>), where small, disorganized groups of [orcs](<../../../species/orcs.md>), families and tribes hidden from the Drankorian patrols lived. Ilios stole the unchained babies from these tribes, and brought them to [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>), where The [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) grew in secret, protected by the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>).* 

*And then Azagar speaks of the blackness that tore out the sun, the rift through which darkness leaked. The invasion of [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>) by a far distant evil, something of no world. Ilios leapt through this blackness and severed the cords that held this rift open, trapping himself to an unknown fate, but saving [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>). In honor of his sacrifice, the [Cloudspinner](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>) wove the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>), each thread plucked from the immortal sunsets of [Amberglow](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>), each thread grasping the essence of the [Riving](<../../../events/ancient/riving.md>), the long pause, the splitting of the planes that created the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/feywild.md>), and wrapping that energy of pulling, separating into a cloak that cut the wearer from the divine.*

*[Azogar](<../../../people/orcs/azogar.md>)'s voice shifts, and he tells the story of the days in the world when the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) ventured forth, the quiet days, living lives of fields and flowers. In the story of their history, this was a remembered time of peace and happiness, but it could not last, for [Azogar](<../../../people/orcs/azogar.md>) turns to the tale of [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>), and [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>).* 

*[Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>), it is said, traveled among the [orcs](<../../../species/orcs.md>), teaching them, preaching the fate he sought for all the people of the world: freedom from the divine, as the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) had found. But then betrayal, whether intentional or not, telling [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) of the dream, of the cloak. And then the war, and loss, and defeat as [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>) turned on the [orcs](<../../../species/orcs.md>) and stole the cloak. That this because [Apollyon](<../../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>)'s downfall, as [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) turned on his former ally, was no comfort, and [Azogar](<../../../people/orcs/azogar.md>) speaks bitter words as he tells how the cloak was lost and the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) scattered to hide in small groups where they could. 

*Until, after the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the hero [Uzgash](<../../../people/orcs/uzgash.md>) found the cloak unexpectedly amongst the ruins of a Dunmari fort, and with the cloak proclaimed the safe haven of [Xurkhaz](<../../../gazetteer/upper-istaros/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), the land of the rising sun, a beacon of hope for the scattered [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>).*

### Session 1
*in Taelgar, May 16th - May 17th 1688 (on Earth, September 11th, 2022)*

In Ausson’s Crossing, Roland has been murdered. Roe DeTokra, Robin, and Izar all come to the village for various reasons, chasing rumors of the murder or other mysteries, and meet each other in the courtyard of the Last Inn. On hearing of Roland’s murder, all three wish dearly to find out what happened. Lisette, Roland’s wife, greets them and also asks them to investigate, and so they agree to. 

Soon after they arrive, Roland’s memorial and burial begins. Izar speaks, and Robin shares a blessing of [the Wanderer](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-wanderer.md>), and during the ceremony Robin gets a sense of dread: something has damaged or destroyed Roland’s soul. Further investigation leads to the discovery that all four of the murdered folk: Tomas, Dominck, Roland, and Eva were gruesomely killed and tortured, and all four of them seem to have their souls damaged or destroyed. Tomas and Dominck were killed first, and Izar observes that the damage seems to have gotten more refined, and crueler, as the murders progressed.

Distrubed, and at Lisette’s begging, the party goes to talk to Pierre, Roland’s husband, and clearly someone close to Robin. After an emotional scene, with Robin’s encouragement and support, Pierre slowly tells the tale of how Roland died: Pierre awoke one evening to see two black shadows on the ceiling and was possessed in some fashion, forced to hold a pillow over Roland’s face as he was tortured and killed by small eyeless black creatures. Reassured somewhat by Robin, Pierre seems to acknowledge that there must have been external magic, not something wrong with him, and the party goes to the wake for Roland.

At the wake they talk to many people and learn much of the goings on of the town, but don’t really isolate a specific suspect or suspicious person. They learn that Roshan (who has lost her memories) was likely a victim of this same attack - her soul was damaged in a similar way to Roland, Eva, and the caravan guards. They learn that Annais Chavert is suspicious of Hugo, but after talking to Hugo, believe it is probably ancient prejudice, not a well-grounded fear. The party also learns that [Vistra Fireforge](<../../people/dwarves/vistra-fireforge.md>) was charmed by Gilles Festu to give him an unreasonably good price on some dwarven steel, which is why she was arguing with the guards. Finally, they learn Darrak Deepmine is being a bit squirrelly about when he came to town.

As the wake wraps up, Robin gives a speech, begging everyone to sleep in groups and not spend the night alone – afraid that the dangerous nighttime evil will strike again. His speech is a rousing success – amazing oratory, striking just the right note of calm and urgency, and the village responds, willinging following Robin’s direction.

That evening, around 2am, the party is attacked in their rooms by corrupted bats and chokers, hideous stalkers with massive teethed tentacles. These enemies are quickly dispatched, although the party does get bloodied. After the combat, the town is roused, and Robin leads a headcount while Roe (as a cave bear) and Izar search quietly. The only person who is missing is Darrak Deepmine, who the party determines, vie some skillful scent-tracking, seems to be in a small, nondescript shack, enchanted to be undetectable and hard to see or notice. After some brief discussions (and some guidance from the [lizardfolk](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) ancestors) the party decides going into the strange shack before dawn is a bad idea, and some rest is called for. Fairly confident, but not 100% certain, that Darrak is not a hostage, the party returns to the inn to rest and regroup before the next morning’s adventure.

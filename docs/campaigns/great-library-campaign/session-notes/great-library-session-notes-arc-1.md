# The Chronicles of the Quest for the Elemental Scrolls

The first major adventure of the [Silver Tempests](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>), before they acquired their wealth and fame, was in service of the [Great Library](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>), hired by Archivist [Lyra](<../../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>) to recover the lost elemental scrolls, that had been created by a famous wizard, [Airion Mistspeaker](<../../../people/other-humans/airion.md>), before the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), but lost during the chaos of the [Blood Years](<../../../events/1500s/blood-years.md>). Along the way, they helped some [centaurs](<../../../species/unusual-species/centaurs.md>) with a curse; helped the soul of Xameia of the Order of Twilight find peace; helped Iara, a lizardfolk woman; and made enemies of the [orcs](<../../../species/orcs.md>) of [Grumella's Horde](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/grumella-s-horde.md>). 

We begin on the road to Chardon, as two aspiring adventurers meet...
## Adventure 0: Die Froggies Die

### Session 0

[Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) and [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) meet on the road to [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), both seeking adventure. Finding a dead horse, they chase some [bullywugs](<../../../species/unusual-species/bullywugs.md>) into a swamp and recover a message bag from a messenger.
### Events

- Feb 16, 1747 DR: [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) and [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) meet on the road south of [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) and retrieve a lost messenger bag from a messenger killed by [bullywugs](<../../../species/unusual-species/bullywugs.md>). 
## Adventure 1: The Flamekeeper Scroll
### Session 1

Our adventure starts on the road: [Brelith](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>), [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) , [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>), and [Alton](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/alton.md>) have traveled north towards [Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>) to meet Archivist [Lyra](<../../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>), in the service of the [Great Library](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>). On the road goblins of the Red Knife tribe attack; they slay two and let the other two live, after learning that hobgoblins and goblins live in this area. The goblins are told to flee and not attack them again.

In [Lyra](<../../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>)’s camp, the party learns their mission: search for the scrolls of elemental power. The location of the Flamekeeper Scroll and the Stonemaster Scroll are known, while the location of the Skyborn Scroll and the Deepwater Scroll are not. 

Our heroes decide to head to the Forge of Fire, a part of an ancient Dwarven mine complex that once extended through much of the [Fiamatara Mountains](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/fiamatara-mountains/fiamatara-mountains.md>), where the Flamekeeper Scrollis thought to be. They find it is now a kobold shrine to the “fire god”, which is a rune protecting the Flamekeeper Scroll. After killing some [kobolds](<../../../species/unusual-species/kobolds.md>) and convincing others they are the fire god made flesh, they get the scroll, and leave, but not before triggering a magma eruption which destroys forge and probably all the kobolds.

After a challenging battle, they manage to prevail, and learn that the temple is the location of a portal to the [Abyss](<../../../cosmology/spiritual-realms/abyss.md>), which must be closed before the temple can be cleansed. Gathering some treasures and items remaining in the crypt (including a necklace of spell storing and a cloak of twilight), they return to town to consider their next move. 

### Session 14

Back in [Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>),  [Brelith](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>), [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>), [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>), and [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) attempt to find someone who can help them close the Abyssal portal and cleanse the temple. They are directed to the priest Galius Filuso, an adventurer and traveler from [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) interested in the history of the Order of Twilight as he attempts to restore it to its former glory. Traveling with Galius back to the temple, the party sets up to defend him for the 24 hours it will take to cast the Hallow spell and close the portal. The first wave of attackers -- minor demons and their minions --  are relatively easily defeated.

### Session 15

Continuing to defend the temple, in the middle of the night the remnants of the xvart tribe, allies and servants of the demons, attack from the hidden entrance to the crypt. After they are defeated, as dawn approaches and the spell is nearly complete, a large, four-armed, clawed demon, a glabrezu, steps from the portal and heads for Galius. The party is able to defeat it, however, and the spell is complete. As the portal closes, and the curse is lifted from the temple, Xameia can finally rest. In thanks for their efforts, an avatar of [The Night Queen](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-night-queen.md>)herself appears, and offers each member of the party a boon.

## Adventure 10: The Messenger and the Kobolds

### Session 16

Returning from the success of restoring the temple of the Order of Twilight, [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>), [Brelith](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>), [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>), and [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) are invited to meet the [proconsul](<../../../people/chardonians/anton-lavernia.md>), the governor of [Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>), and given permission to enter the walled city itself. After this meeting, they receive word a messenger bearing information about the last elemental scroll has gone missing, and head out on a mission from Archivist [Lyra](<../../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>) to ransom the messenger from [kobolds](<../../../species/unusual-species/kobolds.md>). While they are able to ransom the messenger, Amus, they realize that he does not have the map they need to locate the scroll: it has been taken by the kobolds. Leaving Amus in a well-hidden camp, the party deduces that the kobolds may try to get the map to [Grumella](<../../../people/orcs/grumella.md>). Searching for hidden exits from the lair, they find several, and set a careful ambush. With some clever planning, the ambush is a success and the scroll is recovered, after which the party returns to their camp to rest and plot their next move. 
### Events

- Jul 11, 1747 DR: The party, with [Aglath](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aglath.md>), ambushes the kobolds and retrieves the map to the Skyborn Scroll. 

## Adventure 11: The Skyborn Scroll
### Session 17

Camped outside the kobold lair, [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>), [Brelith](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>), [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>), and [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) meet up with [Aglath](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aglath.md>) and contemplate their next move. The Skyborn scroll is thought to be located in Airion’s Tower, a floating tower deep in the highest peaks of the [Fiamatara Mountains](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/fiamatara-mountains/fiamatara-mountains.md>), near Blacksilver Peak, at the northern edge of the old Dwarven fortresses in these mountains. The party decides to head north. Heading north on the [plains](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/erbalta-plains/erbalta-plains.md>), they are attacked by a hobgoblin patrol returning to camp in the mountains, and nearly killed. Only some quick thinking from [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>), and an elemental summoned by [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>) while barely clinging to consciousness, keeps the party from ending up the prisoners of the hobgoblins. 

### Session 18

The party decides to move on quickly, after only a brief rest, trying to put some miles between the hobgoblin patrol route and themselves before camping for the night. The next day, they encounter their old companion Oskar on the plains, who has been traveling in this area with Stoneclaw. They decide to journey together for a time. Approaching the northern end of the mountains, they avoid a flash flood on the plains, and finally identify Blacksilver Peak and turn towards it. Finding a path up into the mountains, they encounter and defeat a frost giant who hates dwarves, and his pet remorhaz. Coming to some cliffs without an obvious way down, they meet a giant eagle who agrees to fly them to the old Dwarven road to Blacksilver Peak in exchange for a meal of giant goats.

### Session 19

After bargaining with the giant eagle, Oskar and Stoneclaw return to the plains, while [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>), [Aglath](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aglath.md>), [Brelith](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>), [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>), and [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) travel along the Dwarven road towardsBlacksilver Peak. On the way, they defeat a hunting party of basilisks. They find the entrance to an old Dwarven complex, which now seems to be inhabited by some other kind of beast or creature based on the piles of cast of bits of armor and clothes from dead victims in the entryway. 

### Session 20

Pressing further into the cave, the party finds it is now the lair of a pair of trolls, who are eventually defeated by [Aglath](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aglath.md>)’s burning hands. After navigating a chamber of regenerating stirges, the party finds a stair climbing up through the center of the mountain, and begin the long ascent to the top of Blacksilver Peak and hopefully Airion’s Tower and the scroll. During the ascent, they navigate (eventually) around a partial collapse of the stairs by use of the climbing abilities of [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>)’s giant spider form.

### Session 21

Continuing to ascend the endless stairs, the party arrives in a broken chamber, seemingly a former waystation but in disrepair. Here, they are ambushed by roving black puddings; while [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>)’s armor is destroyed, they otherwise manage to survive the encounter and make their way to the top of the stair. Here, the party ascends to a former Dwarven outpost. Deciding to explore north, they find a large cavern with a glint of light above. Despite [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>)’s ancestor’s warning that only woe will come of it, they decide to explore the light.

### Session 22  

Using summoned giant spiders to help explore the flash of light in the ceiling nearly 400’ above, the party faces predictably bad results, but do learn that there is a snowy landscape outside, although no way to access it from this small skylight. After a bit more aimless exploring, they find themselves face to face with some spirits of past wars, sword wraiths who are upset their stories have been forgotten, guarding what seems to be the exit from the Dwarven fortress. An attempted negotiation fails as the sword wraiths are not inclined to let them exit, but they are eventually defeated, and the party finds themselves looking out at a stormy glacier.

### Session 23

Exploring the snow and ice landscape at the top of Blacksilver Peak, the party finds tracks and a trail leading to a small cave complex, where they encounter Dinia, an old woman mysteriously living in this winter wasteland, and affectionately nicknamed Grandma Yoda by the party. She will help them find the tower, but only if they first take care of a yeti problem for her. After defeating an abominable yeti, they return to Dinia’s cave to rest before setting out in the predawn light to cross the glacier to the tower. While the glacier crossing is not without peril, with Dinia’s help they make it to a bridge leading across thin air to the tower entrance.

### Session 24

The party crosses the ice bridge, and encounters the guardians of the tower, a living statue of ice and its two ice fox companions. After managing to defeat these guardians, the party is faced with the puzzle of opening the door, which is locked with arcane sigils and runes. After solving the puzzle, the door swings open.

### Session 25

The party begins to explore the tower, passing through the grand illusion of the sky in the entrance room, and defeating a pair of animated suits of plate armor guarding the library. In the library they find some clues and treasure, and then proceed up, to the ruins of an alchemical laboratory. Here, they meet Mehrangeesa of Sulmana, a djinni trapped here with enchanted manacles. Mehrangeesa tells them some of the history of [Airion](<../../../people/other-humans/airion.md>), how different factions on the [Elemental Plane of Air](<../../../cosmology/energy-realms/elemental-plane-of-air.md>) saw him as relatively harmless or a great evil to be destroyed, and told them of Zadkai, a warlock devoted to a great power on the Elemental Plane of Air who wanted to see all humans who would interfere with the Plane of Air destroyed. After being freed, he tells them he will be listening if they find a way to get in touch, gifts [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>) with the power of whirlwind punches, and disappears.

### Session 26

Ascending to the final floor of the tower, the party encounters [Airion Mistspeaker](<../../../people/other-humans/airion.md>) himself, trapped in a magic circle and unable to retrieve the scroll. Tricked into helping him extract the scroll from the chest near him, [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) (in opposum form) hands the scroll over, only to have the illusion of [Airion](<../../../people/other-humans/airion.md>) fade, and the ruined, undead form of Zadkai appear in his place. After summoning four dust mephits, Zadkai casts dimension door and vanishes onto the icy bridge. The dust mephits are easy to destroy, after which the party rushes to the ceiling where the perceptive eyes of [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>), guided by [Brelith](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>)’s magic, pick out a small, running figure far below: Zadkai fleeing. Quickly conjuring two giant eagles to carry most of the party, while [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>) uses his monk magic to glide down the side of the tower, the party gives chase. In a climatic battle on the icy outskirts of the glacier, the [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) manages to retrieve the air scroll from Zadkai’s grasp, but despite a well-placed stunning strike from [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>), Zadkai vanishes just before he can be killed.

### Session 27

Spent after the battle, the adventurers decide to rest in the tower and head to Dinia’s after, when the sun is down and the glacier less prone to melt beneath their feet. As they rest, a glowing rune appears, growing and pulsing. Curiously and somewhat foolishly, [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) and [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>) sit by it, noticing that it grows faster when they get closer. After half an hour, two living lightning bolts appear and attack. The party rushes into combat, and although [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>) is knocked out, they win and resume their rest. 

After a full sleep, the rune appears again, and they leave before it is activated, resources refreshed. They make it across the glacier without much trouble due to [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) and [Brelith](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>)’s skills, and make it past a shifting crevice with [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>)’s (a little late) help. Before they reach Dinia’s, they encounter a wolf pack. [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) negotiates with his druidic and [lizardfolk](<../../../species/lizardfolk.md>) abilities, and [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>) suggests leading them to the frozen yeti corpse to eat. However, intelligent, magical alpha’s appear, interrupting. After tense bargaining, they get away, but not before [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>) acts foolishly and provokes a single parting attack. They reach Dinia’s and chat with her, learning more about [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>)’s history and the air scroll itself. Empowering by her stories, they leave on a route that the bard suggested, heading down the mountain. The session ends as an orc sentry from [Grumella's Horde](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/grumella-s-horde.md>) -- also chasing the scroll -- sees them and blows their horn.

### Session 28

They begin battling the orcs of [Grumella's Horde](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/grumella-s-horde.md>), and the fight is going well until they knock out the orc leader to interrogate later and find that two of the orcs are healers who revive their leader again and again. After eliminating the clerics with a critical hit from [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) and a flurried series of stunning strikes from [Aelar](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aelar.md>), they win, but one orc escapes. 

### Session 29 

After a brief interrogation with the orc leader, [Aglath](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/aglath.md>) kills him after he taunts them and refuses to talk, then they find a place to rest. Experimenting with magic items from the tower leads to empowering Thunderbrand and summoning a roc bound to [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>). They head back to [Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>) on the roc's back and are attacked by wyverns but fight them off. They arrive in [Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>) as heroes, and deliver the scroll to impressed Archivist [Lyra](<../../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>) after questioning her about the library’s responsibility with such a powerful artifact. They then get a break and several weeks of downtime to do what they please.

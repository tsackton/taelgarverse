# The Chronicles of the Quest for Answers to Extraplanar Mysteries

After months of waiting, clues to the mysterious disappearance of Urkabi, [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>)'s village, arrive with a new traveler, [Blue](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/blue.md>). The [Silver Tempests](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) set off to the south to investigate, traveling to the city of [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), and then into the mountains on a hunt for Yeshara, the wolf-eyed queen of a shadowy realm called Cairn Dor. Fighting through shadowy enemies, the [Silver Tempests](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) find a portal to Cairn Dor called the Cleaver-Stone, as well as a series of stone plinths that form a soul compass, facilitating the theft of mortals from the [Material Plane](<../../../cosmology/material-plane.md>) to serve as dreamers for the Shemra Azem, the sleepless, every-vigilant army of Cairn Dor. With the aid of clues found in the old Drankorian fortress guarding this place, the [Silver Tempests](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) shut down the portal and the soul compass, but retreat to [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>) to regroup before venturing into Cairn Dor itself. 

## Adventure 20: The Mysterious Sigil

### Session 62

A few weeks after returning from rescuing Dinia from the Havoc Host, [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) is still waiting for a response to his inquiry regarding the mysterious sigil associated with his village's disappearance and the Umbral Covenant, sent to Archivist [Lyra](<../../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>) in [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>). The city guards bring [Blue](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/blue.md>), human with blue skin and strange eyes, who claims to be carrying a message for [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>), to the [Tempest Towers](<../tempest-towers.md>). Blue turns over [the letter](<../handouts/letter-from-chardon-for-samso-on-the-umbral-covenant.md>), which she has opened and read, and mentions she is also interested in tracking down the Umbral Covenant. After reading and discussing, the party uses [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>)'s Transport via Plants to go back to his hometown -- still abandoned -- and make their way to the city of [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), where [Lyra](<../../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>) has suggested that folk tales and legends might provide more clues than official scholarly works. 

From Urkabi, the [Silver Tempests](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) travel down the [Zurrua](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/zurrua.md>) river, on [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>)'s boat summoned by the Staff of the Swamplands, finding a place to camp for the night as best they can. The next morning, with Samso's spells restored, they turn to wind and travel to [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), where the party splits up. [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>), emerging on the docks, wanders through taverns spreading money around. At The Sober Seal, he hears about [Isabetta](<../../../people/chardonians/isabetta.md>), a popular singer at the [The Drunken Dolphin](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/the-drunken-dolphin.md>), who might have interesting folk legends to tell. [Blue](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/blue.md>) hids in an alley, and accidentally mugs a drunk sailor. [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>), transformed into Marigold, an old woman, finds two kids, Camile and Arturo, who have fled trouble upriver, and helps find them jobs at The Whale's Spout, where the owner, Old Leo, has made a habit of taking in orphans. [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) finds a library, but ends up annoying Niccolo, the librarian, and stealing books in wild shape. 

Regrouping at The Laughing Gull for the evening, the party discusses what they learned. Adrik picked up numerous legends of Yeshara, also called the wolf queen or the wolf-eyed queen, who seemed to have lived in this area many, many years ago along with her people. The stories say that Yeshara was afraid of the dark, and used some kind of magic to create an eternally vigilant, sleepless army, called the Shemra Azem. According to folk tales, Yeshara and the Shemra Azem were behind many of the wars in this region, including the War of the Dark Rift, the War of the Severed Dreams, and ~First Shadow War~ dating all the way back to the Drankorian Era. These folk tales speak of a Drankorian fortress that imprisoned Yeshara. The official histories, however, disagree, considering the Umbral Covenant, the antagonists in the War of the Dark Rift, to be different from the enemies in previous wars. From [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>), the party learns that a sleeping sickness is killing people, still, in villages in the Kedron valley, and some villages mysteriously vanish. 

The next morning, after talking some more with Old Leo, the party decides to travel upriver and investigate the rumored Drankorian fort. With wind walk, the journey is quick, and the party camps in a ravine about five miles from the entrance to the fort to rest before the assault. 

The entrance to the fort is guarded by a extensive wall. The party attacks the defenders, with [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) as a giant elephant providing a platform for [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) to leap onto the wall from. While the elephant is pinned down by minions, [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) pushes enemies off the top of the wall, and [Blue](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/blue.md>) lands a crucial paralysis spell on a shadow knight guarding the gates, as well as a fireball to clear the knight's soldiers. [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>) strikes the knight with a critical hit smite, and [Alton](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/alton.md>), on a draconic spirit summoned by [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) rains arrows on the battlefield.

Although the hard fight, the party fights through the gates. [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>) searches the ruins of the fort beyond with their arcane eye. While most of the standing buildings are ruined, and the party does not do a careful search, there are ancient Drankorian scrolls in the administrative records building. Investigation reveals that many of these are instructions for locking the portal and closes the soul compass. 

Traveling deeper into the ravine from the Drankorian fort, the finds a sealed door, decorated with an incantation to Yeshara and the sleepless vigil, blocking passage. Although not locked, the party is reluctant to touch the door; [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>) sees a vision of Yeshara's face, with no eyelids, who speaks in their mind saying "I see you, intruder. Cairn Dor will consume you." Still, the party must continue and so they pass through the door. All who pass, however, are cursed and unable to sleep. 

On the other side, they see the remains of an ancient village, with wolf-headed stone plinths in two parallel lines leading to a longhouse. Two soldiers emerge from the longhouse, and speak of taking [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>) to Cairn Dor to join the dreamers. The party quickly attacks, and defeats the soldiers without trouble. Afterword, attempting to retreat for a short rest, several of the [Silver Tempests](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>), including [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>) and [Alton](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/alton.md>), cannot pass back through the sealed door. When [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) tries to drag [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>) through, the psychic toll shreds their mind, consuming their knowledge of the guidance cantrip. During the rest, [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>) sees a vision of a young girl emerging from the longhouse, and speaking to them as if they are someone named Illanar, talking about how Illanar will not wake and it is scaring Yeshara, her mom.

After a rest, the party continues down the increasingly dark ravine, passing murals depicting Yeshara leading her people through and under a trilith stone, as part of some rite. Continuing down this passage, the party reaches a large room, with a trilith stone in the middle, several stone plinths with obsidian and bronze mechanisms on them surrounding it, and a greenish sigil glowing on the ceiling matching the symbol [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) found in his village years ago. The party engages in battle, as the soldiers guarding the Cleaver-Stone and the portal to Cairn Dor threaten to drag them through the portal to become dreamers and help the Yo'nari. The battle is challenging. [Blue](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/blue.md>) attempts to disintegrate and enemy, and fails; [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>) is clearly targeted by many of the enemies and eventually falls unconcious and is dragged through the portal. [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>) hides as an earth elemental, taunting the enemies. In the end [Adrik](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) runs through the portal to rescue [Mabist](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>), and [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>)'s desperate, moonlight-enhanced attacks take down the commander, while [Blue](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/blue.md>), attempting to hide with invisibility, produces a wild magic surge of bright light and is knocked unconscious. 

Still, at the end, the party emerges victorious by the skin of their teeth. With the enemies defeated, they use the instructions from the Drankorian administrative building to lock the portal and shut down the soul compass, presumably stopping, at least for now, further raids and disappearances. However, the [Silver Tempests](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) are in no shape to immediately run through the portal seeking [Samso](<../../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>)'s people. 

Instead, they limp back to [Castrella](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), where they pay to have the sleepless curse removed by a priest of [Mos Numena](<../../../gods-and-religions/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>), and regroup at The Laughing Gull before plotting their next move.

The Great Library Campaign tells the story of the adventures of the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>), set primarily in the [Northern Provinces](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/northern-provinces.md>) of the [Chardonian Empire](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>), around the town of [Voltara](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>) and its environs. 

You might start with:
- The [Chronicles of the Silver Tempests](<./great-library-adventures.md>), which describes the events of the campaign
- The [timeline of events](<./great-library-timeline.md>).
- The description of [Tempest Towers](<./tempest-towers.md>), the home base of the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) in [Voltara](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>)

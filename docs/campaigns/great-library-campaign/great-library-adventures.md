# The Chronicles of the Silver Tempests

Herein lies the chronicles of the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>), from their humble roots as hired adventurers for the [Great Library](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>), to their current fame.

## The Elemental Scrolls
*The Silver Tempests get their start as hired hands for the Great Library.*

The first major adventure of the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>), before they acquired their wealth and fame, was in service of the [Great Library](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>), hired by Archivist [Lyra](<../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>) to recover the lost elemental scrolls, that had been created by a famous wizard, [Airion Mistspeaker](<../../people/other-humans/airion.md>), before the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), but lost during the chaos of the [Blood Years](<../../events/1500s/blood-years.md>). They eventually recovered all four scrolls for [Lyra](<../../people/chardonians/lyra.md>), and built a name for themselves. Along the way, they helped some [centaurs](<../../species/unusual-species/centaurs.md>) with a curse; helped the soul of Xameia of the Order of Twilight find peace; helped Iara, a lizardfolk woman; and made enemies of the [orcs](<../../species/orcs.md>) of [Grumella's Horde](<../../groups/orc-hordes/grumella-s-horde.md>). 

This full story is told in the [Chronicles of the Quest for the Elemental Scrolls](<session-notes/great-library-session-notes-arc-1.md>).

## The War Against Grumella
*The Silver Tempests prove crucial to the defeat of Grumella's orc horde and establish themselves as the heroes of Voltara.*

With the recovery of all four of the Elemental Scrolls of Airion, the party enjoyed the status and wealth that comes from success and a growing reputation. Unfortunately, along the way, they made enemies, most notably [Grumella](<../../people/orcs/grumella.md>), an orc warlord with an eye to conquest. Faced with an ultimatum to surrender or be destroyed, the party turned their eyes to the defense of [Voltara](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>), recruiting allies far and wide. This endeavor culminated in the Battle of Voltara, during which [Grumella](<../../people/orcs/grumella.md>) was defeated. The party was celebrated as heroes of the city in victory. 

This full story is told in the [Chronicles of the War Against Grumella](<session-notes/great-library-session-notes-arc-2.md>)

##  The Cursed Cold
*The Silver Tempests venture forth and make a name for themselves among the dwarves of Zarkandur.*

Celebrated as heroes in [Voltara](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>) after providing [crucial contributions to the defense of the city](<session-notes/great-library-session-notes-arc-2.md>) against [Grumella's Horde](<../../groups/orc-hordes/grumella-s-horde.md>), the party basks in their new-found fame, enjoying the manor they are gifted by [Anton Lavernia](<../../people/chardonians/anton-lavernia.md>), Proconsul of Voltara, in thanks for their aid. Once the [legions](<../../groups/chardonian-organizations/chardonian-legion.md>) arrive from the south to reinforce the city, though, the party turns to their next challenge: worries from [Brelith](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>)'s parents back home in [Zarkandur](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/zarkandur.md>) about dwarven cities succumbing to a cursed cold. The party makes their first long journey, east to the dwarven kingdom of [Am'khazar](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/am-khazar.md>), passing dangers and meeting the Deno'qai of [Raha](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/raha.md>) along the way. In the [Sentinels](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range.md>) above [Am'khazar](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/am-khazar.md>), they discover a hag, along with her frost giant allies, is behind the spreading cold. The party defeats the hag, realizing she is the very same one who traumatized [Adrik](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/adrik.md>) as a child, and returns to [Zarkandur](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/zarkandur.md>) as heroes. 

This full story is told in the [Chronicles of the Quest to Defeat the Cursed Cold](<session-notes/great-library-session-notes-arc-3.md>).

## The Silver Tempests Ascendant
*The Silver Tempests grow into a powerful force to be reckoned with, defeating a dragon, a beholder, and an aboleth.*

Fresh off their victory over the hag Morgana Stoneclaw, the party, now calling themselves the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>), finds themselves facing some of the more terrible monsters of the land. While returning to [Voltara](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>), they learn a black [dragon](<../../species/unusual-species/dragons.md>) is disrupting the [Northern Provinces](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/northern-provinces.md>), causing conflict between the ~Voltara East Border Fort~ and a local [bullywug](<../../species/unusual-species/bullywugs.md>) population. Proving their growing power, the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) kill the dragon, Nymthrax, and loot the riches of its lair. Returning to [Voltara](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>), they leave to explore the ruins far beneath Goldpeak Mountain, (re)uniting with some Chardonian explorers and finding the lair of a beholder, Vilaxes. Defeating the beholder, the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) return to [Voltara](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>), extremely wealthy and in need a long break, during which [Brelith](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/brelith.md>) opens a restaurant and retires. Their break is interrupted, however, by the arrival of [Mabist](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/mabist.md>) with the news that Dinia has been captured by the Havoc Host. The [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) ride forth in anger, freeing Dinia from the control of an aboleth, Ithuâ€™rax, near the village of Suwi.

## Extraplanar Mysteries
*The Silver Tempests turn their sights beyond the Material Plane*

After months of waiting, clues to the mysterious disappearance of Urkabi, [Samso](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/samso.md>)'s village, arrive with a new traveler, [Blue](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/blue.md>). The [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) set off to the south to investigate, traveling to the city of [Castrella](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), and then into the mountains on a hunt for Yeshara, the wolf-eyed queen of a shadowy realm called Cairn Dor. Fighting through shadowy enemies, the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) find a portal to Cairn Dor called the Cleaver-Stone, as well as a series of stone plinths that form a soul compass, facilitating the theft of mortals from the [Material Plane](<../../cosmology/material-plane.md>) to serve as dreamers for the Shemra Azem, the sleepless, every-vigilant army of Cairn Dor. With the aid of clues found in the old Drankorian fortress guarding this place, the [Silver Tempests](<../../people/pcs/silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>) shut down the portal and the soul compass, but retreat to [Castrella](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>) to regroup before venturing into Cairn Dor itself.

The first letter reads:

Captain:

I have been asked to draft this letter to you about recent activities along the Enst. At the request of [Marcel de Valarin](<../../../people/sembarans/marcel-de-valarin.md>) myself and several members of the Rangers have investigated further the cause of the Bogblight. I am sure you are aware that the garrison of Cleenseau under your predecessor was instrumental in containing it. As many have suspected, it did not cross Adderfell and come from the Plaguelands. There appears to be a local source. I will spare recounting the many days we spent searching the waterlogged towns west of Beury, although if you see Lord Philip Murtha, please pass along our gratitude for his kindness and endless hospitably. But in the end we backtracked and discovered the true source: a portal to the fey realms appears to exist in the ancient woods north of Cleenseau. Be wary of this! We crossed over, and it is a gloomy place. We followed a track past a dead tree, in the half-light of late afternoon under ponderous dark clouds and heavy skies. How different from the poems my people tell of lands where golden sunlight reflected off trees  endlessly in bloom filled the air with richness! We soon found a ruined labyrinth guarded by a hooded creature with enormous horns, like a stag. Our attempts to negotiate did not end successfully, but swords can sometimes solve problems words cannot. We feared staying further after our clash, and retreated through the portal. 

Marcel believes this was Duskmire, the land of the Lord Umbraeth, and recalls the Oracles warning his people of some bad blood between the Lady of the Evening Mist and Lord Umbraeth, many *ka* ago, and I have no reason to doubt him. 

The Rangers have undertaken to watch this portal, and Marcel says his order will send someone as well, if one can be spared. Be cautious in the woods, and report any sightings of fey to [Adèle Laurent](<../../../people/sembarans/adele-laurent.md>) of the Rangers, in Rinburg, or myself. I can be reached by letter to Marcel in Valarin or [Oswald Greensborn](<../../../people/sembarans/oswald-greensborn.md>) in the [Barony of Vaubonne](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/borderlands/barony-of-vaubonne.md>).

P.S. We found two shambling mounds lurking west of Beury. I beg you to send patrols more often.

The second letter reads:

Captain:

I must away south, Oswald has reported an unusual hobgoblin incursion south of Adderfell, and he has asked my help. I dash this note to supplement my verbal report to your sergeant, and wish you much joy with your new bride. The portal seems to have closed, thank the Star and Tree. I saw one of the hooded creatures stalking around one evening, and feared other dangers might abound. But it seems the danger has passed. I have left word with your sergeant for how to find the portal, and I suggest you patrol the area when you can.  But the danger seems to be past us.

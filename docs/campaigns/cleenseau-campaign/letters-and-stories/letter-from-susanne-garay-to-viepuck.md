title: Letter from Susanne Garay to Viepuck
---

Although the business opportunity you present is fascinating, I must insist that you desist from claiming a relationship to me. These actions are insulting and harm my reputation. My agent will be in Cleenseau soon to discuss a finder's fee for the spider silk idea and will take over all business.

The lord of Cleenseau, Lady Essford, is known to me by reputation as quite fair. I have informed her of my concerns and will defer any actions in response to your misdeeds to her wisdom.

If I hear that you have impersonated my son again I will have you killed.

Yours in trust,
Susanne Garay

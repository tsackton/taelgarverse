An order from the Oracle of the Red:

Warlocks of Ethlenn serving in the Radiant Alliance, please head these orders while west of Fellburn. 

Do not enter the Feywild. There are few portals, unlike home. Avoid them.

Do not negotiate or bargain with the [Gloomshaper](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lord-umbraeth.md>) or his servants, the [Duskhounds](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/duskhounds.md>). These creatures cannot cause true harm unless you follow them into the Feywild. You will recognize them by their shadowed faces and elaborate horns. Flee, if you can. Endure, if you cannot. DO NOT negotiate or agree to their demands.

Be cautious around portals, the [Gloomshaper](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lord-umbraeth.md>) is quick to anger and was banished for his mistreatment of mortals. Give aid wherever possible, when compatible with your other orders.

So ordered on this day, the 23rd of May, in the first year of Cece I's reign
Aethric, Oracle of the Red

- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Unique Mundane Telescope__  
   Created October 1st, 1719 (29 years ago)  
   Created by [Brot Starsearcher](<../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>), in [Taviose](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/taviose.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-cleenseau.md>)

A clever spyglass that [Brot Starsearcher](<../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>) gave to [Izgil](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>) after he promised to seek funding for Brot's large telescope project.

Functions as a spyglass with better than usual field of vision.

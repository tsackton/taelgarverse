This website is the campaign bible for the Cleenseau Campaign, a set in the world of Taelgar, a magical shared world developed by my brother and I. 

Please note that some information here is intended to be for certain players only. That information will be in a spoiler warning block, like so:

>[!INFO]- Delwaths's Background (For Mike's Eyes Only)
> Some secret information about Delwath.

When you see this, please don't expand the spoiler block unless you are the target player.

You most likely want to start with the NPCs, session notes, and other information about the [Cleenseau Campaign](<./cleenseau-campaign.md>). Then you might want to read about [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) and [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), two of the major realms. Or you might want to read about the religion of [Mos Numena](<../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena.md>) or just explorer the [Gazetteer](<../../gazetteer/gazetteer.md>). 

For more information about mechanics and other world background for players specifically, see the [Player's Guide](<../player-s-guide.md>). We have a [house rules document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yVZ-wvLodiXYqgxTJCLqjPWtgJBmd9kNPK7-YVML1Ew/edit#heading=h.o36t6owema04) and a [party loot document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-LoEf5ddTwTO3LwS4oW8D2tpVK5rwzbiPwBnROLus3k/edit#heading=h.xnigrp14kb5p) on Google Drive as well.

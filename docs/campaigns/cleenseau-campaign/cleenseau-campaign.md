The game begins in late October in the year 5852 since the birth of the world, as the [dwarves](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) count, or as the year is more usually known in [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), 7 Robert I, the 7th year of King [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>)'s reign. Scholars of the ancient [Drankorian Empire](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) would say the year was DR 1719 and many across The Green Sea Region would use those count of years.

In [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), the summer has been bad. The monsoon rains which usually arrive in April and bring nurturing rain in gentle measure from the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) came late, and when they did come, brought downpours and flooding. A diplomatic envoy from [Zovcka](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkovia/zovcka.md>) was found murdered in her bedchamber while visiting the king in [Embry](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/embry.md>), and [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) mishandling the resulting crisis, insulting the pride, and worse, the ancient gods of the highland kingdom.

In [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), [Elaine II](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/elaine-ii.md>) rules uneasily. On the death of the great [Queen Cece I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>), seven years ago, all expected the royal electors of [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), the [Oracles of the Riven](<../../groups/oracle-of-the-riven.md>), to elector her only surviving son, [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>), of the reigning [House of Sewick](<../../groups/sembaran-noble-houses/house-of-sewick.md>), as they had for a generation. Instead, they elected [Elaine II](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/elaine-ii.md>), a cousin of [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) and a descendant of [Cynan](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cynan.md>) the great king of [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>). She is popular in [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), and not coincidentally, the current heir to the throne of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) should [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) die without issue.

Rumors do spread about her resemblance to her famous great-great-grandmother, [Elaine I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/elaine-i.md>), who like her, was a queen of [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>) before becoming queen of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) and whose reign was marred by great disuptes over succession. Despite that, the land is peaceful, and the scars of the [hobgoblin](<../../species/goblinoids/hobgoblins.md>) wars of two generations ago are healing, and mostly forgotten. 

The action begins just outside the market town of [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>).

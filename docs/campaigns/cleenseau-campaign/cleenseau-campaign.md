{title: Cleenseau Campaign}

The game begins in late October in the year 5852 since the birth of the world, as the [dwarves](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) count, or as the year is more usually known in [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), 7 Robert I, the 7th year of King [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>)'s reign. Scholars of the ancient [Drankorian Empire](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) would say the year was DR 1719 and many across The Green Sea Region would use those count of years.

In [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), the summer has been bad. The monsoon rains which usually arrive in April and bring nurturing rain in gentle measure from the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) came late, and when they did come, brought downpours and flooding. A diplomatic envoy from Zovcka was found murdered in her bedchamber while visiting the king in [Embry](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/embry.md>), and [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) mishandling the resulting crisis, insulting the pride, and worse, the ancient gods of the highland kingdom.

In [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), [Elaine II](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/elaine-ii.md>) rules uneasily. On the death of the great [Queen Cece I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>), seven years ago, all expected the royal electors of [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), the [Oracles of the Riven](<../../groups/oracle-of-the-riven.md>), to elector her only surviving son, [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>), of the reigning [House of Sewick](<../../groups/sembaran-noble-houses/house-of-sewick.md>), as they had for a generation. Instead, they elected [Elaine II](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/elaine-ii.md>), a cousin of [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) and a descendant of [Cynan](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cynan.md>) the great king of [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>). She is popular in [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), and not coincidentally, the current heir to the throne of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) should [Robert I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) die without issue.

Rumors do spread about her resemblance to her famous great-great-grandmother, [Elaine I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/elaine-i.md>), who like her, was a queen of [Tyrwingha](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>) before becoming queen of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) and whose reign was marred by great disuptes over succession. Despite that, the land is peaceful, and the scars of the hobgoblin wars of two generations ago are healing, and mostly forgotten. 

The action begins just outside the market town of [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>).

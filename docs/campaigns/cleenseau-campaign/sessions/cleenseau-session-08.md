The session begins around noon, after having spoken with [Wymar Essford](<../../../people/sembarans/wymar-essford.md>) and [Rinault Essford](<../../../people/sembarans/rinault-essford.md>) about their memories of town history. The party splits up:

* [Izgil](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>) investigates the basement of Essford Manor. After some digged and cleaning with prestidigitation, he finds a large granite slab covering what appears to be a secret entrance to the underground ruined fort
* [Robin](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) investigates the garrison. Although there are no meaningful records, [Walter](<../../../people/sembarans/walter-of-cleenseau.md>) although a bit grumbly upon being awakened, warms to Robin's gentle insistence that Walter's knowledge will be extremely helpful, and ends up sharing several stories of the hobgoblin wars and in particular the recapture of Cleenseau. He won't let Robin leave until he promises to accompany Walter to Walter's favorite sweet shop
* [Es*tiasilos](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/estiasilos.md>) investigates the ruined fort south of the [Enst](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) but discovers little there
* [Viepuck](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) and [Celyn](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) investigate Tumbledown Farm and follow up on Cedric the missing pregnant transman. The eventually discover, with the help of Eliana that he was ill the previous night, and find signs he fell into the river (likely in some distress given the blood and vomit). Viepuck also finds evidence of a rat hole beneath Tumbledown Farm and sends [Es*tiasilos](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/estiasilos.md>) to investigate

The party regroups outside [Aulout](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/aulout.md>) as Gideon Thorne, one of the main fishermen in [Aulout](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/aulout.md>) and the father-in-law of [Beatrix](<../../../people/sembarans/beatrix-of-cleenseau.md>) has sounded the horns. There, they discover Cedric's dead and zombie-fied baby. Abundant caution prevents any additional harm, beyond the tragedy of Cedric and his unborn child's death.  In the meantime [Es*tiasilos](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/estiasilos.md>) investigates the rat hole, and finds a warren. One zombie-fied rat he manages to kill, and two others he avoids. He additionally finds an exit at the Gracien house, neighbor to [Beatrix](<../../../people/sembarans/beatrix-of-cleenseau.md>) and the [Thorne's](<../../../people/sembarans/jon-thorne.md>). Finally, he discovers that the rat warren exits into some buried basement, as well as a large, oddly constructed tunnel. While investigating this, the party discovers that one of the Thorne's was bitten by a rat a few days ago, but is getting better. Robin's investigation suggests a magical infection of some kind, which the teenager fought off.

That evening, the party dines, along with a crowd of well-wishers and worrying townsfolk, and [The Crossroads Inn](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/the-crossroads-inn.md>). While [Robin](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) entertains [Lord Rinault](<../../../people/sembarans/rinault-essford.md>), [Viepuck](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) and [Celyn](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) discuss the past with [Marigold Stonebridge](<../../../people/halflings/marigold-stonebridge.md>). She shares some history of the inn, including its base as an underground railroad of sorts for humans fleeing hobgoblins. The next morning, the party descends into the tower.

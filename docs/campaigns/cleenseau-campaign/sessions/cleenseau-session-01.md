Our session begins on a rainy evening in October with the party scattered -- [Celyn](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) and [Viepuck](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) at the [The Fox's Flagon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/the-fox-s-flagon.md>) and [Izgil Moonseeker](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>) and [Robin of Abenfyrd](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) camped on the [South Watch Road](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/roads/south-watch-road.md>).

[Celyn](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) and [Viepuck](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) play dice for a bit in the evening, and hear some rumors about the [tragic flood](<../../../events/1700s/1719/10/tragic-flood-of-the-river-enst.md>). In the morning, [Celyn](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) wanders to the fields on the north side of town while Najeer heads to [Taviose](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/taviose.md>) to discuss something mysterious with [Brot Starsearcher](<../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>). 

[Izgil Moonseeker](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>) and [Robin of Abenfyrd](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) encounter each other on the road, just for long enough to say hello, when they spy the [First Spider Attack on Tavoise](<../../../events/1700s/1719/10/first-spider-attack-on-tavoise.md>) in progress.

The party meets in [Perrin's](<../../../people/sembarans/perrin-voclain.md>) house after the spider attack, and introduces themselves. [Izgil Moonseeker](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>) is here seeking [Brot Starsearcher](<../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>) and their particular expertise in telescope making. [Robin of Abenfyrd](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) is looking for a bridge, and [Celyn](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) is drifting on the wind, he says. [Viepuck](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) also seems to have some business with [Brot Starsearcher](<../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>) but what it is is not clear.

The party's discussion is broken up by the arrival of [Ysabel](<../../../people/sembarans/ysabel.md>), who thanks them profusely and invites them to come stay at the [Essford Manor](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/essford-manor.md>), the keep of the [Lord of Cleenseau](<../../../people/sembarans/wymar-essford.md>). After accepting her invitation, the party meets [Brot](<../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>) and discusses the lunar surface and telescopes. Izgil offers to fund [Brot's](<../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>) research as his family, the [Gemcrafters](<../../../groups/clans/gemcrafters.md>), are a wealth trading family from [Nidzahar](<../../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/nidzahar.md>). [Brot](<../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>) also gives [Izgil](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>) a [working scale model of their telescope design](<../treasure/brot-s-telescope-small.md>). Izgil has some further private conversation with [Brot](<../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>), and the party eventually heads to the manor to have dinner.

The dinner is a quiet and awkward affair as none of the Essford family attends. [Rosalind Essford](<../../../people/sembarans/rosalind-essford.md>) is in mourning for her lost children, as is her husband [Arthur Bybet](<../../../people/sembarans/arthur-bybet.md>). Her younger brother, [Rinault Essford](<../../../people/sembarans/rinault-essford.md>) has ridden upriver seeking information about the [the flood](<../../../events/1700s/1719/10/tragic-flood-of-the-river-enst.md>), and her father [Wymar Essford](<../../../people/sembarans/wymar-essford.md>) is unwell. The only bright point is when after dinner [Robin](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) plays his lute, which everyone finds quite moving. He is accompanied competently (just) by [Celyn](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) on the drums.

At the dinner the party does meet a number of town notables: [Ysabel](<../../../people/sembarans/ysabel.md>), the sheriff; [Jonathon Henwyn](<../../../people/sembarans/jonathon-henwyn.md>), the steward; [Anselm](<../../../people/sembarans/anselm.md>), the administrator of [the Warlod's Temple](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/temple-of-the-warlord-in-cleenseau.md>); [Eremon](<../../../people/sembarans/eremon.md>), an acolyte of [The Night Queen](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-night-queen.md>) and confident of the Essford family; [Conrad](<../../../people/sembarans/conrad.md>), [Anselm's](<../../../people/sembarans/anselm.md>) assistant, and [Sarabeth](<../../../people/sembarans/sarabeth.md>), a senior guardswoman and veteran of the [Army of the West](<../../../groups/sembaran-army/army-of-the-west.md>). 

The party is awoken in the pre-dawn with news of the [Second Spider Attack on Tavoise](<../../../events/1700s/1719/10/second-spider-attack-on-tavoise.md>) and the session ends as the investigation completes and the party debates what to do next.

> [!INFO]- Izgil's Conversation with Brot (Matt Only)
>Izgil and Brot mostly discuss telescopes but Brot does take Izgil aside at one point and whisper that he should ask Najeer about the egg. What that means isn't very clear, but Brot does warn Izgil that Najeer might not want to discuss it.

> [!INFO]- Celyn's Experience (Kiya Only)
> When Celyn first saw Robin, he saw a ghostly vision, like some type of echo riding behind him of a man in armor painted with the sigil of the Wildling, with a fey look about it. It fades rapidly. Additionally, when Robin takes out his lantern for the first time, he sees a circle of golden leaves as a echo around the lantern, and for a brief moment it even seems like the sun is setting inside the lantern.

# KenkuÂ Species Details

Kenku are a species of humanoid birds, sometimes called the birdfolk. Feathered wings sprout from their backs, giving them the ability to fly. Most kenku make their home in the cold open plains and mountains of the far north, and few talk about their history or origin to outsiders. Still, kenku can often be seen along the cities, towns, and villages of the [Green Sea](<../../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), although few cross the mountains to the western coast of Taelgar.

## Kenku Traits

As a Kenku, you have these special traits.

#### Flight
You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. 



#### Disguised Form
When you reach character level 5, you can transform yourself with a Bonus Action, selecting one of the options below (choose the option each time you transform). The transformation lasts for a number of hours equal to your Proficiency Bonus, unless you choose to end it early (no action required). Once you transform, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest. 

Here are the transformation options:

**Masked Mind.** While the transformation lasts, you cannot be targeted by divination magic, or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

**Masked Body.*** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance.

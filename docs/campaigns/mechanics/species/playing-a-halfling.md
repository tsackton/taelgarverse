{title: Playing a Halfling}
---
Halflings in Taelgar are noted for their extreme wanderlust, uncanny ancestral memory that sometimes means they can remember people they've never met, and silent speech when they talk amongst themselves. Cheerful and friendly with outsiders, but private and protective of their kin and traditions, halfling traders, wanderers, and storytellers keep the world connected. 

## Mechanics

Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.
#### Ability Score Increase
Increase one ability score of your choice by 2, and a different ability score by 1. Or, increase three different ability scores by 1.
#### Age
A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives to around 100. 
#### Size
Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
#### Speed
Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
#### Lucky
When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
#### Memory of the Ancestors
Halflings can telepathically seek a connection to the collective memory of their ancestors. When you make an ability check that involves recalling knowledge (one that uses History, Religion, Nature, or Arcana, or additional checks at the DM's discretion), you can choose to enter a 1 minute trance, during which you infuse yourself with the collective racial knowledge of halflings, allowing you to roll **1d6** and add the result to the triggering ability check. You may choose to enter this state after you roll the **d20**, but before you know the results of the check. In this state, you are only semi-aware of the outside world, and have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses after a long rest. 
#### Silent Speech
You can speak telepathically to any creature within 120 feet of you, as long as you can see them or are aware of their presence. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language, although if you don't share a language you can communicate emotions and images. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.
#### Halfling Talent
Halflings are generally small, quick, charming and adaptable wanderers. You may choose one of the following talents to represent your halfling heritage.

- _Adaptable._ You have a knack for picking up new things. You gain your choice of two proficiencies, which can be simple weapons or tools. In addition, the amount of downtime required for you to gain proficiency in a tool is reduced by half.
- _Agile._ You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
- _Charming._ You can use a bonus action to project a minor telepathic aura. Choose one creature you can see. You gain advantage on the next Charisma check you make involving this creature, as long as that check occurs within the next 10 minutes. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
- _Fearless._ You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
- _Nimble._ You can use your Dexterity modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, for any Strength check to climb, swim, or jump. This does not change your default jump distance.
- _Polyglot_. You have a knack for picking up new languages. You learn two additional languages. In addition, the amount of downtime required for you to learn a new language is reduced by half.
#### Wanderer
In your travels, you have picked up your choice of one additional language or tool proficiency.

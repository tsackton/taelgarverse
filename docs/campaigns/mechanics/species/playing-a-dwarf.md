title: Playing a Dwarf
---
[Dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) in Taelgar are one of the Elder Folk, divinely created by the [Bahrazel](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>), the dwarven gods and Firstborn of their race. Bold, brave, and tradition-bound, as skilled in artistry as in battle, deeply committed to clan and home, [dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) are among the most common of the Elder Folk in Taelgar. Squat and often bearded, the first [dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) built majestic underground cities of light and splendor. While many [dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) still dwell in their ancestral mountain homes, they have spread around the world and are one of the more common Elder Folk seen in the cities of [humans](<../../../species/humans/humans.md>) in Taelgar.

Dwarves, no matter where they live, have a mystical connection to the Bahrazel, that deepens when they reach adulthood and complete the rite of name-taking, becoming part of a thuhr. There are seven thuhr, each associated with one of the Bahrazel: Ruler, Runecrafter, Priest, Farmer, Stoneworker, Traveler, and Warrior. The thuhr function as a combination of guild, mentorship organization, found family, and secret society, creating ties between clans.

To create your dwarf character, consider your relationship with your thuhr and the [Bahrazel](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>). Some dwarves have a deep and abiding connection to their thuhr, to the extent it may replace the bonds of clan and family; for others, their thuhr may have opened doors to apprenticeships or training; for yet others, it may be simply part of the background noise of their lives. You are free to decide how significant or insignificant your thuhr is as you roleplay your character. 

All dwarves have also have a connection to the [Bahrazel](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>), as this is what grants you your rune magic trait, described below. The guiding principle of Dwarven religion is based around a set of obligations and debts to the divine, in exchange for power and favors, that is almost feudal in nature. It is up to you how much you want to make this part of your character: while some dwarves feel a particular connection to one of the Bahrazel, many dwarves are not particularly religious. Even divine magic users may not be particularly devote in dwarven society; the Bahrazel work in mysterious ways, and may grant divine power for their own purposes to even the most unlikely dwarf. 
# Dwarven Traits

**Creature Type:** Humanoid.
**Size**: Medium (typically between 4-5 feet tall)
**Speed**: 25 feet, which is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

As a dwarf, you have the following special traits:

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Dwarven Training.*** All dwarves are blessed by the Bahrazel with skill in crafts and war. You learn two proficiencies of your choice, which can be artisan's tools or simple weapons, to represent this innate training. You may replace one of these proficiencies with proficiency in a martial weapon.

***Stonecunning.*** As a Bonus Action, you gain Tremorsense with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes. You must be on a stone surface or touching such a surface to use this Tremorsense. The stone can be natural or worked. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

***Dwarven Rune Crafting.*** As an adult dwarf who has completed your pilgrimage to the Heart of the Mountain, you gain an innate ability to use runes to create magical effects, drawing power from your connection to the Bahrâzel. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can mark one weapon, set of armor, piece of clothing, or other object you touch with a rune you know. The rune persists on the marked object until you mark a new object or die. The runes you can learn are described in your thuhr. You may choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your ability score for rune effects.

***Thuhr.*** As adult dwarf, you belong to one of seven thuhr: Ruler, Runecrafter, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, Farmer. Your thuhr does not limit your choice of class or profession. Rather, it reflects your role and place in dwarven society. You thuhr gives you magical traits, in the form of knowledge of a rune granted by your connection to the Bahrâzel.

>[!note] Binthuhr Dwarves
>If you are a binthuhr dwarf (a young dwarf who has not visited the Heart of the Mountain, or an adult who failed to complete their pilgrimage), you do not have a thuhr or the dwarven rune crafting trait. You may instead choose one 1st level feat to reflect your upbringing.

## Thuhr
### Ruler
Dwarves of the Ruler thuhr have a special connection to Uzdan, the Bahrazel said to be first king of the dwarves. This thuhr is among the least common in dwarven society; many of the dwarves in this thuhr end up in positions of leadership, whether clan heads or battle commanders.

As a member of the Ruler thuhr, you know one of the following Runes: the [Rune of Truth](<./playing-a-dwarf.md#dwarven-rune-optionsrune-of-truth>) or the Rune of Valor.
### Runecrafter
Dwarves of the Runecrafter thuhr have a special connection to Karthel (he/him), the Bahrazel said to be the originator of runic magic. Many librarians, scribes, and researchers come from this thuhr; powerful rune-mages, although rare in dwarven society, are also almost always in the Runecrafter thuhr.

As a member of the Runecrafter thuhr, you know one Rune from the list of Dwarven Rune Options.
### Priest
Dwarves of the Priest thuhr have a special connection to Fanrukel (she/her), the Bahrazel worshipped as the first lorekeeper of the dwarves. Many members of the Priest thuhr have roles that emphasize a connection to dwarven history or religion.

As a member of the Priest thuhr, you know one of the following runes: the Rune of Lore, or the Rune of Life.
### Warrior
Dwarves of the Warrior thuhr have a special connection to Azar (he/him), the Bahrazel worshipped as the strongest warrior and original defender of the dwarven race. While members of the Warrior thuhr have diverse roles in society, it is a common thuhr among the soliders of the dwarven armies.

As a member of the Warrior thuhr, you know one of the following runes: the Rune of Defense, or the Rune of Valor.
### Stoneworker
Dwarves of the Stoneworker thuhr have a special connection to Tarbaka (she/her), the Bahrazel worshipped as the first crafter of the dwarves. Many artisans and craftsfolk are of the Stoneworker thuhr.

As a member of the Stoneworker thuhr, you know one of the following runes: the Rune of the Forge or the Rune of Stone.
### Farmer
Dwarves of the Farmer thuhr have a special connection to Oshkir (he/him), the Bahrazel worshipped as the first teacher of the dwarves and the provider of the dwarven race. Many members of the Farmer thuhr are  drawn towards farming and other callings associated with food production, they also are associated with healers, caregivers, educators (especially of younger dwarves), and teachers. 

As a member of the Farmer thuhr, you know one of the following runes: the Rune of Life or the Rune of Aid.
### Traveler
Dwarves of the Traveler thuhr have a special connection to Maganna (she/her), the Bahrazel worshipped as the first miner and explorer of the dwarves. Members of the Traveler thuhr often are drawn to roles that take them outside of cities, whether deep underground to find new mines and sources of mineral wealth, or aboveground to the lands of the other races.

As a member of the Traveler thuhr, you know one of the following runes: the Rune of Delving or the Rune of Exploration.
## Lifespan
Dwarves, like many of the Elder Folk, are exceptionally long lived, with a typical lifespan of 250-300 years. Dwarves reach physical maturity in their 20s, but are not considered adults until they undertake their pilgrimage to the [Heart of the Mountain](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>) and participate in the rite of name-taking, usually in their mid-30s. Dwarves are not considered old until their second century, and some elders of the race have been known to live past 350. Despite their long age, dwarves tend to have relatively few children, and most dwarven families are small, often with widely-spaced siblings. 

As a dwarven adventurer, you can pick any age you prefer. Dwarves younger than 80 or so would often be considered young; dwarves older than 200 would often be considered old. 
## Dwarven Names
A dwarf’s name is revealed to them when they find the Heart of the Mountain, and holds a deep place in the traditions of clan and thuhr. All dwarf names are used and reused over centuries and revered down the generations. Young dwarves who have not made their pilgrimage yet go by diminutive nicknames given by their parents (these names tend to be one syllable and are genderless in Dwarf society). Dwarven clan names are traditionally translated to Common when outside dwarven settlements, but you may make a different choice for your character if you choose.

title: Playing a Lizardfolk
---


[Lizardfolk](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) live in widespread communities, sometimes primarily with their own species, sometimes near other races. They are semi-aquatic, and rarely make their homes far from water, however. 
## Lizardfolk Traits
#### Age

Lizardfolk reach adulthood in their early 20s; the first 8-10 years of their life are spent as amphibious young. Most live into their third century, but few live beyond 300 years.

#### Size

Lizardfolk are generally a little taller and bulkier than humans, and their tails give them the appearance of an even larger size. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Aquatic Adaptations

You have a swim speed of 30 feet, and you can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at at time.

#### Favor of the Ancestors

You may ask the Tharzen Anzinakoa to give you an omen about the results of a specific course of action you plan to take in the next hour. This requires prayer and meditation for 10 uninterrupted minutes. If you are outside, touching the ground, and can see the sky, this requires no material components; otherwise, it requires a relic or other focus of your homeland. The Tharzen Anzinakoa will respond with one of four answers: 

- Weal, for good results
- Woe, for bad results
- Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
- Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad

Their answer does not take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you ask two or more questions before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. This roll is made in secret.

#### Natural Armor

You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

#### Spiritual Affinity

The lizardfolk connection to the Tharzen Anzinakoa manifests differently in each individual, as spiritual affinity. Choose one of the following affinities, which grants you additional benefits.

- _Land._ You have an affinity for the natural spirits of the land. You can communicate in a limited manner with beasts and plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them.
- _Ancestors._ Your affinity for the spirits of your ancestors imbues you with knowledge. You gain proficiency in the History skill, and when you make a Intelligence (History) check involving the history of the Lizardfolk, you may add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of your normal ability bonus, to the roll.
- _Beasts._ You have an affinity for the spirits of the wild animals of the hunt, who give power to your bite. You can use your fanged maw as natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
- _Dreams._ You have an affinity for the spirits that inhabit the dreamworld. You have the ability to briefly see a moment ahead in time. Before you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you may choose to glimpse into the dreamworld and see the possible answers and paths forward. This gives you advantage on the roll. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or a long rest.

#### Tharzen Anzinakoa's Blessing

In addition to your spiritual affinity, the Tharzen Anzinakoa and the ancestor spirits of your clan grant you a special boon when you come of age. You may choose one of the following blessings.

- _Blessing of Animals._ You can cast Animal Friendship with this trait. Once you cast this spell with this trait, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
- _Blessing of Mists._ You can cast Fog Cloud with this trait. Once you cast this spell with this trait, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
- _Blessing of Hunters._ You can cast Longstrider with this trait. Once you cast this spell with this trait, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
- _Blessing of Nature._ You can cast Locate Animals and Plants with this trait. Once you cast this spell with this trait, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

---

[Humans](<../../../species/children-of-divine-creation/humans/humans.md>) are the most common species in Taelgar, far outnumbering any other sentient beings. Humans are also exceptionally diverse -- unlike many other species in Taelgar, they live across the world, inhabiting all climates, with a bewildering variety of languages and cultures.

To create your human character, you can choose to use either the traits below, or use the standard or variant human traits from the Players' Handbook.

Creature Type: Humanoid  
Size: Medium (about 4–7 feet tall) or Small (about 2–4 feet tall), chosen when you select this species

As a Human, you have these special traits. 

**Resourceful**. You gain Inspiration whenever you finish a Long Rest.
**Skillful**. You gain Proficiency in one Skill of your choice.  
**Versatile**. You gain the Skilled Feat or another 1st-level Feat of your choice. First level feats are described in the [Character Origins UA (pdf)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/character-origins/CSWCVV0M4B6vX6E1/UA2022-CharacterOrigins.pdf)

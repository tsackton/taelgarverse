title: Playing a Centaur
---

[Centaurs](<../../../species/children-of-the-divine/centaurs/centaurs.md>) in Taelgar are descended from the archfey, but have made their home on the world of Taelgar. Many [centaurs](<../../../species/children-of-the-divine/centaurs/centaurs.md>) see themselves as protectors and guardians of the world, and centaur societies tend to be nomadic, rarely staying in one place for more than a year. 

To create your centaur character, consider your relationship to your people, and society. Did you come from a typical centaur society, a wandering group of migratory folk? If so, what prompted you to leave and go adventuring? How do you feel about other species? Do you adopt the typical distaste for permanent construction of your people, or do you have different attitudes?
# Centaur Traits
**Creature Type:** Fey
**Size**: Medium (typically between 6-7 feet tall)
**Speed**:40 feet

As a centaur, you have the following traits:

_**Charge.**_ If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves.

_**Equine Build.**_ You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

_**Hooves.**_ You have hooves that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals **1d6** + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

_**Natural Affinity.**_ Your fey connection to nature gives you an intuitive connection to the natural world and the animals within it. You therefore have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: [Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling), [Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine), [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature), or [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival).
# Lifespan
Centaurs have lifespans that are similar to humans. Centaur young are born able to walk and survive independently, but otherwise mature at the same rate as humans. 


# Backgrounds
Consider one of the following sample backgrounds for your centaur, or create your own. Note that feats marked with a * in sample backgrounds are from Unearthed Arcana documents. 
## Hunter
**Ability Scores.** +2 Dexterity, +1 Wisdom
**Skill Proficiencies.** Stealth, Survival
**Tool Proficiency.** Herbalism Kit
**Language.** Sylvan
**Feat.** Alert

You served your people in your youth as a hunter, traveling far from your kin, hunting and tracking game. On the frontier, you learned to be alert to danger, reading the signs of your prey, hiding when needed. The quiet time, waiting in ambush, trained you to always be ready for anything. 
## Storyteller
**Ability Scores.** +2 Charisma, +1 Intelligence
**Skill Proficiencies.** History, Performance
**Tool Proficiency.** Musical instrument of your choice
**Language.** Elvish
**Feat.** Musician

You spent your youth learning the stories and oral histories of your people, and learning to set them to song. Perhaps you trained with an elder centaur in your society, or even traveled far from home to learn music and song from reclusive elves. You learned to inspire your companions with song and story. 
## Prophet
**Ability Scores.** +2 Wisdom, +1 Intelligence
**Skill Proficiencies.** Nature, Insight
**Tool Proficiency.** Gaming Set of your choice
**Language.** Primordial
**Feat.** Magic Initiate (Primal)*

You can read the signs of prophecy in the land, either a natural gift, or a hard won skill learned at the feat of a master of your people. Your connection to the land has given you the ability to lightly tap the magic of Taelgar itself. 
# Languages

When you create your character, you may choose two [languages](<../../../species/languages.md>) in addition to those granted by other sources. One of these will usually be Common, also known as Westros, a widespread trade tongue in the western part of Taelgar. The other will usually be Centaur, unless you grew up outside of normal centaur society.

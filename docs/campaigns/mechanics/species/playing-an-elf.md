title: Playing an Elf
---

Elves were the first of the Elder Folk to walk the earth, imbued with magic and power in the younger days of the world. They do not die of old age, although many tire of the world, and it is rumored that some of the first elves, created by the Gods, still walk the earth. The elves of Taelgar have also faced tragedy and loss, suffering and dying in cataclysmic wars that have shaken the world. Now, they are few in number and rarely seen, and some have turned inward, disavowing their ancient roles as protectors of Taelgar. Few elves live amongst the other species. 

Elves in Taelgar are also notable for the unique cycle of generations. There is only a 30 year period in every 160 years where new elves are born, creating a count of generations going back to the first elves, that the elves number. The most recent *ka*, the 37th, was born approximately 120-150 years ago.

To create your elf character, consider first your age and your generation, or *ka*. If you were born in the 37th *ka*, you are likely between 120 and 150 years old. Many elves of this age are encouraged to leave their home, travel, explore, so this is a natural choice for an adventurer. If you wish to be older, consider what has made you an adventurer later in life. Consider also where you are from, and your relationship with your kin and other species. 

A simple answer if engaging with the lore of elves is not of interest to you is that you came from an isolated elven kingdom (the kingdom of [Orenlas](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/orenlas.md>)  is a good choice), were born in the 37th *ka* and are now spending the years of your life before you decide whether to return to your home traveling and adventuring. 

## Elven Mechanics

#### Size

Elves are usually between 5 and 6 feet tall, weighing somewhat less than a Human of the same height. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Darkvision

Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Trance

Elves do not sleep, and cannot be put to sleep by magic. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in this trance-like meditation, during which you retain consciousness. 

#### Fey Resistance

You have advantage on saving throws against disease, are unaffected by mundane illnesses.

#### Keen Senses

You are proficient in the Perception skill

#### Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.

#### Elven Experience

You have lived in the world for many years and acquired training as a result. You gain three proficiencies of your choice, which can be languages, tools, or weapons. You cannot select more than two martial weapon proficiencies with this trait.

#### Firstborn's Gift

You have an innate understanding of the weave of magic from your connection to Elmerca, the Wild Star, and Aldanor, the Living Tree. You choose one of the following talents.

- _**Fey Craft.**_ You have a natural ability to manipulate the weave of magic at will. You can use this ability to innately cast one cantrip from the Wizard spell list. For you, this cantrip requires only verbal components. You can choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting ability score for this spell.
- _**Mask of the Wild.**_ You can use your connection to magic to manipulate natural phenomena. You can attempt to hide even when only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, snow, mist, dim light, or other natural phenomena. You can also ignore difficult terrain caused by nonmagical plants (such as heavy undergrowth) or weather (such as heavy snow).
- **_Blessing of the Sea._** You can breath air and water, and gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed. Aquatic animals have an extraordinary affinity with you. You can communicate simple ideas to any Beast that has a swimming speed. It can understand your words, though you have no special ability to understand it in return.

#### Elven Ritual Magic

Your innate connection to the weave of magic allows you to learn one ritual from among the choices below. You can perform this ritual at will, but to do so requires that you spend 10 minutes concentrating (as if concentrating on a spell), while you meditate and chant softly to invoke this feature. The effects produced by these rituals are treated as 1st level spells for the purposes of dispel magic or other effects that act on spells, but as expressions of the pure energy of the Plane of Magic they do not have a school of magic.

- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Protection.**_ You can surround yourself with the protective energy of the Wild Star. For the next 8 hours, your AC is equal to 13 plus your Dexterity modifier.
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Sight.**_ You can sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you, even if hidden from sight. One foot of stone, one inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks this sense. If you sense magic using this ability, you can use your action to perceive a faint aura around any creature or object bearing magic within range, and can learn its school of magic or equivalent, if relevant. Elmerca's Sight lasts while you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 30 minutes.
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Knowledge.**_ As part of the ritual to invoke Elmerca's Knowledge, you touch an object or creature. At the conclusion of this ritual, you can perceive currents of magical energy that cling to the target. If it is magical, you learn this, and also learn its properties, how to use them, whether the item requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has (if any), although certain hidden or masking properties may not be revealed. If the object was created by a spell, you learn this and what spell created it. If it is otherwise imbued with magic, you learn this and also what spells are affected it. At the DM's discretion, and if the target is an object, you may also be able to see a glimpse or two of its past, or learn a piece of its history, especially if it was near to or part of an event that involved particularly powerful magic.
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Awareness.**_ As part of the ritual to invoke Aldanor's Awareness, you describe or name one specific kind of animal or plant. At the conclusion of the ritual, Aldanor grants you knowledge of the distance and direction to the closest creature or plant of that kind, as long as it is within 5 miles of your location.
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Speech.**_ You are granted a measure of the speech of the Living Tree. For 30 minutes, while you maintain concentration, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts.
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Ward.**_ As part of the ritual to invoke Aldanor's Ward, you must trace by touch or walking an area no larger than a 20 foot cube. When the ritual is complete, this area is protected by Aldanor's grace. You are alerted if any creature, except those you designate during the ritual, enters or touches the warded area as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the ward. If you are asleep, you are awakened by this alarm. The ward lasts for 8 hours.

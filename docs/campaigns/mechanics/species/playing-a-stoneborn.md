title: Playing a Stoneborn
---

The [Stoneborn](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/stoneborn/stoneborn.md>) in Taelgar are a reclusive species. They tend to live in isolated communities in extreme environments, especially high in the mountains, although they are not unheard of in human and dwarven settlements. They are also noted in the world of Taelgar as master artisans, skilled in many trades. It is not uncommon for individual [Stoneborn](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/stoneborn/stoneborn.md>) to spend decades, or even a century, honing their craft. 

To make a [Stoneborn](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/stoneborn/stoneborn.md>) adventurer, consider why you left your community. Perhaps you are a rare member of your species born among other sentient beings, in a human city, or among dwarves, or even elves. Maybe you left your home on a personal mission, or on a mission for your clan. Maybe a tragedy -- or a personal mistake -- forced you to leave. 

Use the following traits when you create your Stoneborn character:

#### Size
Stoneborn are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 450 pounds. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Disciplined Training
You discipline and training grants you one of the following choices: proficiency in the [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival) skill, proficiency in the [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics) skill, or mastery (allowing you to add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of your normal proficiency bonus) with one artisan's tool of your choice.

#### Entamba's Blessing

As a Stoneborn, you can use your connection to Entamba to perform feats of strength, endurance, and mental stamina. You may select one of the following disciplines:

- _Entamba's Endurance (Stoneborn only):_ You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
- _Entamba's Dance (Sandborn only):_ You learn to mimic the shifting sands and blowing winds of your desert home. Your base movement speed increases to 35 feet. In addition, when a creature targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature's attacks against you to be rolled with disadvantage until the start of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until after you finish a short or a long rest.
- _Entamba's Force:_ As a bonus action, you can focus yourself to strike with supernatural power. The next time you hit with a weapon attack, the attack deals 2d6 additional force damage to the target, and if the target is a creature, it must make Strength saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus, or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone. The extra damage dealt by this ability increases to 3d6 at level 5, 4d6 at level 11, and 5d6 at level 17. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
- _Entamba's Calm:_ Your connection to Entamba strengthens your will. You have advantage on all Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against magic. In addition, you do not need to sleep: meditating for four hours is sufficient to restore your mind and body, giving you the same benefit as a human resting for 8 hours.
- _Entamba's Body:_ Your connection to Entamba gives you a degree of control over your metabolism. You gain resistance to poison damage, have advantage on saving throws against poison, and need half as much food and water as normal. In addition, as an action you can put yourself in a state that appears as if you are dead to casual inspection, which lasts until you use a bonus action to wake yourself up. While in this state, you can hold your breath twice as long as normal, and do not need to eat or drink. You are also incapacitated and have disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks. Once you use this ability to feign death, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. 

#### Mountain Home
You’re at home in the high mountains. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Survival) check while traveling in the mountains, you are considered proficient in the Survival skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. You also suffer no ill effects from cold environments, and are acclimatized to high elevation, as described in chapter 5 (p. 110) of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

#### Powerful Build
You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

#### Skin of Stone
You are able to channel the power of the mountains to harden your skin. You may substitute your Strength modifier for your Dexterity modifier to calculate your AC if you are unarmored or wearing light armor.

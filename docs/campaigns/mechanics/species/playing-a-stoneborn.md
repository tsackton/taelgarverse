## Creating Your Stoneborn Character



To make a [Stoneborn](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/stoneborn/stoneborn.md>) adventurer, consider why you left your community. Perhaps you are a rare member of your species born among other sentient beings, in a human city, or among dwarves, or even elves. Maybe you left your home on a personal mission, or on a mission for your clan. Maybe a tragedy -- or a personal mistake -- forced you to leave.

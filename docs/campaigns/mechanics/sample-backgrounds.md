## ACOLYTE

Ability Scores: +2 Wisdom, +1 Intelligence 
Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion  
Tool Proficiency: Calligrapher’s Supplies 
Language: Celestial
Feat: Magic Initiate (Divine)

You devoted yourself to service in a temple, either nestled in a town or secluded in a sacred grove. There you performed hallowed rites in honor of a god or pantheon. You served under a priest and studied religion. Thanks to your priest’s instruction and your own devotion, you also learned how to channel a modicum of divine power in service to your place of worship and the people who prayed there.

## ARTISAN

Ability Scores: +2 Intelligence, +1 Charisma 
Skill Proficiencies: Investigation, Persuasion 
Tool Proficiency: Artisan’s Tools* (one of your choice) 
Language: Stoneborn 
Feat: Crafter

You began mopping floors and scrubbing counters in an artisan’s workshop for a few coppers per day as soon as you were strong enough to carry a bucket. When you were finally old enough to apprentice, you learned to create basic crafts of your own, as well as how to sweet-talk the occasional demanding customer. As part of your studies, you picked up Stoneborn, the tongue from which so many of the artisan’s terms of art are derived.

## CHARLATAN
Ability Scores: +2 Charisma, +1 Dexterity
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Sleight of Hand
Tool Proficiency: Forgery Kit
Language: Infernal
Feat: Skilled

Soon after you were old enough to order an ale, you already had a favorite stool in every tavern within ten miles of where you were born. As you traveled the circuit from public house to watering hole, you learned to prey on the unfortunates who were in the market for a comforting lie or two—perhaps a sham potion or a forged “treasure map.” You are fluent in Infernal, the ancient language of deception.

## CRIMINAL
Ability Scores: +2 Dexterity, +1 Intelligence
Skill Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth
Tool Proficiency: Thieves’ Tools
Language: Thieves’ Cant 
Feat: Alert

You learned to earn your coin in dark alleyways, cutting purses or burgling shops. Perhaps you were part of a small gang of like-minded wrongdoers, who looked out for each other. Or maybe you were a lone wolf, fending for yourself against the local thieves’ guild and older, more fearsome lawbreakers.

## CULTIST
Ability Scores: +2 Intelligence, +1 Charisma
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Religion
Tool Proficiency: Disguise Kit
Language: Abyssal
Feat: Magic Initiate (Arcane)

You scarcely recall what drove you into the service of the otherworldly being. Those memories were blotted out long ago by recurrent dreams of midnight gatherings round the obsidian pillar in the glade. By the light of each waning moon, the hierophants instructed you in the being’s creed and the rudiments of the arcane arts. When you came of age, you were ordered to blend in among the nonbelievers and await whatever mission the Great One has in store for you.

## ENTERTAINER
Ability Scores: +2 Charisma, +1 Dexterity
Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance
Tool Proficiency: Musical Instrument* (one of your choice)
Language: Elvish
Feat: Musician

You spent much of your youth following roving fairs and carnivals, performing odd jobs for musicians and acrobats in exchange for lessons. You may have learned how to walk a tightrope, how to double pick a lute, or how to recite Elvish poetry with the impeccable trills of an elf poet. To this day, you thrive on applause and long for the stage.

## GUARD

Ability Scores: +2 Strength, +1 Wisdom Skill 
Proficiencies: Athletics, Perception 
Tool Proficiency: Gaming Set* (one of your choice) 
Language: Dwarvish 
Feat: Alert

Your feet begin to ache when you remember the countless hours you spent at your post in the tower. You were trained to keep one eye outside the wall, watching for marauders sweeping from the nearby forest, and your other eye inside the wall, searching for cutpurses and troublemakers. At the end of each shift, you bunked in the mayor’s barracks alongside your fellow sentries and the dwarven smiths who kept your armor snug and your weapons sharp.

FARMER
Ability Scores: +2 Constitution, +1 Wisdom
Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Nature
Tool Proficiency: Carpenter’s Tools
Language: Halfling
Feat: Tough
You grew up close to the land. Years tending
animals and cultivating the earth rewarded you
with patience and good health. You have a keen
appreciation for nature’s bounty alongside a
healthy respect for nature’s wrath. Like many
farmers, you made frequent use of the
agricultural almanacs produced by the greatest
halfling farmers.

GLADIATOR
Ability Scores: +2 Strength, +1 Charisma
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Performance
Tool Proficiency: Smith’s Tools
Language: Orc
Feat: Savage Attacker
Your first few appearances in the gladiatorial
pits led you to appreciate every one of the scars
you carry from your instructors and sparring
partners. Each scar was a lesson that taught you
how to best your opponents and curry favor
with the crowds your brawls entertained. Your
time in the pits left you with a strong hand and
a strong heart. You’ll forever share a
remarkable bond with the other pit fighters in
your stable—humans, dragonborn, dwarves,
and orcs—hardened warriors all.

GUIDE
Ability Scores: +2 Wisdom, +1 Dexterity
Skill Proficiencies: Stealth, Survival
Tool Proficiency: Cartographer’s Tools
Language: Giant
Feat: Magic Initiate (Primal)
You came of age in the outdoors, far from
settled lands. Your home? Anywhere you chose
to unfurl your bedroll. There are wonders on
the frontier—strange monsters, pristine forests
and streams, overgrown ruins of great halls
once trod by giants—and you learned to fend
for yourself as you explored them. From time to
time, you traveled with a pair of friendly druids
who were kind enough to instruct you in the
fundamentals of channeling the magic of the
wild.

Language: Sylvan
Feat: Magic Initiate (Primal)

Ability Scores: +2 Charisma, +1 Intelligence
Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion
Tool Proficiency: Gaming Set* (one of your

Language: Draconic
Feat: Skilled

You spent your early years secluded in a hut or
monastery located well beyond the outskirts of
the nearest settlement. In those days, your only
companions were the creatures of the forest,
who would occasionally visit to bring news of
the outside world and supplies. The quiet and
solitude you found in your time outside society
allowed you to spend many hours pondering
the mysteries of creation, attuning your mind to
the magical energy flowing through the natural
world.

LABORER
Ability Scores: +2 Constitution, +1 Strength
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival
Tool Proficiency: Mason’s Tools
Language: Dwarvish
Feat: Tough
Your apprenticeship consumed the better part
of your youth. First, you learned to cut and
polish a stone. After several years of polishing
stones, you learned how to cement those stones
into a wall. After several years building walls,
you learned to join your walls to form a
structure. The structures you built were
exceptionally durable. The masons who taught
you were taught by even older masons who
were taught by dwarf artisans of old.

You were raised in a castle as a creature of
wealth, power, and privilege—none of it earned.
Your family are minor aristocrats who saw to it
that you received a first-class education, some
of which you appreciated and some of which
you resented. (Was it truly necessary to read all
those ancient histories in their original
Draconic?) Your time in the castle, especially
the many hours you spent observing your
family at court, also taught you a great deal
about leadership.

Ability Scores: +2 Wisdom, +1 Constitution

Tool Proficiency: Musical Instrument* (one of

Language: Halfling
Feat: Healer
You and a group of like-minded believers—
mostly humans and halflings—once endeavored
to walk a thousand miles of road to reach a
faraway shrine. Priests counseled at the outset
that, long after your journey was complete,
you’d come to realize that you found the key to
your salvation not at your destination, but
somewhere along the road that led there.

SAGE
Ability Scores: +2 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, History
Tool Proficiency: Calligrapher’s Supplies
Language: Elvish
Feat: Magic Initiate (Arcane)
You spent your formative years traveling
between manors and monasteries, performing
various odd jobs and services in exchange for
access to their libraries. You wiled away many a
long evening with your nose buried in books
and scrolls, learning the lore of the multiverse—
even the rudiments of magic—and your mind
only yearns for more.

Tool Proficiency: Gaming Set* (one of your
choice)
Language: Goblin
Feat: Savage Attacker
You began training for war at such an early age
that you carry only a precious few memories of
what life was like before you took up arms.
Battle is in your blood. Sometimes you catch
yourself reflexively performing the basic
fighting exercises you learned as a youth.
Eventually, you put that training to use on the
battlefield, protecting the realm by waging war
and studying the strategies of goblinoid
generals.

Thus far, you’ve spent most of your days living

barstools in more ports of call than you can
remember, faced down mighty storms, and
swapped stories with the folk who live beneath
the waves.

You grew up on the streets, surrounded by
similarly ill-fated castoffs, a few of them friends
and a few of them rivals. You slept where you
could and did odd jobs for food. At times, when
the hunger became unbearable, you resorted to
theft. Still, you never lost your pride and never
abandoned hope. Fate is not yet finished with
you.

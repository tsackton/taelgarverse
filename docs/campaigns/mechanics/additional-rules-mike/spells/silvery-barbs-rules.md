### Silvery Barbs
*(1st level Enchantment)*

**Casting Time**: 1 Reaction (which you take when a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw)
**Range/Area**: 60 feet
**Components**: V
**Duration**: Instantaneous

You magically distract the triggering creature. The triggering creature must reroll the d20 and use the new roll, if it is lower.

*Interactions with Advantage and Disadvantage*: This spell is triggered when something succeeds; the new roll is not rolled with Advantage or Disadvantage.

# Sanctuary
Level 5 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite: Ability to use a Holy Symbol or Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus
Space: Roomy 
Hirelings: 1  
Order: Craft (1d4 BP)

Icons of your religion are displayed in this facility, which includes a quiet place for worship or spiritual practice. 

The Sanctuary imparts the following benefit:
## **Cast Healing Word**.
You can draw on the power of your Sanctuary to heal yourself or another. After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you can cast Healing Word once within the next 7 days without expending a spell slot. The spell’s level is half your level,
rounded down. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until the next Bastion turn. 

When you issue the Craft order to this facility, it produces a sacred focus:
## **Craft: Sacred Focus**. 
You commission the facility’s hireling to craft a Druidic Focus (Wooden Staff) or a Holy Symbol. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The item remains in your Bastion until you claim it, or you can have it sold for 5 GP.
# Greenhouse
Level 9 Bastion Facility
Prerequisite: None 
Space: Roomy 
Hirelings: 1  
Order: Harvest (1d6 BP)

A Greenhouse is a spacious enclosure where rare plants and fungi are nurtured in a controlled climate.

## Ki plants
One plant in your Greenhouse has three magical fruits growing on it. Any creature that eats one of these fruits gains the benefit of a Lesser Restoration spell. Fruits that aren’t eaten within 24 hours of being picked lose their magic. The plant replaces all picked fruits daily at dawn, and it can’t be transplanted without killing it.

When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

## **Harvest: Healing Herbs.** 
You commission the facility’s hireling to create a Potion of Healing (Greater) made from healing herbs, or you do the work yourself. The work takes 7 days and costs nothing.

## **Harvest: Poison**. 
You commission the facility’s hireling to extract one application of an ingested poison from rare plants or fungi, or you do the work yourself. Choose the type of poison from the following options: Midnight Tears, Pale Tincture, Torpor, or Truth Serum. See the “Poisons” section in the Dungeon Master’s Guide for each poison’s effect. Once harvested, the poison can be contained in a vial. The work takes 7 days and costs nothing.

# Garden

Level 5 Bastion Facility

Prerequisite: None 
Space: Roomy 
Hirelings: 1  
Order: Harvest (1d4 BP)

A Bastion can have more than one Garden. Each time you add a Garden to your Bastion, choose its type from the following options:

*Decorative Garden.* This aesthetically pleasing Garden is full of flowers and topiaries.
*Food Garden.* Delicious mushrooms or vegetables are grown here.
*Herb Garden*. This Garden contains rare herbs, some of which have medicinal uses.
*Poison Garden.* This Garden is stocked with plants and fungi from which poisons and antitoxin can be extracted.

While in your Bastion, you can instruct the facility’s hireling to change the Garden from one type to another. This work takes 21 days, during which time no other activity can occur in this facility.
## Harvest
When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, you commission the facility’s hireling to collect items of value from the Garden as noted in the Garden Harvest table. The work takes 7 days and costs you no money.

| Type       | Harvest |
|------------|---------|
| Decorative | The Garden produces either ten exquisite floral bouquets or ten vials of Perfume. Each of these can be sold for 5 GP. |
| Food       | The Garden produces mushrooms and vegetables that are sold to earn you 50 GP. |
| Herb       | The Garden produces herbs that are used to create a Potion of Healing. |
| Poison     | The Garden produces plants that are used to create either two vials of Antitoxin or one vial of Basic Poison. |

***Enlarging a Garden.*** You can enlarge your Garden to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. A Vast Garden is equivalent to two Roomy Gardens, and can include two of the same type of garden or two different types. When you issue the Harvest order to a Vast Garden, each component garden produces its own harvest. A Vast Garden gains 1 additional hireling.

# Trophy Room

Level 9 Bastion Facility
**Prerequisite:** None  
**Space:** Roomy  
**Hirelings:** 1  
**Order:** Research (1d6 BP)

This room houses a collection of mementos, such as weapons from old battles, gifts from benefactors, the mounted heads of slain creatures, trinkets plucked from dungeons and ruins, and trophies passed down from ancestors.

When you issue the Research order to this facility, choose one of the following options:
### Research: Lore.
You commission the facility's hireling to research a topic of your choice, or you do the research yourself. The topic can be a legend, any kind of creature, or a famous object. The topic need not be directly related to items on display in the room, as the trophies provide clues to research a wide variety of other subjects. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, you obtain up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to you. The DM determines what information is learned.
### Research: Trinket Trophy.
You commission the facility's hireling to search for a trinket that might be of use to you. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, roll a die. If the number rolled is odd, the hireling finds nothing useful. If the number rolled is even, the hireling finds a trinket with a previously unknown magical property. You can decide what the trinket looks like or roll on the Trinkets table in the *Player's Handbook* to determine its form. As a Magic action, a creature can use the trinket to cast a particular spell, requiring no spell
components. Choose the spell from the following list: Clairvoyance, Death Ward, Find Traps, Locate Creature, Magic Weapon, Remove Curse, or Speak with Dead. Once used in this way, the trinket loses its magic.

# Training Area

Level 9 Bastion Facility
**Prerequisite:** Expertise in a skill, Fighting Style feature, or Unarmored Defense feature  
**Space:** Vast  
**Hirelings:** 4  
**Order:** Empower (1d6 BP)

A Bastion can have more than one Training Area. A Training Area might be an open courtyard, a gymnasium, a music or dance hall, or a cleverly built gauntlet of traps and hazards. It might contain inanimate targets (for weapon practice), padded mats, and other equipment. One of the facility’s hirelings is an expert trainer; the others serve as training partners. When a Training Area becomes part of your Bastion, choose one trainer from the Expert Trainers table. On each Bastion turn, you can replace that trainer with another one from the table.
## Empower
When you issue the Empower order to this facility, the facility’s hirelings conduct training exercises for the next 7 days. Any character who trains here for at least 8 hours on each of those days gains a benefit at the end of the training period. The benefit depends on which trainer is present in the facility, as noted in the Expert Trainers table. The benefit lasts for 7 days.
## Expert Trainers
| Trainer               | Training Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Battle Expert         | Once per turn, when you take damage from an attack made with an Unarmed Strike or a weapon, you can reduce this damage by 1d4, provided you don’t have the Incapacitated condition.                                                                                     |
| Skills Expert         | You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Performance, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.                                                                                                                                    |
| Tools Expert          | You gain proficiency with one Musical Instrument or Tool of your choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Unarmed Combat Expert | When you use an Unarmed Strike to damage a target, the attack deals an extra 1d4 Bludgeoning damage on a hit.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Weapon Expert         | Choose a type of Simple or Martial weapon, such as Spear or Longbow. If you aren’t proficient with the weapon, you gain proficiency with it for the next 7 days. If you already have proficiency with the weapon, you can use its Mastery property for the next 7 days. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

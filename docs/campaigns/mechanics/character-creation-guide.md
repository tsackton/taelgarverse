The world of Taelgar is an extensive homebrew world, the setting for several campaigns run by both myself and my brother. Currently, Taelgar uses the 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons rules, supplemented with homebrew. 

To create your character, you will need to do the following, in any order:
- Determine ability scores. We use point buy or standard array (player's choice). 
- Pick a species (see the Species section, below)
- Choose a class. Generally any published class or subclass from any sourcebook is fine, excluding partnered content (Critical Role and Magic: The Gathering books). We use D&D Beyond for character sheets; you should have an invitation to a campaign with content sharing. Ask if this isn't working for you. 
- Pick a background. We use the [Character Origins UA (pdf)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/character-origins/CSWCVV0M4B6vX6E1/UA2022-CharacterOrigins.pdf) for backgrounds and 1st level feats. The ability score increases in your background replace the ability score increases granted by your species. We modify these backgrounds to allow a choice of two tool proficiencies, two languages, or one of each. These backgrounds currently require homebrew on D&D Beyond; ask if you need something created for you.
- Pick languages 

You can review the [Player's Guide](<../player-s-guide.md>), with lore notes, and the living document of [house rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l2cPIqR7gkvSppYeM6ZBl7Mbf-Sd6qhRyW4HNuwnxfU/edit) as well. 
## Species

Taelgar has extensive homebrewed species options, that exist in various stages of revision. Some have been playtested more extensively than others.

Playable species include the following, listed in order of unusualness:
- [Humans](<species/playing-a-human.md>), the most common species across Taelgar, with a variety of diverse cultures and religions.
- [Elves](<species/playing-an-elf.md>), [Dwarves](<species/playing-a-dwarf.md>), [Lizardfolk](<species/playing-a-lizardfolk.md>), [Stoneborn](<species/playing-a-stoneborn.md>), and [Halflings](<species/playing-a-halfling.md>), known as the Elder Folk, the creations of the embodied gods, the Firstborn of their people. While Halflings, Dwarves, and Lizardfolk are relatively common travelers among human cities, and can frequently be encountered far from their homelands, Elves and Stoneborn are rare, and many commoners will have never met a member of these species before. 
- The various [Fey](<species/playing-a-fey-species.md>), who are the subject of many wild tales, some true and others not, and while not native to the material plane, are sometimes encountered as visitors to and even residents of human settlements. 
- [Centaurs](<species/playing-a-centaur.md>), fey who have abandoned the feywild and see themselves as the guardians of Taelgar, are not an unusual sight on their travels across human kingdoms, but rarely stay long in human cities. 
- The flying [Kenku](<species/playing-a-kenku.md>), mysterious and secretive, who rarely leave their northern homelands, but are sometimes seen in the human cities and settlements, especially along the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>). 
- The trickster [Kobolds](<species/playing-a-kobold.md>), descendants of dragons, who are known throughout the world, but rarely welcome in human settlements. 

While these are theoretically playable races, they should be discussed as they are either extremely unusual, or usually considered evil by humans:
- Most [Orcs](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) are mystically bound at birth by a ritual to dedicate their lives to violence in the service of Thark, the god of war without end, but rumors persist across the human world of free orcs who have escaped these bonds. 
- Goblins, who were created by a malevolent force to serve their hobgoblin and bugbear masters; those who escape are as likely to be pitied as scorned. 

Species not listed here are not available to choose as playable race in Taelgar by default. If you would like to play something different from the options here, I am open to discuss whether there is a way for this species to fit into the world of Taelgar, without any promises. 
## Backgrounds

Your background consists of the following features:
- **Ability Scores.** When you determine your character’s ability scores, choose two of them, and increase one by 2 and the other one by 1. Alternatively, choose three ability scores, and increase each of them by 1. *These replace the Ability Score increases from your species.*
- **Skill Proficiencies.** Choose two Skills. Your character gains Proficiency in them.
- **Tool Proficiency.** Choose one tool. Your character gains Tool Proficiency with it.
- **Language.** Choose one language. Your character knows that language.
- **Feat.** Choose one 1st-level Feat. Your character gains that feat. 
- **Equipment.** Your character gains 50 GP to spend on starting equipment. The character keeps any unspent GP as spare coin.

You may optionally choose to forgo the **Language** feature, instead choosing a second **Tool Proficiency**, or vice versa.

Some species have sample backgrounds.
## Languages

All characters start with two languages, usually an appropriate trade language and their native tongue. Backgrounds, species traits, and class features can grant additional languages. Rare languages require DM permission to learn, unless this is your native language.

# The Energy Realms

In the Standard Multiversal Model, made famous by the Faculty of Metaphysics at the [University of Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/university-of-chardon.md>), the Energy Realms are the name for the collection of planes associated with the fundamental energies of the multiverse. The traditional model, popularized by Julius Ceptuso, postulates five fundamental energies of matter, Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Magic, each associated with an Energy Realm. Although modern metaphysical cosmologists typically consider Magic to be a fundamental multiversal force and do not include the Plane of Magic within the Energy Realms, the five fundamental energies retain a hold on the population conception. 

This traditional model postulates there are only four (or five, if the Plane of Magic is included) Energy Realms. The strongest argument for this claim comes from the seminal work of the cosmological philosopher Lyrannis of Aquilona, On Elemental Forms, who exhaustively cataloged folklore, myth, and observation considering the nature of elemental beings, with a focus on the sentient and powerful genies. She conclusively shows that the vast majority of creatures with a "pure elemental essence" are associated Fire, Water, Earth, or Air. 
## Alternate Conceptions

### Airion's Compound Elemental Planes

The recent rediscovery of the The Codex of Compound Planes by the famous wizard and elementalist [Airion the Mistspeaker](<../../people/other-humans/airion.md>) calls into question the traditional model, however. Airion devoted his life to the study of the elemental planes, until he was tragically killed in his prime during the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). Much of his work was lost during the [Blood Years](<../../events/1500s/blood-years.md>), but recent efforts by the [Great Library](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>) to recover lost knowledge have paid dividends. In The Codex of Compound Planes, [Airion](<../../people/other-humans/airion.md>) claims, by careful experimentation with planar travel, to have isolated specific metaphysical energies associated with a number of Compound Elemental Realms, which  have traditionally been considered localized regions of the vast Elemental Realms. Airion speaks of at least eight of these Compound Elemental Planes that represent what he calls the secondary energies, to distinguish them from the five fundamental energies. 

He describes:
- [Frostfell](<./frostfell.md>), representing the energy of cold and associated with preservation, a blend of Water and Air
- Pyreforge, representing the energy of heat and associated with transformation, a blend of Fire and Earth
- Miredepths, representing the energy of mud and associated with corruption, a blend of Water and Earth
- Smokeshroud, representing the energy of smoke and associated with concealment, a blend of Fire and Air
- Cloudmere, representing the energy of lightning and associated with transience, a blend of Air and Magic
- Bloomswell, representing the energy of life and associated with growth, a blend of Water and Magic
- Ashspire, representing the energy of death and associated with destruction, a blend of Fire and Magic
- Ironroot, representing the energy of metal and associated with endurance, a blend of Earth and Magic
### The Seven Fundamental Energies of the Dwarves

Dwarven metaphysicists traditionally postulate a model of the Energy Realms based on the ancient theory, supposedly spoken to the first dwarves by the [Firstborn](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>) themselves, of the seven fundamental energies of the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>): Spirit (associated with the Ruler), Magic (associated with the Runecrafter), Earth (associated with the Priest), Air (associated with the Traveler), Fire (associated with the Stoneworker), Water (associated with the Farmer), and Metal (associated with the Warrior).

In this model, the essence of Spirit is associated with the [Heart of the Mountain](<../spiritual-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>), while the other six energies associated with specific Energy Realms, implying the existence of an Elemental Plane of Metal. While Lyrannis of Aquilona dismisses this, citing a lack of evidence of pure metal elementals, empirical metaphysicists have documented descriptions of places -- assumed to be part of the [Elemental Plane of Earth](<./elemental-plane-of-earth.md>) -- that resemble massive twisted caverns of iron, which some theorists believe could instead be the mysterious Elemental Plane of Metal. Others claim that what the dwarves call the Elemental Plane of Metal is in fact Airion's Ironroot and Pyreforge, two of the Compound Realms of the Elemental Plane of Earth. 
### The Eightfold Essences

The lizardfolk mystic Aznoké, in her epic poem _The Endless Currents_, described the Eightfold Essences as the combination of the physical energies (Fire, Air, Earth, Water), the fundamental energies (Magic and Spirit), and the cyclical energies (Life and Death). She speaks of the Plane of Blossoming Currents as the wellspring of vitality, where life flows into being like a river surging forth from its source, representing the cyclical energy of Life. Its counterpart, the Plane of Still Waters, is a tranquil, shadowed realm where the currents of life slow and pool, allowing death to cleanse and prepare for renewal, representing the cyclical energy of Death. While Aznoké's teachings emphasize the unity of these forces within the natural cycle, some scholars in theFaculty of Metaphysics have speculated that they correspond to the hypothesized Positive Energy Plane and Negative Energy Plane, which no planar traveler has yet reached and returned from safely.

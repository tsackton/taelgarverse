No reliable reports of planar travelers have come from the plane known as Limbo. Scattered fragments of lost poems and confused ramblings, collected by Gaius Devarro, hint at a place of churning chaos, where nothing holds its shape for long; stone melts to water, which freezes to fire at a whim, before bursting into a diamond that blows away as snow. Marcion of Iridel, quoting a fragment of a lost treatise called the The Unstable Sphere, called it "the endless unmaking," suggesting a domain of constant, unceasing, chaotic transformation. 

The origins of Limbo defy any explanation, although Yendalo speculated that Limbo may in fact be a shifting wound in reality itself, where the fundamental essences of existence refuse to take any permanent shape.

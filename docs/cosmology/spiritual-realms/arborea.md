Arborea is the plane of untamed nature, a realm where the wilderness is unshaped by civilization, where forests stretch beyond sight, mountains climb past the clouds, and rivers carve ever-changing paths through boundless plains. The most vibrant descriptions of Arborea come from the _Verdant Canticles_, an elven collection of tales and poems, that speak of storms that gallops across the plains like a herd of wild beasts and trees that reach so high their tops fade out of sight in the vast sky. Collected in this work are songs that sing of a paradise of untouched beauty, and warnings of a place where nature is too vast, too alive, too uncontrolled to be anything but overwhelming. What dwells within its endless expanse is unknown: some tales speak of nothing but the wilderness itself, while others whisper of things that walk unseen through the trees, their presence felt in the shifting of leaves and the deep, rhythmic breath of the land.
## Origins of Arborea

There are no firm theories on the origin of Arborea, and the Standard Multiversal Model model is silent as to its creation. However, a common folk theory comes from the theological cosmologist Heloise of Tollen, who, while primarily a student of the [Plane of Creation](<../plane-of-creation.md>), popularized the idea that Arborea arises from the fundamental desire of all creation to live, and it in fact reflects the life essence embedded within all Soulstuff. 


## Influence of Arborea

Places where Arborea brushes against the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>) often teem with unnatural abundanceâ€”forests that stretch taller than they should, flowers that bloom too brightly, fruit that never rots, animals watch with more awareness than they should possess. Myths, such as the tale of a  single acorn that took root overnight and became a towering oak, suggest the wildness inherent in Arborea can leak between planes or from portals. But whether these are mere stories remains unknown. 


These claims are supported by the [experiences](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/session-notes/session-34-dufr.md>) of the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) with the [Extraplanar Weak Point](<../planar-concepts/extraplanar-weak-point.md>) connecting Arborea to the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>) underneath the [Lakan Monastery](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/lakan-monastery.md>), south of [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>).

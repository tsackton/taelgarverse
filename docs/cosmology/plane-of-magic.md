The Plane of Magic is the name given by arcane cosmologists to the source of the fundamental energetic force that powers all arcane magic in the [Multiverse](<./multiverse.md>). Although the Plane of Magic is conventionally depicted as the far nexus of the [Ethereal Plane](<./ethereal-plane.md>), there is no consensus among scholars regarding the exact nature of this plane, or even its basic properties. 

>[!ffaq] Multiversal Models of Magic
>The two most popular multiversal models of the Plane of Magic are the multidimensional web theory of the elven philosopher Avariel, and the sea of energy theory popularized by the proponents of Planar Dualism. 
> #### The Multidimensional Web
> This theory starts from the observation that [Ley Lines](<planar-concepts/ley-lines.md>), presumed to be a manifestation of contact with the Plane of Magic, can be found in all planes that any experimental cosmologist has studied. To Avariel, this implied that while most planes can be thought of as isolated bubbles, sometimes superimposed on one another (as the Material Plane and the [Plane of Souls](<./plane-of-souls.md>) are), the Plane of Magic must be something different. She proposed that the Plane of Magic is best thought of as existing in a higher dimension than other planes, such that it could not be fully modeled in the usual four dimensions of planar geometry, and it would thus contact all other planes.

> #### The Sea of Energy
> This theory derives from the claims of the Planar Dualists that there are only two fundamental planes: the [Astral Plane](<./astral-plane.md>) and the [Ethereal Plane](<./ethereal-plane.md>). In this model, the [Ethereal Plane](<./ethereal-plane.md>) is depicted a vast ocean upon which the rest of the [Multiverse](<./multiverse.md>) floats, with what others might call the Plane of Magic depicted as the deepest shoals. In this model, [Ley Lines](<planar-concepts/ley-lines.md>) are rivers of magical energy, flowing to and through the [Ethereal Plane](<./ethereal-plane.md>), cascading like waterfalls through the [Multiverse](<./multiverse.md>) and ultimately flowing to the deepest wells of magic at the bottom of the [Ethereal Plane](<./ethereal-plane.md>). While Planar Dualism would hardly be considered a dominant multiversal model, the metaphor of the [Plane of Magic](<./plane-of-magic.md>) as a chaotic sea, and [Ley Lines](<planar-concepts/ley-lines.md>) as rivers flowing into is, is popular among many scholars, even among those who reject the claims of planar dualism otherwise. 



Some brainstorming on:
- Discord Chat - Multiverse
- [Ley Lines](<planar-concepts/ley-lines.md>)

Fundamentally, the source of arcane magic. However, the deeper metaphysics are almost entirely a blank slate.

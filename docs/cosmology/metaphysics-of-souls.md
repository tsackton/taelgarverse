# Metaphysics of Souls

When the physical body dies the soul fades quickly from the [Plane of Souls](<multiverse/plane-of-souls.md>), but does not immediately disappear into nothingness, nor immediately gain everlasting life in some outer realm. Instead, most souls drift towards the [Land of the Dead](<multiverse/spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>), a mysterious realm with many different names and descriptions. From the [Land of the Dead](<multiverse/spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>), many souls find their way to some outer realm, of a god, or perhaps the Nine Hells or Arborea or stranger realms. Those not claimed by a god, or similar power, eventually fade away into nothingness, becoming part of the essence of the Land of Dead itself. This journey across the Land of the Dead is usually thought to take about a week, although some cross it faster, or slower, and souls that are lost can linger much longer, it is thought. What happens to those souls who never leave the Land of the Dead is a mystery, although many theories persist: some believe they fade away; others believe they are stuck forever, in a kind of limbo.Â Many cultures believe the Land of the Dead to be dangerous, a place best crossed quickly, and many funerary rituals developed to help souls cross the Land of the Dead. Other cultures are more concerned with the transition from Taelgar to the Land of the Dead. But all cultures know that the gods shepherd souls in some fashion, and that mortal actions can help - or hinder - a soul's journey. 

Some cultures may also be aware of the [Gidari](<../species/children-of-creation/gidari.md>), the soul shepherds, who are tasked (by who, no one knows) with guiding souls safely through the Land of the Dead. These shepherds enforce rules, and are the ones who prevent, say, demon lords from just camping out in the Land of the Dead and consuming souls as they flow past. Some cultures might see them as celestials, representatives of the gods, although the reality is more complicated. Other cultures are completely unaware of their existence.

Those souls which do not enter the Land of the Dead become stuck on the [Material Plane](<multiverse/material-plane.md>), perhaps becoming ghosts.

Amongst humans, there is also an ancient idea, dating back to the first creation of humans on Hkar, that these transitions, and in particular the transition of the soul from the Plane of Souls to a body at birth, and from Taelgar to the Land of the Dead at death, are minor miracles, granted by the gods to each human born. In general, human cultures believe souls are the continuity of the living person, and care deeply about the soul reaching a final resting place.

Other species may have similar, or different, beliefs about the transition of a soul, but broadly share the same metaphysical truths. 





### Necromancy
These metaphysics have implications for how necromancy and undeath is seen, which, although it varies across cultures, has some commonalities. Some types of undead, such as skeletons, ghouls, and zombies are purely animated by necromantic forces. These undead have no relationship to the [Plane of Souls](<multiverse/plane-of-souls.md>) and merely require a physical body. 

Other types of undead, such as ghosts, specters, and wraiths are the disembodied souls, usually of those souls who were lost on the Material Plane (although who knows what magic can do). 

The scariest undead are those where a body and a soul are brought together in undeath. In some cases, these are unwilling - a soul trapped in their own dead body, under control of a necromancer. In other cases, a sentient creature becomes undead willingly. In general though, these undead are rare. 

Most traditions are concerned with ensuring that the soul makes it to the afterlife, which is thought to put it out of reach of any danger, and perhaps, with ensuring the body cannot be animated (for example, by cremation).
### Resurrections
These metaphysics also have implications for resurrection magic as well. In particular, the strength of magic required to return someone to life has a lot to do with where their soul is.

The simplest magic, such as Revivify, only works when the soul has not departed from the Plane of Souls at all, and thus must be used immediately. The stronger magic, such as Raise Dead, can find a soul in the Land of the Dead, but cannot return a soul from the outer realms. This makes it risky, in some ways, without any true guarantee that it will work - for who truly knows how long a soul stays in the Land of the Dead? These things are beyond human ken, and sometimes even powerful magic like Raise Dead fails.

The strongest resurrections - Resurrection and True Resurrection - rare and miraculous, can return a soul to life from anywhere.

In the classical texts of [Mos Numena](<../gods-and-religions/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>)theology that have come down from the days before the [Downfall](<../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>), the Plane of Souls is described as a realm of pure thought, where the sparks of the souls of all sentient beings native to the [Material Plane](<./material-plane.md>) float like constellations. These ancient texts say the Plane of Souls is the connection between the material and the divine, and that each soul that floats in the constellations on the Plane of Souls is a locus for divine miracles. Without the Plane of Souls, in Mos Numenan tradition, we would be mindless constructs. 

While most scholars and theologians accept a version of this depiction, and the theology of the Plane of Souls as the intersection between the material and the divine is common across diverse religious traditions, the fey tell a different tale. According to the theologian Camilla of Drankor, the most prominent ancient scholar of fey cosmology, the fey believe the Plane of Souls is but a pale, distant echo of the vibrant chaos of the [Dreamworld](<./dreamworld.md>). These heretical opinions are not widely accepted by any theological cosmologists, excepting the followers of Yendalism, who persist in claiming that the souls of all denizens of what they call the [Inner Realms](<planar-concepts/inner-realms.md>) are reflected in the constellations of the [Plane of Souls](<./plane-of-souls.md>).

# Halfling Religious Practice



Halflings do not have deep traditions of prayer, or organized religious practice. For many halflings, the First Ones are simply the backdrop to life, the guardians and creators of the racial ancestral mind and memory. Every experience, every memory of a halfling’s life will eventually contribute in some small way to the greater halfling consciousness, and for many halflings simply acknowledging and paying attention to their experience as they go through life is the extent of their worship practice.  

Nonetheless, some religious traditions are common among halfling communities.
## Prayers and Worship

Prayer and worship traditions in halfling culture typically serves to call the attention of the [First Ones](<../gods/embodied-gods/first-ones/first-ones.md>), to ask them to attend with purpose, to help create and preserve strong memories. Prayers for beginnings, and for endings, are often said, and especially prayers to remember those who have passed and ensure their memories are strong. 

History-bearers, those halflings who through practice or divine inspiration have a deeper, and stronger, connection to the racial memory, bear witness to these beginnings and endings, and many halfling prayers are also stories of the past. In this way, the history-bearers serve as a priesthood and to mark occasions.   
## Sacred Places

Halflings build no temples, rarely settling in one place for long enough to be concerned with the construction of physical monuments to the gods. But halfling shrines dot the landscape, often in natural places that capture particular experiences, that evoke the feelings of an aesthetic that embraces life-as-it-is, not life as something artificially made to be perfect. A small, out of the way path off a main trade road, that leads to a particular ravine or grove of tree or waterfall may turn out to be a sacred halfling shrine.


## Afterlife
 
Halflings, when they die, do not long linger as individual, distinct souls. Instead, they slowly fade into the halfling soulmind, their memories and personalities becoming diffuse and indistinct, a part of the great ocean of halfling souls. 

In this way, the Divine Realm of the First Ones is less a place than a memory, a superposition of all the experiences, hopes, and dreams of halflings since the dawn of time.

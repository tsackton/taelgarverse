# The Five Siblings

The religion of the Dunmari is an old religion, adapted and evolved from the old ways when the Dunmari were a nomadic people living far to the south, before they settled among the ruins of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>). The Dunmari worship a [family pantheon](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/dunmari-pantheon.md>), the Five Siblings, along with other minor gods and goddesses. 

The Dunmari religion is synonymous with the Dunmari people, and the [beliefs](<./dunmari-beliefs.md>) and [worship traditions](<./dunmari-religious-practice.md>) of this religion are central to Dunmari culture. Pentagonal Dunmari temples, representing the five divine siblings, are among the most prominent physical structures in the Dunmari landscape, and the diverse [festivals](<../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/dunmari-festivals.md>) celebrating the divine are the foundation of the Dunmari calendar.

# Zariya



The *zariya* are the animal spirits worshipped by the [Vargaldi](<../../../groups/vargaldi.md>). The word, Zariya, refers both to deities, the small gods of the northern forests that take messages and prayers to the [Divine Presence](<../../gods/high-gods/divine-presence.md>), and to souls, the animal spirits of the [Vargaldi](<../../../groups/vargaldi.md>) people, that manifest when they shape-shift or summon animal companions. 

As a religion, the folk worship of the [Zariya](<./zariya.md>) bears many similarities to the other descendants of the early northern folk religions, [Tanshi Worship](<./tanshi-worship.md>) and the [Kestavo](<./kestavo.md>), with the notable distinction that the small gods are strongly tied to animal forms.

# Mos Numena

The practices and traditions associated with the worship of the Eight Divines are known, broadly, as Mos Numera, from the Drankorian for the Way of the Divine.

This tradition is a set of practices, rituals, and beliefs that have grown up around the worship of the Eight Divines, and broadly, follows several basic tenets:

* The gods have a personal relationship with all, and priests are not the only source of prayer and blessing
* Practices, places, and people who have been blessed in the past are more likely to be blessed in the future - and remembering the past blessings ensures this
* The gods speak to humans in signs, riddles, and omens -- rarely are they clear

Although there are eight named divines, they are best thought of archetypes - these are not deities with distinct personalities, feelings, and human emotions, but rather personifications are forces.

The Eight Divines are:

* [The Mother](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-mother.md>) (goddess of birth, fertility, spring, healing, wisdom, associated with the moon)
* [The Father](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-father.md>) (god of light, order, justice, summer, associated with the sun)
* [The Night Queen](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-night-queen.md>) (goddess of darkness, death, sleep, winter, associated with the night)
* [The Warlord](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-warlord.md>) (god of war, vengeance, smiths, autumn, associated with day)
* [The Sibyl](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-sibyl.md>) (goddess of magic, knowledge, love, beauty) 
* [The Wanderer](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-wanderer.md>) (god of travel, trade, strangers, and outcasts)
* [The Wyrdling](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-wyrdling.md>) (genderless deity of chaos, luck, and fate)
* [The Wildling](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-wildling.md>) (genderless deity of nature and elements)

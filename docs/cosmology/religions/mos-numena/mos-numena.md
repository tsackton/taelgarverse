# Mos Numena



The practices and traditions associated with the worship of the Eight Divines are known, broadly, as Mos Numera, from the Drankorian for the Way of the Divine, often referred to as simply The Way.

This tradition is a set of practices, rituals, and beliefs that have grown up around the worship of the Eight Divines, and broadly, follows several basic tenets:

* The gods have a personal relationship with all, and priests are not the only source of prayer and blessing
* Practices, places, and people who have been blessed in the past are more likely to be blessed in the future - and remembering the past blessings and miracles helps ensure future blessings and miracles
* The gods speak to humans in signs, riddles, and omens -- rarely are they clear
* Prayer, broadly speaking, is about asking the gods either for help, usually in the form of a miracle, or advice, in the form of omens and signs.

## The Eight Divines

In the Mos Numena tradition, there are [eight named divinities](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/mos-numena-pantheon.md>), that are generally seen as powerful  archetypes and the personification of forces and virtues, rather that individuals with distinct personalities, feelings, and human emotions. 

The Eight Divines are:

* [The Mother](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-mother.md>) (goddess of birth, fertility, spring, healing, wisdom, associated with the moon)
* [The Father](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-father.md>) (god of light, order, justice, summer, associated with the sun)
* [The Night Queen](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-night-queen.md>) (goddess of darkness, death, sleep, winter, associated with the night)
* [The Warlord](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-warlord.md>) (god of war, vengeance, smiths, autumn, associated with day)
* [The Sibyl](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-sibyl.md>) (goddess of magic, knowledge, love, beauty) 
* [The Wanderer](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wanderer.md>) (god of travel, trade, strangers, and outcasts)
* [The Wyrdling](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wyrdling.md>) (genderless deity of chaos, luck, and fate)
* [The Wildling](<../../gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wildling.md>) (genderless deity of nature and elements)

## History

Mos Numera is an old religion. Worship of the Eight Divines began on Hkar, and grew to become the dominant pantheonic tradition among the urban elite just before the Downfall. When the Hkarans fled, and founded Drankor, they brought the Way with them, and Mos Numera came into its own in the Drankorian Empire. The divine magic of the priests of Mos Numera was one of the pillars of defense of humanity, along with the arcane secrets of the magical energies of the Plane of Magic and other magical energy. 


  
As the Drankorian Empire spread, so did Mos Numera, first to the northeast, around the Green Sea and into Greater Sembara, and then later on the western side of the mountains. Even beyond the borders of the Empire itself, the power and glory of the Eight Divines attracted worshippers, and the cultural influence of the Way reached far. 
## Common Traditions

Although diverse regional variations on worship practices developed as Mos Numena spread across the lands of the former Drankorian Empire, some common traditions derived from Drankorian worship practices have persisted. 

The daily practices of worship associated with the Way are ancient, pre-dating Drankor even, and provide structure for the prayers to the Eight Divines. These include a personal component of worship, mediated through a household shrine or small personal altar, and a community component, mediated at a dedicated building (a temple). Prayers are varied, but usually involve asking for aid or advice, or offering praise or remembrance of past miracles, both large and small. 


In Drankor, prayers are offered to the Divine who can aid or assist in the subject at hand, and these Divines are believed to, when they grant miracles, act directly in the world. So, to ask for a safe journey one would pray to the Wanderer, and to ask for aid in childbirth one would pray to the Mother. 


  
In both personal and communal prayer, a tradition developed in Drankor that the gods can hear your prayers more clearly when you are speaking to them alone, when other gods cannot hear you. 


In temple practice, this tradition led to the development of a particularly Drankorian style of temple architecture: instead of one temple to the eight divines, which means none of them can hear your prayers, you have eight temples, each to one divine. In bigger settlements, this is usually in the form of a temple plaza, where each of the eight divines has a separate temple off the plaza. In smaller communities, you get clever architectural elaborations that give you eight separate/distinct spaces in one building. 


## The Priesthood

There are two distinct religious roles in the Mos Numera tradition: temple stewards, who are administrators that manage temples or temple complexes, and priests, who are blessed by the gods. 

Temple Stewards, in the Drankorian Empire, are civil servants, and appointed by the imperial hierarchy. They are not seen as particularly more religious than any other lay member of the community, nor are they expected to have an unusually close relationship with the gods. Small communities would usually just have one temple steward to manage the temple complex, while in larger communities there may be one for each temple of the Divine.

Priests, on the other hand, are explicitly blessed by the gods. The priesthood are seen as a set of people who have a direct and important relationship with the gods, or at least, understand the gods much better than others. Some can perform miracles themselves, and are highly valued and respected for that. Others, although they cannot perform miracles, are thought to understand the guidance of the gods and are sought out for the interpretation of signs and omens. Priests, in general, live independently of the temple structure but have there own very specific hierarchy. In Drankor, this hierarchy was usually associated with whatever magical orders they belonged to, but this has changed in different parts of the world as Mos Numera spread. 

While the details of how temple stewards and priests are organized and appointed varies among traditions, as does the hierarchy among temples or lack thereof, the fundamental distinction between lay administrators and divine priests persists across Mos Numera to the current day. 
## Greater Sembaran Tradition

In the current day, the Greater Sembaran tradition of the Way is one of (at least) three major strands of religious practice associated with the Eight Divines. This tradition is practiced in much of the western Green Sea, from Vostok through Sembara to Cymea and ~South Cymea~, and was the dominant religious tradition in ~Irebor~ before the Great War as well. 
### Overview

In order to fully understand the Sembaran religious tradition, it is also important to understand two key aspects of the ancient gods of the region, which have influenced the development of Mos Numera around the western Green Sea. 

First, in the ancient tradition, the gods (the Kestavo) were the intercedents, on behalf of humanity, with the great powers, [Ahra](<../../gods/high-gods/divine-presence.md>) and [Malik](<../../gods/high-gods/divine-presence.md>). Second, the Kestavo were local and closely tied to a community. No village would be founded without a sign from the Kestavo that one was willing to protect it and watch over it. Many of the Kestavo only had power in small areas -- a Kestavo might manifest as a sacred tree, or the god of a spring, or stream, but many were closely tied to a specific community. These small gods largely ceased to be worshipped as Mos Numera was spread by the Drankorians, but the idea that a close and personal relationship exists between a community and a divine being never left the culture.
### Traditions

The Sembaran tradition follows many of the shared traditional practices originating in Drankor and before, with a few key differences. The most important distinction is that, in the Sembaran tradition, the idea of a personal or communal relationship with a single Divine, who then carries your prayers to other gods, lingers from the ancient Kestavan religion. Thus, each community has a special connection to one of the eight divines, often in some way related to a community's founding, and the community keeps alive the memory of the times where their god has helped the community. The community usually sees this one divine as the main source of their prayer, and they ask 'their god' to intercede with the others. For example, a community whose god was the Mother would typically ask her to ensure the Wanderer's blessing before a journey, rather than actually praying directly to the Wanderer. Larger communities might have two or three gods, and the largest communities may have temples to recognize all eight of the divine, even though the specific community has its own dedication. For example, Embry maybe is seen as the child of the Mother and Father, and those are the key gods for Embry, but it embraces and has temples for the other six divines as well, out of respect and acknowledgement for the many places and people in Sembara dedicated to the other divines. 

This means that many of the associations developed in Drankor to keep the gods separate and able to hear prayers clearly, both the ritual association of particular gods to days of the week, and the temple architecture, have fallen by the wayside in Sembara, since only one god needs to hear your prayers to bring them to all the others. 

Even when a community is dedicated to a specific god, subsets of the community, down even to the household, may be connected to other gods. So in a small town like Clenseau, the town may be dedicated to the Wanderer, but the military garrison may be dedicated to the Warlord and several specific households may have personal relationships with the Mother. There is a strong tradition having a single Divine as the prime god of a group, and usually people in a town are raised to that god, but it isn't an exclusive relationship and it isn't weird to go against it. For example, a specific soldier from Embry might personally see the Father as his primary god, but he then lives in a military garrison that is focused on the Night Queen, which is in a town dedicated to the Wanderer. This wouldn't mean he is torn between three loyalties or anything, it would just mean that if he was praying for success in battle for his unit, he'd pray to the Night Queen to intercede on his unit's behalf. If he was praying for personal valor in arms, he'd pray to the Father to incede with the Warlord on his behalf. And if he was praying for good crops this year or the health of the lord's son, he would pray for the Wanderer to intercede with the Mother on his towns behalf. 

To follow through on that same example soldier, he'd have a small personal shrine or sacred object, which would be the focus of his personal prayers, and then there would be a small shrine in the barracks to the Night Queen, and a larger temple in the town to the Wanderer. But if the innkeepers guid or whatever had a particular affinity for the Wilding, they might maintain a small separate temple to the Wildling in town. And those folks who migrated here from an upriver hamlet whose community god was the Wildling might also pray at that small temple. 

But importantly, it wouldn't be seen as whoever needs the help or intercession or wisdom of the Wildling would pray at the Wildling's temple. It would be more of a personal relationship, and the folks who had a relationship would pray at the Wildling's temple to intercede with whoever's help they needed.

In addition to daily prayer, the temples would be the focal point for feast days, which would largely be festivals of remembrance (think Hanukkah / Passover) of various miracles, and might vary wildly between towns and regions. Miracles are relatively common, and so even a small village might have had one or two in its history. As in other Mos Numera traditions, temple stewards without a particular religious role administer the temples, and the divinely blessed priesthood is independent. In Sembara, the temple stewards are appointed by the community (which in some cases means the lord or the king, in others they might be elected or selected by the previous temple leader) to ensure that the temple is kept up, and most importantly, that miracles are remembered. One of the key duties is keeping lists of miracles that have happened nearby, or finding tales of miracles from travelers or elsewhere. Recalling the story how someone's kid miraculously recovered from a disease is seen to help bring that same intercession down on you. So literacy is important for these temple stewards. Another key duty is organizing the feast days and celebrations and keeping up the temple itself. It is seen as important to respect the gods and of course the places where they are worshipped shouldn't be a place the gods would be ashamed to look at, or they might not listen to those people speaking there. 

Sacrifice is not very important in the scheme of things as in general the gods are seen to value stories, dances, songs, and other human activities more than physical goods (it is largely assumed if the gods wanted meat, they would simply create it). However, there is a tradition of small sacrifices as a way to check for a god's favour. Pouring out a bit of wine, or leaving a small coin or valuable gem at the altar very rarely results in the wine, gem, or coin actually physically disappearing. This is seen as a minor miracle itself and a very important sign that the god heard and will act on your prayer. So for those with a lot of wealth, it is seen as a display of power and wealth to leave a large sacrifice, especially for important prayers. And of course if the gods do not take the sacrifice, it is not taken back, that would be seen as a significant insult to the gods. The untaken sacrifices go to the temple and are an important source of revenue especially for larger city temples.

Each temple is largely independent and a reflection of its own community and there is little sense that the temple of the Mother in Embry is in any way 'superior' to a small shrine to the Mother in a hamlet in the western marches. One doesn't report to the other, and no wealth flows between them. The temples are reflections of the communities they are in, and if the temple in Embry is burnished with gold and the shrine in the hamlet has no roof, that is because the different communities have different resources. The traditions in Sembara hold that the relative wealth of different temples is not a reflection of holiness or worth; the gods do not care as long as you are not trying to cheat them. So a rich community with a shabby temple would be taking a risk, but a poor community that can only support a shabby temple would not. It would usually be seen as odd for someone outside a community to dedicate money to that community's temple, and in general temples are seen as a community's 'Sunday best' -- you want to put your best foot forward with the gods, but not at the expense of having food on the table.
### Priesthood

The administrators of the temples are not really priests, and are not seen as particularly more religious than others or with a closer relationship to the gods. They are called stewards or temple stewards, and are seen as basically working for the community. There is however, a small priesthood, largely unconnected from the temples themselves. These are people who are blessed by the gods, and are divided up into three classes: the Elders, the Disciples, and the Acolytes. The priesthood are seen as a set of people who have a direct and important relationship with the gods, or at least, understand the gods much better than others. Some can perform miracles themselves, and are highly valued and respected for that. Others, although they cannot perform miracles, are thought to understand the guidance of the gods and are sought out for the interpretation of signs and omens. Priests, in general, live independently of the temple structure but have there own very specific hierarchy.

At the top are the Elders, of which there are about a hundred or a hundred and fifty in the region. The Elders almost exclusively have a true divine connection, and can perform magic, although it is not strictly a requirement. Becoming an Elder requires the agreement of the gods, as mediated through the current Elders. The rare Elder who cannot perform miracles is usually unnaturally blessed at understanding omens and signs. Each Elder largely settles down, although several could be clustered in one large city, and a place like Tollen might have 10 or 15. Each Elder is usually dedicated to one of the eight divines, but very rarely an Elder has multiple divine patrons, or even the entire pantheon. Elders are sought out for their miracles and advice, and are often asked to pray alongside a petionary, which is thought to bring a god's attention more clearly to the prayer. In exchange for miracles and prayers and advice, gifts are given to the elders (in some cases, extremely handsome gifts for great miracles). There is no particular larger organization, and each Elder is largely on their own for what to do with this wealth. Some live lavish lives, others give it away to the poor, and others use it to build organizations and followers. Some Elders may live at a temple, where they are of course always welcome, but very rarely if ever would the temple steward actually be a priest.

Beneath the elders are the Disciples. Often, these are students of a specific Elder, although not always, and many disciples do not find new 'masters' when the elder they learned from dies (although some do). These people are thought to have deep understanding of signs and omens, and the ear of the gods (so to speak) but many cannot perform miracles themselves (some can). There are about a thousand or fifteen hundred scattered through the region, and they are usually the most important priest someone will encounter. When the lord's son is marrying, it is the disciple who will ask the gods for blessing and guidance on behalf of the lord, and they are often part of significant rites (mostly births and marriages and other new starts, rather than endings such as deaths, which are more a time for remembrance within the community than miracles and omens). Some disciples live near the elders they serve, and in some places there are significant communities of priests. Others live on their own or in small towns and villages across the countryside. But not every town has a disciple, and having one is not always a sign of the size of a town. A disciple may settle in a small hamlet, bypassing the nearby market town. Like Elders, disciples are paid for their services, although rarely enough for the disciple to do much more than live on it at a similar standard to the wealthy in their community (a disciple in a small hamlet will get the choicest meat and fresh bread, and live similarly to a rich peasant. A disciple in Embry likely lives as well as a baron, if they wish). Some use the wealth to support acolytes they have trained. 

Beneath the disciples are the acolytes. These are the 'lay priests'. Rarely do they have divine magic (although the few that do often end up elders), but nonetheless they have always studied with an elder or a disciple, and are certainly thought to have better insights into the will of the gods than common folk. Basically a smaller scale version of a disciple, commanding less respect and less likely to have magic, but a similar role in society. There are four or five thousand acolytes in the region, enough that many towns and villages have one, but it is not uncommon for them not to. Some acolytes ride circuits to help those in wider areas, others are settled in a particular town or village, and others come together under a disciple or an elder as part of a larger organization. All have trained, at least some, under an elder or disciple, and usually they really do have a better sense of the signs and omens than others. 

All communities have temples and temple stewards, not all communities have priests. But most communities have at least a part time priest, even if it is just an acolyte who studied for a year under a disciple and now rides a circuit of ten villages every month in summer.
### Religious Orders

Sembaran culture has a long history of being hostile to organized, structured magical practice, especially orders of associated with the scholarly study of magic. This means that Sembara does not have a homegrown tradition of religious orders. However, that does not mean that no organized groups of priests ever exist in Sembara. Occasionally, an Elder or small group of Elders inspire a certain kind of following, and this may turn into a semblance of a religious order. But these rarely have a larger life beyond the founder, and they typically fade away when the founder dies.

Although potentially over the years, for various historically specific reasons, some elders founded orders that outlived them. Nothing says a religious order has to have a hierarchy with a elder at the head. And maybe after a few cycles of elders replacing each other as the head of the order, it is customary to select one rather than wait to see if one wants to join. This could even be divinely inspired, i.e. it could just happen that whenever the current head of the healers of the night queen (or whatever) dies, some other elder or disciple always happens to get a dream from the night queen telling them to go be the head of the order. And who says no to a command from your god?

The first human migrations from Hkar brought with them an early intercessory religion, a belief that the spirits of the land would carry prayers and curses to Ahra, Malik, and the early primordial gods of Celestia, Arborea, the Nine Hells, and the Abyss.

The descendants of these settlers worship the tanshi, the numerous small gods of the lands.

# Zariya

The *zariya* are the animal spirits worshipped by the [Vargaldi](<../../groups/vargaldi.md>). The word, Zariya, refers both to deities, the small gods of the northern forests that take messages and prayers to the [High Gods](<../gods/high-gods/high-gods.md>), and to souls, the animal spirits of the [Vargaldi](<../../groups/vargaldi.md>) people, that manifest when they shape-shift or summon animal companions. 

As a religion, the folk worship of the [Zariya](<./zariya.md>) bears many similarities to the other descendants of the early northern folk religions, the [Tanshi](<./tanshi.md>) and the [Kestavo](<kestavo/kestavo.md>), with the notable distinction that the small gods are strongly tied to animal forms.

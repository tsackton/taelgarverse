#### The First Ones

The halfling people worship three gods, known collectively as the First Ones or the First Ancestors: Nwana, the Stranger and Child; Obito, the Music Maker and Merchant; and Jemghari, the Storyteller and Traveler. 

The First Ones are often thought of as two-faced gods, each reflecting two aspects of life that are both different and related, one looking inward, the other looking outward. They are also the keepers of the collective mind and soul of the race, the ultimate guardians of the joined spirit of all halflings stretching back to the beginning.

Nwana, the Stranger/Child, reflects the home, hearth, and family, reflecting the duality of the inward-looking child and the outward-looking stranger. Nwana is often thought to watch over both the family you have, and the family you don’t yet know, the idea that for halflings, outsider-ness and insider-ness, strangers and kin, are not separate from each other, but reflect the memories of your body (your family, kin, community) and the memories of your soul (strangers, in halfling communities, being simply people you have not remembered meeting yet). Here, the concept of the other, or strangers, explicitly reflects the nature of other halflings; a separate concept reflects strangers who are not part of the soul/mind community of halflings.  

Obito, the Music Maker/Merchant, reflects joy, community, friendship, creativity, creation, commerce, and trade, again reflected against a backdrop of otherness (Merchant) vs insiderness (Music Maker). Jemghari, the Storyteller/Wanderer, reflects the journey and the halfling concept of stories, which are central to their culture, reflecting the halfling idea that there are only two kinds of tales in the world: you go on a journey, or a stranger comes to town, which are really the same story. Jemghari, therefore, is the one who can experience this story from both perspectives at once.

# Thark

Thark, the God of War Without End, created by the union of [Umidzka](<../high-gods/umidzka.md>) and [Gâ€™Zab](<../high-gods/gzab.md>), gave rise to the [Orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), and through his compulsion drives them to violence for the sake of violence. 

Some [Orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), including the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>), the [Orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) who now live in [Xurkhaz](<../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), have found a way to break Thark's hold and live free.

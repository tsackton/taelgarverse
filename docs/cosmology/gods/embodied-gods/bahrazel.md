# The Bahrazel

The embodied gods of the [Dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) and the mystical firstborn of their race. Legend says the seven Bahrâzel were created from living rock, given form and magic and empowered to create the dwarven people in their image.

The connection dwarves have with the Bahrâzel also allows them to inscribe runes with magical effects. While in most cases these are small, such as mending a broken item, some legendary dwarves can create extraordinary magical items, wards, and marks of power. Dwarves’ connection to the Bahrâzel is also expressed through their belief that they are a living part of the mountains: they are a crucial part of the life cycle of mountains and mountains form the focus of their spiritual existence.

The Bahrâzel, the seven gods of the dwarves, play a significant role in dwarven society. They are worshipped as the creators of the dwarven race, and many dwarves will call upon the Bahrâzel in times of stress and danger, with a quick prayer for intercession; they are the patrons and protectors of the race. While they have individual identities, many dwarves worship the Bahrâzel as a whole, thinking of the seven gods as aspects of one divinity. The reality of the Bahrâzel is much debated in dwarven theological circles.

### The Seven Dwarven Gods

- Uzdan (he/him), the Ruler, the patron of those who lead, whether armies or kingdoms, and worshipped as the first king of the dwarves
- Karthel (he/him), the Runecrafter, the patron of scholars and rune-mages and seekers of lost lore, worshipped as the originator of runic magic
- Fanrukel (she/her), the Priest, the patron of storytellers and those who keep the histories of clans and kingdoms, worshipped as the first lorekeeper of the dwarves
- Tarbaka (she/her), the Stoneworker, the patron of artisans and the forge, worshipped as the first crafter of the dwarves
- Azar (he/him), the Warrior, the patron of those who fight to defend the dwarven kingdoms, worshipped as the strongest warrior and original defender of the dwarven race
- Maganna (she/her), the Traveler, the patron of those who wander, whether seeking new tunnels and ore deep underground or venturing into the wider outside world, worshipped as the first miner of the dwarves
- Oshkir (he/him), the Farmer, the patron of living things, growth, healing, and teaching, worshipped as the first teacher of the dwarves

### Notes on Dwarven Religion

The main idea and guiding principle of Dwarven religion is based around set of obligations and debts in exchange for power and favors. This is kind of feudal in nature, with the Bahrazel ultimately the “monarch” and everyone else tied into a web of obligations, responsibilities, rights, and privileges. 

The most fundamental of these obligations is the blessing of the naming rite, becoming part of the dwarven community and accepting the obligations of the Bahrazel, and in return gaining the connection that sustains dwarven racial magic. Dwarves who never complete the ritual are seen as variously traitors and deserters, or, more benignly, non-citizens or even non-dwarves. And abandoning your clan, thuhr, and obligations to the Bahrazel after the ritual is a much greater crime than simply never making the exchange in the first place. 

The obligations that flow from this exchange are largely be around accepting one’s role in dwarven society, and accepting a kind of communal / socialist ethos, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”, but restricted, of course, to dwarves alone – the supposed reputation for greed of dwarves is largely imposed outsiders who don't understand the culture. 

Many dwarves are not particularly religious, in that there isn’t a lot of prayer or holy days. Certainly there are holidays venerating the Bahrazel, but in many parts of dwarven society these would have a bit of a “secular” gloss, kind of like nationalist/patriotic holidays – a bit of a “founding fathers” vibe. 

Also, the Bahrazel don’t really grant prayers in the usual sense, and that typically divine power is accompanied by divine obligation. Unlike many human religions where the gods / divine gain strength through prayer and thus use miracles to sustain faith, the Bahrazel are just the Bahrazel, they don’t get stronger or weaker based on the strength of dwarven belief. Indeed, the debt or obligation to the Bahrazel is almost a physical thing, a fragment of dwarven essence, that is passed into [Heart of the Mountain](<../../multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>) to allow the Bahrazel to reach into the world, and that that trade is in fact necessary for them to operate. Hence the need to travel to [Heart of the Mountain](<../../multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>) to obtain your name and thuhr and runic power - each dwarf must leave a bit of themselves behind in the divine realm, an obligation to the Bahrazel, and it is that left-behind bit that powers their runic magic. Metaphysically, the idea is that the embodied gods have more physicality than the incorporeal gods. 

Theologically, there is a lot of debate in dwarven society about the nature of the Bahrazel, are they independent gods, facets of one god, or something else. Many dwarves simply worship them as a collective, for example, giving little thought to the individualistic nature of the seven. 

### Dwarven Religious Practice

Dwarves don't have a particularly ritual or prayer oriented religion, or even really a religion in the human sense. The Baharzel are like the mountains. You depend on them, they are the foundation of your society and wealth, but you don’t and in some sense can’t have any kind of personal relationship with them. 

That said — dwarves have prayed for, and been granted, miracles of divine intervention, but as a consequence incur a debt to the gods. Because of this, prayers are almost seen as kind of dangerous. The Baharzel might grant your prayer, but if they do they have power over you. And they can yank you out of your life to serve their purposes. So prayer is what you do when you are truly desperate. 

Even those who wield divine magic don't necessarily have a strong pray-based relationship with the Baharzel. Instead, they have a relationship that is more of a knight/lord kind of relationship, almost feudal with a sense of reciprocal obligations.  

The Baharzel are literally the source of runic magic, which most dwarves can use to some degree. So they are ever-present, but impersonal in a way. Many dwarves see the Baharzel as the kind of glue that holds everything together, that in some sense enforce the debts of honor and obligation that hold dwarven society together. But you don’t really worship glue. 

Dwarven religious practice, such as it exists, is thus much more of celebration of dwarven history, of dwarven heroes. Unlike say [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), most dwarven holidays are not the feast days for gods but commemoration of heroes from the past, and especially memorials to those fallen. There are a number of celebrations and days of remembrance and the like around the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), and even going back to the first wars of [The Downfall](<../../../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>). 

That said, ceremonies around birth, the transition to adulthood, and death are explicitly religious. In particular, the ceremony of name-taking is deeply personal, basically a solo quest to find [Heart of the Mountain](<../../multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>), which is the plane of the Baharzel. And in death, the hope of any dwarf for their spirit to return with honor to that place and dwell with the firstborn. But I am not sure there is much of a religious rite here — dwarven culture feels to me very strongly in the works over faith camp, and if by the time you die you are doomed to either destruction of your soul entirely or some kind of purgatory, it is too late, no last minute prayer is going to help you. And if the firstborn can lead living dwarves to their domain, of course they can gather spirits. So again I think burial customs would largely be around a celebration and honoring of the person, without a lot of explicitly religious rituals.

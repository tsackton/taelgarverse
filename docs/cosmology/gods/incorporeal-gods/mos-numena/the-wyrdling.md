### The Wyrdling
*they/them*

One of the [Eight Divines](<../../../religions/mos-numena.md>) of the [Mos Numena](<../../../religions/mos-numena.md>), the religious tradition that spread from [Drankor](<../../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) into much of the western world of Taelgar. 

The Wyrdling is rarely depicted in human form, and is depicted in many ways. The most common are chaotic and natural in nature: an embodied storm, a whirlpool, sometimes a rainbow. But some depictions show the Wyrdling as a jester with two faces, one male and one female, happy and sad at the same time. Othertimes they are depicted as a androgynous face, often depicted as if it was mid-shift from male to female. They are the Divine of chaos, luck, chance, and fate, and are associated with prophecy, divination, dreams, and the virtue of hope. They watch over those taking risks or chances, as well as artists and poets, and those who are lost in their own minds.

They are also the divine of transgender people, and anyone born 'out of season' with themselves.

# The Sibyl
*she/her*

One of the [Eight Divines](<../../../religions/mos-numena.md>) of the [Mos Numena](<../../../religions/mos-numena.md>), the religious tradition that spread from [Drankor](<../../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) into much of the western world of Taelgar. 

The Sibyl is usually depicted as a young, beautiful woman, with striking features, carrying a wand, often associated with some elemental power. Sometimes she is depicted with a book instead of a wand. She is the Goddess of magic, song, knowledge, love, and beauty, associated with deep study and also obsession, with the passage of time and the cycles of the moon, and the virtue of love. She watches over marriage, and scholars, and acts of magic.

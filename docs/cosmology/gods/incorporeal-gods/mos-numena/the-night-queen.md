# The Night Queen
*she/her*

One of the [Eight Divines](<../../../religions/mos-numena.md>) of the [Mos Numena](<../../../religions/mos-numena.md>), the religious tradition that spread from [Drankor](<../../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) into much of the western world of Taelgar. 

The Night Queen is usually depicted as a pale woman, often of indeterminate age, often old. She is usually depicted wearing black robes, and with her face cloaked in shadow, often leaning on a cane. She is the Goddess of darkness, death, and sleep, especially associated with the transition from life to death, and the much rarer transition back to life again. She is the defender against undead and the unnatural extension of life, and associated with the night, and winter, and the virtue of compassion. She watches over funerals, and keeps the night safe.

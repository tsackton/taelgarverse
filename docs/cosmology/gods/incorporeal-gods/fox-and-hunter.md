# The Fox and Hunter

A demigod and constellation in the night sky of a hunter with a fox companion. This constellation appeared in the sky after the events of the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), and is thought to be the divine spirit of the hero [Beryl](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/beryl.md>) and his [fox companion](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/companions/willow-wind.md>) who fought by his side with his allies against [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>).

### Sonkar

The goddess of beauty, artisans, truth, and justice. She is the dispassionate one, the one who weighs the deeds of souls coming to the realm of [the Five Siblings](<../../../religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>). She is also the protector of artisans, smiths, and other craftspeople, and is seen as the one who watches over commerce and trade, punishing cheaters and ensuring fairness. She is the guardian of judgment in life as well, and watches over trials and the law.

She is the patron deity of the Dunmari [Day of Atonement](<../../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/day-of-atonement.md>).

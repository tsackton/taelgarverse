# Jeevali

The goddess of life, rebirth, home, and family. Often seen as the eldest and most important of [the Five Siblings](<../../../religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>), a first among equals. The peacemaker between the sometimes fractious relationships among the four other siblings. In the west, seen as the patron god of [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) for her role in making the land what it was before the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). Generally looked to in times of trouble. Seen as the mother of [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), as the protector of the people, as the one who chose the Dunmari for their great purpose. She especially watches over births, the home and family, and the harvest, and is the one who is seen as ensuring the monsoon rains come when they should.

Jeevali is intimately tied with [The Founding of Dunmar](<../../../../primary-sources/the-founding-of-dunmar.md>), and her feast day, the [Festival of Rebirth](<../../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/festival-of-rebirth.md>), celebrates also the events of [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)'s founding.

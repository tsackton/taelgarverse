### Laka

The god of knowledge, history, time, memories, of the seasons, of the ancestors, and the passage of the year. Often seen as the keeper of traditions, as the one who determines the right moment for things, of the god of beginnings and endings. He is seen as the “cool head” among the Divine Siblings, the one counseling for caution and certainly and less risky courses of action. He is often seen as the second most important of the Divines, after [Jeevali](<./jeevali.md>), and the one who is the keeper of [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)’s “soul”. He especially watches over funerals, and the memory of ancestors, and is the protector of the ruler of [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) and the government. The one who understands the reason for things.

He is associated with the color blue. 

His mystery cult, the Lakan Mystai, is associated with knowledge and magic, studying both the power of Arcane magic from the [Plane of Magic](<../../../multiverse/energy-realms/plane-of-magic.md>) and the spiritual energy of the [Plane of Souls](<../../../multiverse/spiritual-realms/plane-of-souls.md>).

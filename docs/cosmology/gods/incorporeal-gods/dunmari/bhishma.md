# Bhishma
:speaker:{ .middle } *(BHEESH-ma)*  

The mortal founder of [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), the first Samraat (ruler) and the revered mother of the country, now raised to godhood as a demigod. Her order sees to the souls of the Dunmari and preserves the stories of the people of Dunmari. 

Had two children with [Laka](<./laka.md>): [Shakun](<./shakun.md>), who became divine, and [Kotana](<../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/kotana.md>), who followed her as ruler of the Dunmari and ushered in the first Dunmari golden age of peace and prosperity. 

Her feast day is the [Feast of Bhishma](<../../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/feast-of-bhishma.md>).

Her mystery cult, the [Order of the Awakened Soul](<../../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/order-of-the-awakened-soul.md>), is largely destroyed, but the remnants that still exist remain focused on telling and preserving the stories of the people of [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), and ensuring that souls of the dead make it safely to the spirit realms.

# Kaikkea

The ocean goddess of the Skaer people. Kaikkea is the source of all, the mother ocean, the giver of life but also the bringer of storms. She is worshipped as the embodiment of the ocean. 

She is an ancient god, and her worship dates to before [The Downfall](<../../../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>): the mariner people that left Hkar and originally settled the [Green Sea](<../../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) several thousand years ago brought worship of Kaikkea to the mainland.

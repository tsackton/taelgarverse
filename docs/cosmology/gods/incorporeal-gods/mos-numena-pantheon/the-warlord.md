# The Warlord


A deity in the [Mos Numena](<../../../religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) pantheon, and one of the [Incorporeal Gods](<../incorporeal-gods.md>) of humanity. 

The Warlord is usually depicted as a man in his prime, armed and armored (the exact weapons vary among cultures), often mounted on a horse, usually strong. However, he is occasionally also depicted as a smith, working in his forge. He is the God of war, vengeance, smiths, iron, and the forge. He is associated with the heat of the day, and autumn, and the virtue of courage. He watches over battle and war, as well as crafters and especially smiths and metalworkers.

# The Eight Divines

The followers of [Mos Numena](<../../../religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) worship eight divines. These deities are archetypes: they are not usually thought of as beings with distinct personalities, feelings, or human emotion, but rather as personification of forces and virtues. 

The Eight Divines are:

* [The Mother](<./the-mother.md>) (goddess of birth, fertility, spring, healing, wisdom, associated with the moon)
* [The Father](<./the-father.md>) (god of light, order, justice, summer, associated with the sun)
* [The Night Queen](<./the-night-queen.md>) (goddess of darkness, death, sleep, winter, associated with the night)
* [The Warlord](<./the-warlord.md>) (god of war, vengeance, smiths, autumn, associated with day)
* [The Sibyl](<./the-sibyl.md>) (goddess of magic, knowledge, love, beauty) 
* [The Wanderer](<./the-wanderer.md>) (god of travel, trade, strangers, and outcasts)
* [The Wyrdling](<./the-wyrdling.md>) (nonbinary deity of chaos, luck, and fate)
* [The Wildling](<./the-wildling.md>) (nonbinary deity of nature and elements)

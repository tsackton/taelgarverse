# The Sibyl



A deity in the [Mos Numena](<../../../religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) pantheon, and one of the [Incorporeal Gods](<../incorporeal-gods.md>) of humanity. 

The Sibyl is usually depicted as a young, beautiful woman, with striking features, carrying a wand, often associated with some elemental power. Sometimes she is depicted with a book instead of a wand. She is the Goddess of magic, song, knowledge, love, and beauty, associated with deep study and also obsession, with the passage of time and the cycles of the moon, and the virtue of love. She watches over marriage, and scholars, and acts of magic.

The Sibyl's wand is typically depicted as a simple wand, with a sleek shaft that twists into a spirally, corkscrew-like design, subtly hinting at the shape of a heart at the point, perhaps. This is sometimes used as a holy symbol, especially by her clerics.

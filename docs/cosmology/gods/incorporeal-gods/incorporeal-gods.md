# Incorporeal Gods



The Incorporeal Gods are the deities of belief, the many divinities that came into being through the power of the divine spark of humanity. These gods are sustained by the power of their human worshippers. While they can be very powerful, and have the strength to act in the world itself, their power in the material world waxes and wanes with the strength of their worshippers’ belief. 




## Demigods



The divine spark that gives the incorporeal gods life and power is a living thing, and the incorporeal gods can, in times of need, gift some of this power to another, imbuing a powerful creature with some measure of divinity. Although doing so diminishes the giving god, as they give away some of their power, if in turn such an act inspires more belief, they heal and grow stronger through the growing strength of their worshippers. And the receiving creature gains some measure of strength, and becomes a demigod. 

Some demigods attract belief, and grow in power, and become the focus of worship themselves, raising themselves to full godhood. Some even overthrow their divine creators, and become in the eyes of their followers the true divinity. Others, however, never attract divine belief, and so never grow beyond the strength originally imbued in them by their creators. 

A number of demigods dot the landscape of Taelgar. Some, like [Shakun](<dunmari-pantheon/shakun.md>) and [Bhishma](<dunmari-pantheon/bhishma.md>) of the Dunmari pantheon, are minor gods in the story of larger religions. Others, like the [Fox and Hunter](<./fox-and-hunter.md>), are heroes gifted the status of the divine in rewards for their great deeds. Still others have origins that remain shrouded in mystery, such as Vorshitaal, the god of the kenku.

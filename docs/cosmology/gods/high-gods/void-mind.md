# The Void Mind

The Void Mind, alien and not understood, without power, without any ability to reach the material world, is also a high god of a kind, also distant and uncaring of prayer and belief, but dedicated to emptiness, to undoing the creation of the multiverse and all of the work and creation of the [Divine Presence](<./divine-presence.md>). Whether cults of worship to the Void exist is not recorded in lore.Â

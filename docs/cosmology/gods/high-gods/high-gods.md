# High Gods

The most powerful and most distant divinities are known as the High Gods, or sometimes the Creator Gods. For most folk of Taelgar, the Creator is synonymous with the [Divine Presence](<./divine-presence.md>). However, some speak of darker powers: the [Three Despairs](<./three-despairs.md>), the fragments of the [Void Mind](<./void-mind.md>), who seek to end all existence. These powers, too, are High Gods. 

The story of High Gods is told in the myths of Mos Numena:

*In the beginning, there was the Void, an endless space that was at once nothing and everything. Into this Void the Divine Beings came into existence. Known as Arha and Malik, representing life and death, creation and destruction.*  

*As Arha and Malik tore through the fabric of the Void, and shaped its energy into the creation of the material plane and the world of Taelgar, something in the Void awoke that did not want a world to be, sometimes called the Void Mind or the Undivine. This utterly alien mind, if that was the right word for it, could not create, even the smallest pebble, for the act of Creation itself was antithetical to its very existence, but it sought to erase all of Arha and Malik’s work.*

*Although it could not create, the Void Mind could steal, misdirect, reshape. It waited, and watched, patiently. Until, as Arha and Malik shaped the embodied gods and bestowed them with Divine power, the Void Mind stole the breath of the Divine Presence, and out of itself spun the Three Despairs: Umidzka, the Empty; G’Zab, the All Consuming; and Jinnik, the Madness, and through these beings this mind worked in the shadows against the creations of the Divine. Some have even speculated that the Three Despairs unleashed embodied curses into the world, attributing the curse of undeath and necromancy to Umidzka, and the curse of lycanthropy to Jinnik.*

# Ako

In the [Kestavo](<../../religions/kestavo.md>) tradition, one creator god is acknowledged, called Ako. The small gods, the [Kestavo](<../../religions/kestavo.md>), carry the prayers of their communities to Ako, who grants blessings. It is from Ako that the power of the [kestavo](<../../religions/kestavo.md>) flow to their worshippers.

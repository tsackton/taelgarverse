# Tanshi

The tanshi are the small gods worshiped by the Deno'qai and other followers of the [Tanshi Worship](<../../religions/northern-folk-religions/tanshi-worship.md>) tradition. 

While there are many, many tanshi, perhaps hundreds, most villages and tribes favor a smaller number, and few individuals regularly offer sacrifices and prayers to more than a dozen or so of the tanshi. 

Each individual tanshi is weak, unable to grant miracles on their own: they instead carry prayers to the [Divine Presence](<../high-gods/divine-presence.md>), known as Anida among the Deno'qai, and serve as a conduit for miracles.

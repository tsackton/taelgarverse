### Yezali

The spirit of the hunt, the moon, and the night. Particularly attracted by offerings from a fresh hunt. 

Trapped in a shadow demi-plane after the defeat of [Cha'mutte](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) in the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), and thought dead by the Deno'qai, considered one of the [Meswati](<./meswati.md>), the lost tanshi. 


Survived, however, in the demi-plane, and became associated with [Delwath](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), calling themselves Aaviskar. Freed finally by [Delwath](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) in his [adventures](<../../../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-53-dufr.md>) in the [Forest of Nightmares](<../../../../gazetteer/far-north/forest-of-nightmares.md>).

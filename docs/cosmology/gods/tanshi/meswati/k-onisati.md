# K'onisati
:speaker:{ .middle } *(koh-nee-SAH-tee)*  

The tanshi of butterflies and other colorful insects. Loves the birth of new beauty, especially the transformation of a caterpillar to a butterfly. Particularly fond of the sacrifice of cocoons and other remains of the butterfly's transformation -- is said to look askew at those who sacrifice beauty though, and definitely does not like those who catch butterflies, for example.

One of the [Meswati](<./meswati.md>), the lost tanshi, trapped during the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and silent since.

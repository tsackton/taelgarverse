# Aasimti
:speaker:{ .middle } *(ah-SEEM-tee)*  



The spirit of forest leaves and dappled shadows. This tanshi has a long association with the [Elderwood](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>) in particular, where they are strongest and most prominent. 


In DR 1721, [Jordo](<../../../people/deno-qai/jordo.md>), the Godcaller of the Te'kula, united a fragment of [Rai's hand](<../../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>) with an ancient tree, a locus of Aasimit's power in the [Elderwood](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>). The spirit of [Rai](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>) and Aasimti became entangled, with Rai providing a focus on the material plane to amplify and challenge Aasimti's power. 

In DR 1722, when [Grimbaskal](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>) attacked the Te'kula seeking the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>), Aasimti, challenging divine and arcane power through Rai, was able to shift the [Te'kula village](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/te-kula-village.md>) to a demiplane, protecting it from [Grimbaskal](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>). 

In DR 1748, the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) killed [Grimbaskal](<../../../people/other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>), and were gifted the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>), disentangling Aasimti from [Rai](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>) and returning the [Te'kula village](<../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/te-kula-village.md>) to the material plane.

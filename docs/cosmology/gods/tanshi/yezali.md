### Yezali

The spirit of the hunt, the moon, and the night. Particularly attracted by offerings from a fresh hunt. 

Trapped in a shadow demi-plane after the defeat of [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) in the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), and thought dead by the Deno'qai, considered one of the Meswati, the lost tanshi. 

Survived, however, in the demi-plane, and became associated with [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), calling themselves Aaviskar. Freed finally by [Delwath](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) in his [adventures](<../../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-51-52-dufr.md>) in the [Forest of Nightmares](<../../../gazetteer/far-north/forest-of-nightmares.md>).

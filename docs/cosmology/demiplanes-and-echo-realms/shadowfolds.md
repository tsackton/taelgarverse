# Shadowfolds
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A plane the [Echo Realms](<./echo-realms.md>)  
</div>


The Shadowfolds are the name, popularized by the Drankorian text On Metaphysics, for the collection of demiplanes associated particularly with the resonances of great evil. In the Standard Multiversal Model, these are considered [Echo Realms](<./echo-realms.md>): the few reliable reports of planar travelers who explored and lived to escape these dark domains suggest that, like the [Feywild](<../feywild.md>), there is a rough physical correspondence between the features of the Shadowfolds and the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>). 

Unlike Fey Realms, the domains of the Shadowfolds cannot be so easily traversed, and travel between them is difficult, if not impossible. Indeed, each Shadowfold domain is perhaps better considered to be its own demiplane, as Camilla of Drankor proposed, colored and shaped by the particular evils of whatever dread lord made it. Emyr of Tafolwern even went so far as to propose that the Shadowfolds are really prisons for those who commit vast sins, and the existence of each Shadowfold domain is tied to the punishment of a particular evil soul, trapped there forever. 

*(While there is more to say about the Shadowfolds, and significant lore likely exists, it largely has not been invented yet! - Eds.)

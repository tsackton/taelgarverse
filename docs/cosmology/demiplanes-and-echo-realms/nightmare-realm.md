# The Nightmare Realm

-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A rumored plane in the [Echo Realms](<./echo-realms.md>)  
</div>


Many rumors exist about the hypothesized Nightmare Realm. On Metaphysics hypothesizes the existence of a corrupted counterpart to the [Dreamworld](<../dreamworld.md>), much as the domains of the [Shadowfolds](<./shadowfolds.md>) are described as a corrupted counterpart to the [Feywild](<../feywild.md>). Camilla of Drankor wrote of the dark extraplanar horrors that even the fey refused to name, presuming they must come from some nightmare place. More recently, Nicole Ardouin argued that the legends of the Nightmare Realm are likely just variants of the legends of the [Far Realms](<../far-realms.md>), but her work has always been considered marginal by the authorities of the Faculty of Metaphysics.

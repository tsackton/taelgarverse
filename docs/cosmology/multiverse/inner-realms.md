# Inner Realms

The Inner Realms are the name for the collection of planes that are contained within the bounds of the [River of Souls](<spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>). These include the [Material Plane](<./material-plane.md>), as well as the [Energy Realms](<energy-realms/energy-realms.md>) and the [Plane of Souls](<./plane-of-souls.md>).

The Inner Realms were, generally speaking, created during the [Riving](<../../events/ancient/riving.md>) and are associated with the living. Dead souls cannot naturally sustain themselves on the Inner Realms side of the [Land of the Dead](<spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>). The Inner Realms are also distinct in that the energy of the Riving still echoes around them, creating the magic that sustains the [Echo Realms](<echo-realms/echo-realms.md>). 

Contrast with the [Outer Realms](<./outer-realms.md>).

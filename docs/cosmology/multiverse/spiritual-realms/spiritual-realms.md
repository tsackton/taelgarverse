# The Spiritual Realms

The realms of the creations of belief - the gods and demons born of the belief or humanity, and the embodied gods created by the high gods themselves, inhabit the spiritual realms. 

These include:
  - The primal realms, associated with the first days of humanity when belief was strong and curses, madness, hope, and beauty could all engender realms. 
  - The divine realms, homes of the gods
  - The proximate realms, that make up the borders between the material plane and the spiritual realms

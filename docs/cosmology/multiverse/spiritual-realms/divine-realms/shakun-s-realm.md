### Shakun's Realm

A spiritual realm associated with [Shakun](<../../../gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>). Accessible from [Shakun’s Wellspring](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/shakuns-wellspring.md>), on the southern edge of the [Red Mesa](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/red-mesa.md>). Here, a portal lies that is open for a short time around dawn and dusk each day.

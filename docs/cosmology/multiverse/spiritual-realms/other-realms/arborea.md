# Arborea
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A plane in the [Spiritual Realms](<../spiritual-realms.md>)  
</div>


Arborea is the plane of wildness, nature, and beasts, a place where the beauty of vast untouched landscapes coexists with the terror of the hunt and the chaotic energy of overgrown jungles. It is an ancient realm among the [Outer Realms](<../../outer-realms.md>), not associated with any particular divinity.


There is a known [extraplanar weak point](<../../extraplanar-weak-point.md>) connecting Arborea to the [Material Plane](<../../material-plane.md>) underneath the [Lakan Monastery](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/lakan-monastery.md>), south of [Tokra](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>).

# Outer Realms

The Outer Realms are those planes beyond the [Land of the Dead](<spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>) that are made of, and sustained by, ~soulstuff~, and thus places where the souls of the dead can exist, and thrive, without a living body and without the unnatural magic of undeath. 

Creatures native to an Outer Realm cannot be permanently killed except in an Outer Realm, and the powers of the Outer Realms have limited ability to affect the Inner Realms directly. 

The outer realms are often depicted as bubbles in the sea of the [Astral Plane](<./astral-plane.md>), and can be reached by skilled travelers through that plane.

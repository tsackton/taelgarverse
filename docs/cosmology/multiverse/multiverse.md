A variety of planes surround and extend from the [Material Plane](<./material-plane.md>), together making up the Multiverse. 

While there are many ways to describe the multiverse, the most widely known comes from elven scholars, who describe the multiverse a pair of intersecting domes: the below, the dome of the physical planes rising from the roiling chaos of the [Plane of Magic](<energy-realms/plane-of-magic.md>); above, the dome of the planes of sentience, descending from the blinding intensity of the Plane of Creation.  

The duality of the [Material Plane](<./material-plane.md>) -- the physical structures of the universe -- and the [Plane of Souls](<./plane-of-souls.md>) -- the soul structures of the sentient inhabitants of the universe -- sit in the middle of these domes, the Material Plane anchored to the dome of physicality, the Plane of Souls anchored to the dome of sentience. 

Descending "below" the material plane in this cosmology is the [Ethereal Plane](<energy-realms/ethereal-plane.md>), which stretches from the border ethereal, co-localizing with the material plane, through the interior ethereal, a foggy expanse of swirling mists, to the deep ethereal, which bleeds into the [Plane of Magic](<energy-realms/plane-of-magic.md>). Embedded within the "sea" of the [Ethereal Plane](<energy-realms/ethereal-plane.md>) are the [Energy Realms](<energy-realms/energy-realms.md>), chief among them the Elemental Planes, domains of pure physicality, capturing the essence of the fundamental elements of the universe. 

Floating "above" the plane of souls in this cosmology is the [Astral Plane](<spiritual-realms/astral-plane.md>), which is bisected by the [Land of the Dead](<spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>), a collecting point for souls and an not-quite-impermeable barrier separating the raw energy of creation from the [Material Plane](<./material-plane.md>). Beyond the [Land of the Dead](<spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>), the [Astral Plane](<spiritual-realms/astral-plane.md>) is a strange empty expanse of silvery waves, in which the [Spiritual Realms](<spiritual-realms/spiritual-realms.md>) float like bubbles, until it merges with the blinding energy of the Plane of Creation. 

Layered on top of this cosmology, the elven scholars speak of the Echo Realms, the distortions and reflections and reverberations of the planes created by the [Riving](<../../events/ancient/riving.md>), which still resonance today. Most notably, these include the [Feywild](<echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), an echo of the material plane, and the [Dreamworld](<echo-realms/dreamworld.md>), an echo of the plane of souls, but others have been described, including the domains of the [Shadowfell](<echo-realms/shadowfell/shadowfell.md>), the [Nightmare Realm](<echo-realms/nightmare-realm.md>), and the [Mirror Realm](<echo-realms/mirror-realm.md>). 






 the metaphysics needs a little more thought - Echo Realms and Energy Realms are clear enough but it isn't obvious that titans who flee, or great wyrms, make sense to end up in one of those places.  note: see below about orcs; possible to move Thark's creation if it should align with creation of orcs

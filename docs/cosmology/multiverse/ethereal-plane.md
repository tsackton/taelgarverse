# Ethereal Plane



The Ethereal Plane is a strange realm of mists and fog that stretches from the borders of the Material Plane to unknown depths. It is rumored that a skilled traveler in the Ethereal Plane can reach any of the Energy Realms, even the Plane of Magic itself, but few are foolhardy enough to leave the safe confines of the Ethereal shores, where the ghostly, permeable echoes of the material plane can still be perceived.

# Ley Lines

Ley lines are the scars of the [Riving](<../../events/ancient/riving.md>), when the arcane energy of the [Plane of Magic](<./plane-of-magic.md>) was ripped from the material plane, leaving behind a patchwork mess through which arcane magic still leaks into the world, for those with skill to channel. 

Many scholars consider these a type of [extraplanar weak point](<./extraplanar-weak-point.md>).

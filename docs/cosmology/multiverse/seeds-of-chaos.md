# Seeds of Chaos

One theorized mechanism that can create [extraplanar weak points](<./extraplanar-weak-point.md>), or similar kinds of extraplanar incursions. Thought to be the after effects of the death of powerful beings that exist across planes, such as [elder wyrms](<../../species/children-of-the-divine/dragons.md>). 

[Cha'mutte](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s death in DR 1545 was thought to scatter seeds of chaos across the [Plaguelands](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/plaguelands.md>), responsible for the curse that lingers on that land.

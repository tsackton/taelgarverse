The Elemental Plane of Fire is one of the [Inner Realms](<../../../inner-realms.md>) separated from the [Material Plane](<../../../material-plane.md>) during the [Riving](<../../../../../events/ancient/riving.md>). 

It is said that certain volcanos on the Material Plane are connected to the Plane of Fire.

# The Energy Realms
>[!info]+ Information  
>> 

The Energy Realms are the collective name for the [Inner Realms](<../inner-realms.md>) that are associated with the raw magical energy separated from the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>) during the [Riving](<../../../events/ancient/riving.md>). The Energy Realms are embedded in the material of the [Ethereal Plane](<../ethereal-plane.md>), which indirectly links them to the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>). The most well known -- and possibly only -- of the Energy Realms are the [Elemental Realms](<elemental-realms/elemental-realms.md>).

# The Shadowfolds
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Domains of the [Echo Realms](<../echo-realms.md>)  
</div>


The Shadowfolds are series of echo realms, domains of undeath, despair, sorrow, or other curses and evils, created from the echos of the [Material Plane](<../../material-plane.md>) by powerful events of evil. There are many such domains, and unlike the [Feywild](<../feywild/feywild.md>) they do not connect in a single, cohesive realm: it is, generally, not possible to simply walk from one domain to another. 

However, all of the Shadowfolds share the property of being an echo realm of the Material Plane.

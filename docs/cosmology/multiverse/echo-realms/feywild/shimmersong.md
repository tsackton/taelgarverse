# Shimmersong

The fey domain of Shimmersong is a land of bright colors and vivid magic. It is hilly terrain, with pillars of bright gems, crystal forests on rolling slopes, glittering caves, spiders that spin webs of diamond. There is the occasional mountain, and the occasional hidden valley of lush plant life in rich, multicolored soil. Mostly it is a riot of color, and full of oddities that mix crystals/gems with living things, so there might be trees on which ruby apples grow, or a crystal tree that produces real citrus, or a deer with antlers of silver instead of bone.

[Lord Egon](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lightdancer.md>), the [Lightdancer](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lightdancer.md>) (they/them pronouns) is a vivacious, almost madcap ruler, obsessed with the vibrancy of their domain. Anything dull, flat, colorless, is considered out of place, and the [Lightdancer](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lightdancer.md>) can transmute life to crystal or crystal to life with their touch, turning lemons into topaz or emeralds into juicy fruits. 

But [Egon](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lightdancer.md>) has a dark side, and for some time each year they retreat to hidden caves underground, color fades from the domain, and many of the vibrant plants and animals of the realm turn to stone and metal. There is a stark, winter beauty to this time, but for many in Shimmersong it is hard, and for those who would wish the denizens of the domain ill it is an opportunity. 

To keep the domain safe during the dark times, the [Lightdancer](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lightdancer.md>) has company of Winter Knights, a group that rarely emerges during the bright days of light and song, but revels in the harsh beauty when the [Lightdancer](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lightdancer.md>) retreats, and keeps the domain safe from anyone who would take advantage.

The people of Shimmersong are grateful to the Winter Knights, but most are eager for the Awakening, the ceremony of springtime that marks the [Lightdancer](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lightdancer.md>)’s return and honors the work of the Winter Knights during the days of grayness and sleep.

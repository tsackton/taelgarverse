Once the realm of a powerful fey, since the end of the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) it has been uninhabited and dangerous. Little is known of what is here, but it is powerful and dangerous enough that even the [Lightdancer](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lightdancer.md>) and [Lord Umbraeth](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/lord-umbraeth.md>), the lords of two neighboring realms, and enemies, for the most part, have unified several times to defend against incursions.

What these incursions are even the fey lords will not explain.

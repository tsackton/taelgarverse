# Amberglow
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Fey](<../../../../species/children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>) realm in the [Feywild](<./feywild.md>), the Echo Realms  
</div>


On the southern and eastern borders of [Shimmersong](<./shimmersong.md>) is the fey realm of Amberglow. Once a place of great beauty, a land of constant sunsets and golden skies on wide open plains of amber grasses and lush flowers, it has fallen into decay.

The queen of Amberglow, known as the [Cloudspinner](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>), the Queen of Sunsets, vanished, and in her absence the realm decayed. Though some servants and allies of the Cloudspinnerâ€™s court remain, most of the realm is a place few dare tread.

The echo realm of the fey, home to the realms of the Archfey and the [Fey](<../../../../species/children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>)
## Locations

The politics and political organization of the Feywild is based around the realms of the Archfey, such as [Shimmersong](<./shimmersong.md>), [Amberglow](<./amberglow.md>), [Fortune's Rest](<./fortune-s-rest.md>) or other lesser known realms.

The layout and terrain of the Feywild very loosely matches the layout and terrain of the material plane of Taelgar; so where there are big mountain chains in Taelgar, there are usually mountains of some kind in the Feywild. But this matching is very loose, and often based more on vibes or history than physical geography. 

Roughly, the locations of the following Fey realms are known:
- [Fortune's Rest](<./fortune-s-rest.md>) is superimposed on the area southeast of [Chardon](<../../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), roughly including the southern reaches of [the Elderwood](<../../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>), the [Yeraad](<../../../../gazetteer/west-coast/rivers/yeraad.md>) river valley, and the lowlands leading to the [Myraeni Gap](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/myraeni-gap.md>). 
- [Shimmersong](<./shimmersong.md>) is east of [Fortune's Rest](<./fortune-s-rest.md>), covering roughly the [Myraeni Gap](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/myraeni-gap.md>) and the southern reaches of the [Sentinels](<../../../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), extending into the northern part of the Dunmari plains. 
- [Amberglow](<./amberglow.md>) stretches east and south from [Shimmersong](<./shimmersong.md>), centered on the [Kharja](<../../../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/rivers/kharja.md>) river valley and extending south into the [Garamjala Desert](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>), as well as east towards the Mahar drainage. 
- [Dreamhaven](<./dreamhaven.md>) is north of [Fortune's Rest](<./fortune-s-rest.md>), centered around the ancient elven kingdom of [Ainumarya](<../../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/ainumarya.md>) and the northern reaches of the [Chasa](<../../../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/chasa.md>) river valley.
- [Whispervale](<./whispervale.md>) is north of [Dreamhaven](<./dreamhaven.md>), roughly congruent with the lands now occupied by the northern Deno'qai, along the edge of them mountains.
- Splendor's Gleam is a small realm, roughly congruent with the northern edge of Lake Valandros and the southern part of the [Voltara](<../../../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/northern-frontier/voltara.md>) plains. 
- Wildrun is north and west of Splendor's Gleam, roughly congruent with the Tawir Forest and the Mawarkel Peninsula.
- [Sharpspire](<./sharpspire.md>) is north of [Shimmersong](<./shimmersong.md>) and west of [Duskmire](<./duskmire.md>), and is centered around [Urlich Pass](<../../../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/urlich-pass.md>). The realm has fallen since the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and is now a no-mans-land
- [Duskmire](<./duskmire.md>), is east of [Sharpspire](<./sharpspire.md>) and north of [Amberglow](<./amberglow.md>), centered on the western parts of Sembara and the [Duchy of Maseau](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>)
- [Twilight's Grace](<./twilight-s-grace.md>), the domain of [Archfey Ethlenn](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey-ethlenn.md>), congruent with [Tyrwingha](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>)

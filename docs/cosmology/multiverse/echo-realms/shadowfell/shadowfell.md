The Shadowfell is the collective name for a series of echo realms, domains of undeath, despair, sorrow, or other curses and evils, created from the echos of the Material Plane by powerful events of evil. 

There are many Shadowfell domains, and unlike the Feywild they do not connect in a single, cohesive realm: it is, generally, not possible to simply walk from one domain to another. 

However, all Shadowfell domains share the property of being an echo realm of the Material Plane.

# Dreamworld
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A plane in the [Echo Realms](<./echo-realms.md>), [Multiverse](<../multiverse.md>)  
</div>


The Dreamworld is a strange echo of the [Plane of Souls](<../plane-of-souls.md>), a place where time is unpredictable and all the imaginings of all the sentient beings who have or ever will live are reflected in dreams.

The Echo Realms refer to the planes that came into existence due to the echoes of the energy of the [Riving](<../../../events/ancient/riving.md>). These planes are somewhat mysterious, but are thought to share two key properties. 

First, they are always [Inner Realms](<../inner-realms.md>), and so bounded from the influence of the raw energy of creation by the [River of Souls](<../spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>). 

Second, they are traditionally thought to be reflections, distortions, or echoes of another plane, and not have a unique existence of their own. For example, the geography of the [Feywild](<feywild/feywild.md>) maps, in at least a metaphorical sense, to the geography of the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>): a mountainous region in the material world is likely to be echoed by mountains, or something like mountains, in the Feywild. 

The most well-known of the echo realms are the [Feywild](<feywild/feywild.md>), an echo of the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>), and the [Dreamworld](<./dreamworld.md>), an echo of the [Plane of Souls](<../plane-of-souls.md>). However, others have been rumored to exist, including the [Mirror Realm](<./mirror-realm.md>), the numerous domains of despair, undeath, and dread collectively referred to as the Planes of Shadow or sometimes the Shadowfolds, and the [Nightmare Realm](<./nightmare-realm.md>).

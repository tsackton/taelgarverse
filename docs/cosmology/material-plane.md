The Material Plane, sometimes called the Prime Material Plane or simply the Prime Realm, is the name traditionally given to the plane in which the world of Taelgar, and possibly other words, exist. The Material Plane, along with its spiritual counterpart the [Plane of Souls](<./plane-of-souls.md>), is considered by almost all scholars to be the center of the [Multiverse](<./multiverse.md>). This pair of planes - the material and the spiritual - is where the [Astral Plane](<./astral-plane.md>) and [Ethereal Plane](<./ethereal-plane.md>) intersect, and is believed by theological cosmologists to be the home for life to thrive created by the [Divine Presence](<../gods-and-religions/gods/high-gods/divine-presence.md>) during the [Riving](<../events/ancient/riving.md>). 

>[!danger] Minority Opinions about the Material Plane
>Despite the clear centrality of the Material Plane in most multiversal models, there remain some scholars who question the standard depictions accepted by both arcane and theological cosmologists.
> #### The Yendalist Heresy
>Some radical Yendalists insist it is wrong to believe the Material Plane and the [Plane of Souls](<./plane-of-souls.md>) are at the center of the [Multiverse](<./multiverse.md>). They argue the correct cosmological structure puts the [Land of the Dead](<./land-of-the-dead.md>) at the center of the [Multiverse](<./multiverse.md>), which they call the [Divine Veil](<./land-of-the-dead.md>), with the physical [Inner Realms](<planar-concepts/inner-realms.md>)  and the spiritual [Outer Realms](<planar-concepts/outer-realms.md>) extending below and above the dividing line of the [Land of the Dead](<./land-of-the-dead.md>), respectively. In this depiction, the Material Plane, though it seems important to those who call it home, is not metaphysically special, and is simply another of the [Energy Realms](<energy-realms/energy-realms.md>). Followers of Yendalism, however, have no answer when asked why the Material Plane, alone of all the supposedly similar [Energy Realms](<energy-realms/energy-realms.md>), is paired with the [Plane of Souls](<./plane-of-souls.md>).
>#### The Mundane World
>It must be noted that many fey find the standard depictions of cosmology that place the Material Plane in the center of the [Multiverse](<./multiverse.md>) to be quite amusing. The fey often refer to the Material Plane as the Mundane World or the Mundane Realm, considering it a pale, diminished echo or distortion of their own, admittedly more magical, home of the [Feywild](<./feywild.md>).  However, no serious scholarship accepts the Material Plane itself as an [Echo Realm](<demiplanes-and-echo-realms/echo-realms.md>) of the [Feywild](<./feywild.md>).

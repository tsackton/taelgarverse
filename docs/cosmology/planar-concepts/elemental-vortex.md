# Elemental Vortex

An Elemental Vortex, as defined in The Seams Between Worlds, Ishara Venn's study of planar connections, is a temporary locus of connection between the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>) and an [Energy Realms](<../energy-realms/energy-realms.md>), created by the presence of a nearly-pure representation of one of the [Five Fundamental Energies](<../energy-realms/energy-realms.md>), which, according to Ishara, draws the [Energy Realms](<../energy-realms/energy-realms.md>) closer in extraplanar space to the [Material Plane](<../material-plane.md>), often forcing them to touch and creating a temporary portal. Although many folktales and legends speak of people vanishing mysteriously, and sometimes returning later speaking of being carried off to a strange place, few planar geographers find Ishara's theories convincing, and elemental vortexes are considered something of a fringe idea among the Faculty of Metaphysics. 

Emyr of Tafolwern, unlike many other planar geographers, argued that Ishara Venn's work, rather than being merely a codification of myths and folklore, in fact did not go far enough. He argued in his forceful polemic On Hidden Doors that elemental vortexes are obviously part of a larger class of temporary planar connections, uniting what he considered obviously true tales of temporary [Feywild](<../feywild.md>) connections with Ishara's work on elemental vortexes. In this theory, planes are constantly drifting in space, and such phenomenon as diverse as unexpected volcanoes, terrifying hurricanes, and strange fey melodies drifting in the air are all symptoms of temporary planar proximity, often resulting in temporary portals as well. Indeed, Emyr of Tafolwern claimed that this planar drift is, in part, why permanent portals sometimes appear, or disappear, in ways that are not clearly explicable by scholarly study. 


[Kaeso](<../../people/chardonians/kaeso.md>) believes that [Shakun's Protection](<../../gods-and-religions/religions/five-siblings/shakun-s-protection.md>) is also akin to an elemental vortex. It is a temporary kind of planar connection, controlled by [Shakun](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/shakun.md>) herself to draw enemies of [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) into her [extraplanar realm](<../spiritual-realms/shakun-s-realm.md>), that, although different in appearance and purpose, bears many similarities with legends of elemental vortexes. In particular, Kaeso was intrigued by the apparent ability of [Shakun's Protection](<../../gods-and-religions/religions/five-siblings/shakun-s-protection.md>) to lure the unsuspected across a planar boundary unaware, something that traditional portals seem unlikely to achieve and yet is a common feature of tales of elemental vortexes. Kaeso was forced to resign from the [Society of the Open Scroll](<../../groups/chardonian-organizations/society-of-the-open-scroll.md>) for refusing to share the details of these theories, as that would reveal the secrets of the [Shakun Mystai](<../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/shakun-mystai.md>) that he had sworn to uphold. 


The ultimate truth of these rumored planar connections, and the metaphysics that may or may not underlie them, remains, however, a mystery.

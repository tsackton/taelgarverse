# Seeds of Chaos


The Seeds of Chaos are a term used by the [Hero of the Great War](<../../people/pcs/great-war/heroes-of-the-great-war.md>) [Rai](<../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>), and later by the Dunmari monks of the [Order of the Awakened Soul](<../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/order-of-the-awakened-soul.md>), to describe the fragments of extraplanar chaos scattered across the [Plaguelands](<../../gazetteer/upper-istaros/plaguelands.md>), and perhaps elsewhere, by the death of [Cha'mutte](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>). Although the exact metaphysics of these seeds of chaos is not understand, [Rai](<../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>) theorized that these fragments of [Cha'mutte](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s essence functioned as seeds through which [extraplanar weak points](<./extraplanar-weak-point.md>), or even [elemental vortexes](<./elemental-vortex.md>), connected to [Limbo](<../spiritual-realms/limbo.md>) and the [Abyss](<../spiritual-realms/abyss.md>) (the planes most associated with Cha'mutte), grew. 

Rai, however, apparently never returned from his [encounter](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/dreams-and-visions/second-dream-of-rai.md>) with these fragments of [Cha'mutte](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s essence.

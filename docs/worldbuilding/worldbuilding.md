title: WorldBuilding
---

This folder contains background and brainstorming information and is not intended to be published directly to a website. Broadly, it is organized as follows:
* Background should be considered canonical, but is often in rough note form and potentially needs work to incorporate into proper notes. Alternatively, it may be behind the scenes information that doesn't really make sense in any particular note but helps inform the world building process
* Brainstorming is for raw ideas, in various states of development. Nothing in this folder is canonical. Anything in brainstorming that contradicts with a real note can probably just be deleted.
* High School Notes is for extracted notes and information from the high school iteration of Taelgar. It is explicitly non-canonical, although certain aspects of the high school version of Taelgar are incorporated into the canonical information
* Tentative is "proper" notes that represent people, places, etc, but where the thing shouldn't be considered definitely canonical. This is different than just things that don't have a name, it is more for things that perhaps were made up for a game but never came up, or a place that was made up for fun but doesn't have a definitive home

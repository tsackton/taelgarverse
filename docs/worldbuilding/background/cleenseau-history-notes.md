title: Cleenseau History Notes
---


### Before Drankor
The town of [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) is chiefly famous for an enormous stone bridge crossing the [Enst](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). This bridge is wide enough for 4 carts and runs straight and smooth and high over the river, and even in the worst storms and floods it has never been damaged.

Some ideas about its origin:
* It was created by giants for mysterious reasons in the aftermath of the [Downfall](<../../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>)
* It was created by Drankorian mages to assist the conquest of Sembara and/or the [Highland Conquest Wars](<../../events/400s/highland-conquest-wars.md>)
* It is a projection or echo of some other realm, i.e. the Plane of Earth

In game, the rumor of giants has been mentioned. 

### Drankorian Period
There was a Drankorian town on this site, originally founded as a frontier garrison (perhaps because the bridge was there) in DR 360. The Drankorian town presumably thrived and had an interesting history, but that is largely irrelevant now.

However a ruined stone tower on the south bank of the [Enst](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) dates to the late 300s when this was a large supply depot and bustling Drankorian garrison during the conquest of Sembara.

This tower was built with powerful protective magic, and it was only in the 1420s when Avatus sacked the town that the protective magic was broken and the tower fell.

### The Dark Ages and Early Sembara
After the [First Plague](<../../events/1000s/1059/first-plague.md>) the entire area was in upheaval. Cleenseau was far enough north that it wasn't consumed in the actual destruction of the Empire, but there must have been many disruptions.

The halfling community, if you could question them, would tell you that during this time they started wintering here, sometimes, as the bridge was a convenient crossing spot over the river, and that although the main human town, such as it was, on was on the south bank, the halflings had a small seasonal settlement on the north bank. This was the first even semi-permanent settlement here, and [Marigold Stonebridge](<../../people/halflings/marigold-stonebridge.md>), might, if the mood struck her, claim that [The Crossroads Inn](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/the-crossroads-inn.md>) was built on the site of this ancient halfling settlement. The Stonebridges have certainly been in this area for time immemorial, and Marigold has a deed dated DR 1332 from a Lord Tanrreck (a vassal of the Duke of Wisford) indicating the Stonebridge ownership of the several acres of land by "ancient family right".

## The Great War and Blood Years
In the early 1420s, when Avatus is moving north, he captures the old Drankorian fort on the south bank of the river first, and uses magically dimension door to teleport his troops across the river and eventually defeats the Sembaran army. Cleeenseau at this time is not a significant fortification but it becomes a central staging point for the army in the war with Avatus, until the Sembarans are defeated.

During the war with [Avatus](<../../people/historical-figures/avatus.md>) Cleenseau is captured, but Avatus is seeking conquest and subjects, not revenge, and so the population is largely enslaved. He makes a particular deal with the Stonebridges to allow them to continue running the Crossroads Inn as a watering hole for hobgoblins. The halflings secretly aid humans wishing to escape hobgoblin rule, and several tunnels are built under the Crossroads Inn to assist this.

When Avatus is defeated the town is recaptured largely intact, although the Drankorian fortifications are ruined.

During the later 1450s the town is resettled as trade between Isingue and Sembara grows, although it is a peaceful place and no garrison or walls are built. The Great War does not reach this far north, and for the most part Cleenseau is untouched, save for the men and women who leave to fight and die and never return.  However, in 1546, as the hobgoblin threat in the south grows, [Derik III](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-iii.md>) establishes the first military garrison here and some substantial fortifications are built a bit to the east of the Crossroads Inn.

This garrison is substantially increased in the 1550s during and after the Blood Plague, as Cleenseau becomes more of a border town and the road south to Maseau becomes more dangerous. Town walls are built, although smaller than the current walls (and the Crossroads Inn is outside them). 

## The Hobgoblin Wars

The First Hobgoblin War is largely fought to the north of Cleenseau, and some of its garrison is pulled into the fighting. Little is remembered from that time but as Cleenseau was a very military town with a large garrison, many people would have lost relatives. 

The Second Hobgoblin War is fought just south of the Enst, and Cleenseau was a major garrison and logistics point for the armies fighting to the south, as the only safe river crossing for many miles. The Sembaran general, as the battles were going badly, even tried to destory the bridge to protect Sembara but it was undestrucible. Maybe this cursed the garrison for some period of time.

After Treaty of Châteauclair in 1602, the Second Hobgoblin War ends and the [Shattered Ice Clan](<../../groups/hobgoblin-clans/shattered-ice-clan.md>) is established just south of Cleenseau, and trade largly ceases. The walls are strengthened, taking many stones from the (at the time) somewhat intact Drankorian fort on the south bank of the Enst. The next 40 years, until the Third Hobgoblin War starts in 1644, are tense and highly fortified.

In spring DR 1647, during the darkest period of the Third Hobgoblin War, Cleenseau is sacked and conqueored by the hobgoblins. The entire population is put to death, and the hobgoblins massively fortify it as a "beachhead" on the north side of the Enst from which many raids are launched. In particular, the build a hillfort on top of the old Sembaran garrison, and a wall that incorporates the Crossroads Inn, which is used as a headquarters and feasting hall. The entire area around Cleenseau is depopulated as either hobgoblin raids kill people or they flee to safer places.

In the early spring of DR 1649, Cece reconqueors the town and it is a large staging spot for military campaigns to the south, but no population returns. In DR 1651 Cece gives the lordship of Cleenseau to one of her young army captains, [Reginald Essford](<../../people/historical-figures/reginald-essford.md>) in honor of his heroic service, and he builds [Essford Manor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/essford-manor.md>) on the ruins of the hobgoblin fortifications. 

The Stonebridges return, and the Crossroads Inn (still standing, having been used as a hobgoblin headquarters) is cleansed and returned to service as an inn.

Over the 1650s the wall is rebuild, and the garrison reestablished, and the [Reginald Essford](<../../people/historical-figures/reginald-essford.md>) manages the place well and Cleenseau thrives, and grows.

### Some Specific Buildings

* The Crossroads Inn was built in 1332 and survived Avatus and the Shattered Ice Clan. It was used as a place to help humans escape from Avatus during the 
* The military garrison was built in three stages. The 'old fort' dates to the 1550s, 'Elaine's fort' dates to the 1590s and was built for the 2nd hobgoblin war, and the 'new fort' dates to the 1650s when the garrison was reduced 
* Smith's Way was originally part of the halfling land grant and attached to the Crossroads Inn. A few of the buildings are likely connected by the old secret tunnels
* The old wall went from the North Gate south-east across what is now Essford Manor. Much of the wall to the east is still called the old wall.  This was first built in the 1550s and repaired many times
* The new wall was built in 1655 - 1659 after the construction of Essford Manor. The River Gate was newly built, replacing the old South Gate, and the North Gate replaced the old Farmer's Gate. Much of the stones from the South Gate were used to built the archway and door to the Garrison Quarter along Char Street
* Two major military forts no longer exist:
	* The main garrison of the Sembaran army from 1550 - 1645 was built around where Essford Manor and Underhill are. The 'old fort' was a secondary garrison built around the wall, more of a gatehouse than anything else
	* In 1646-1647 the Shattered Ice Clan built a motte on top of, and incorporating, the old Sembaran fortifications. Two towers were built before the motte, and the motte buried them, and then additional fortificaitons were built over the motte
* Essford Manor was built in 1651 - 1660 in a couple of stages, on top of the old hobgoblin motte
* Underhill was the ruins of the old sembaran and hobgoblin forts and not very well built up until the 1670s and 1680s when the population started to grow  many of the buildings incorporate stones from the old forts
* Most of the nicer buildings in the garrison quarter date to the 1550s - 1590s and were converted from various garrison buildings in the 1660s. Land grants of relatively large and intact buildings was a key way [Reginald Essford](<../../people/historical-figures/reginald-essford.md>) grew the town rapidly
* [The Bandit’s End](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/the-bandits-end.md>) was built in the 1650s originally to house laborers working on rebuilding the town It was converted to an inn in the 1660s
* [The Fox's Flagon](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/the-fox-s-flagon.md>) was built in 1689 as a business venture
* [The River’s Blessing](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/the-rivers-blessing.md>) was built in 1709 after a bad flood damaged the other two outside the wall inns, originally as a temporary venture by halflings but it was then sold to the current owner in 1710

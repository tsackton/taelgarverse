title: Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte
---

the western army is more deliberate moving through human lands, establishing a series of hobgoblin kingdoms, perhaps under the overlordship of a high king or something (details not super relevant) through the 1550s. defeated by chardon as well (in my notes have this actually in 1551, but probably would realistically be a decade or more later) but this is just a retreat, not a full defeat, since there are hobgoblin kingdoms to retreat to. over the next 50 years or something, chardon slowly marches north, freeing the surviving human populations from hobgoblin rule - details unclear    (except in context of mawar, where the mawar renaissance was in the early 1600s, so hobgoblin threat must be largely gone by then, but chardon dominance not yet fully established)

in any case, postulating a serious split in cha'mutte's armies between these eastern and western branches, the timing would work for the survivors of eastern army to flee over the mountains in the 1570s-1580s

this all works with your shattered ice clan and then a war in the 1580s on the western frontier of sembara

haven't figured out what happened to the western hobgoblin kingdoms; would prefer to leave that undetermined for now. you might learn more when you go after the piece of rai under the ocean off the coast of that peninsula.   but chardon would have not let any escape south, i don't think

other key things: 
* (south) Iron Fang against Sembara in 1550s
* (south) Bitter Knife against Dunmar in 1550s - 1570s
* (south) Blackened Claw against Dunmar, 1603 - 1610
* (north-from-Chardon) Shattered Ice against Sembara 1570s

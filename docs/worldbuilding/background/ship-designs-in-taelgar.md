A few notes about ship designs.

1. The Chardonian Navy relies typically on large, square-rigged ships with oars for backup power and maneuverability in naval engagements.
2. Illorian designs tend more towards small, lanteen-rigged ships. 
3. Halfling ships tend to be fast and complex, capable of sailing quite far into the wind.

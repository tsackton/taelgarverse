This document tracks real-world language inspiration that we have tended to use for inventing names in Taelgar. 

# General Notes

The major linguistic trends in Taelgar are based around the following assumptions:
- Non-human species, with the possible exception of goblinoids, magically have fixed, unchanging languages derived from their creators (whether embodied gods, children of the divine, or something else).
- Humans, when created, spoke a shared language, Hkaran. Modern "trade tongues" are descended from this. 
- Local languages are primarily influenced by the Drankorian empire, and by the mariner migrations.

As far as game mechanics go:
- Linguistic variation is mostly used for names, to give different places a different feel. Most (all?) humans can be assumed to speak a trade tongue, so only venturing very far away from "home" makes communication fundamentally difficult, although of course any group of NPCs may choose to speak in their local language, and optionally interactions in "trade tongues" may require slightly higher DCs.

# Human Languages

Human trade tongues languages are driven by four migrations: 
- the early departures, humans who mostly settled west of the Sentinel Range
- the "middle waves", which may eventually represent more separate migrations but currently includes primarily the Dunmari and the undeveloped "southerners"
- the mariners, a late migration who settled the Green Sea
- the flight of the magical urbanists who fled the sinking of Hkar and founded Drankor

## Trade Tongues

### First departures
These are the cultures of the Deno'qai, and other groups now living in the northern parts of the West Coast region; Mawar and the Sembaran Highland Kingdoms have some cultural influences as well. 

**Trade Tongue**: *Northros* (tentative name), now extinct. Generally, local languages descended from or influenced by *Northros* have real world mappings to various **Semitic** languages. 

### Middle waves
The only developed descendants of these are the Dunmari, who adopted Common, so what trade tongue the middle waves may have spoken is undetermined. See Dunmari below for more about the Dunmari

### Mariner migrations
These are the cultures along the Green Sea, with varying degrees of influence from other cultures.

**Trade tongue**: *Eastros* (tentative name). Currently spoken generally in Irrla and further east in the Eastern Green Sea, although it can be heard in Skaerhem and Vostok, and occasionally other places in the western Green Sea. Generally, local languages descended from or influenced by *Eastros* have real world mappings to various **Scandinavian** or **Slavic** languages. 

### Final flight
These are the culture that established Drankor, and all the influence that flowed from that. 

**Trade tongue**: *Common, or Westros* (tentative name). Currently spoken in Dunmar, Chardon, and the western Green Sea. Generally, local languages descended from or influenced by *Common* have real world mappings to various *Romance* or *Germanic* languages.

## Local languages
Moving roughly west to east.

### Drankorian
Once spoken across almost the entire "known world" map, now considered a "scholarly" tongue only. Real world mapping "Classical" sounding, but varying between *Greek* and *Latin*. 

#### Chardonian
Descended from Drankorian. Includes a number of languages spoken in now-destroyed West Coast realms, pre-Great-War. Real world mapping: generally I have leaned *Latin* for Chardon itself, with a bit more *Italian* in the north while also mixing in the occasional other "classical" things, so bits of *Greek* in particular. 

#### Sembaran
This is a mix of Drankorian with the local elements, especially the mariners. Real world mapping: *English*. Tyrwinghan is considered a dialect, and maps to *Welsh/Celtic*. 

Generally, I have considered **Sembaran**, **Cymean**, and **Isinguese** to represent a shared "language" as far as D&D is concerned, and just use the differences for naming. Chardonian is its own thing. 

#### Cymean
A bit more "pure" Drankorian. Maps to *Spanish*, mostly, with some *Italian*. 

#### Isinguese
Maps to *French*

### Mariner-influenced languages
Common particularly in the parts of the Green Sea not conquered by Drankor. Uses a different alphabet from Drankorian-influenced languages (but more like Greek/English differences than English/Japanese or something). 

#### Vos
A collection of languages spoken in the Skaer islands, Vostok, and the Sembaran highlands. Presumably these are dialects, not separate "languages" as far as mechanics are concerned. Maps to a variety of northern European and Slavic languages, without much consistency: *Finnish* (Skaer in particular), *Swedish*, *Norwegian*, plus various eastern European *Slavic* tongues.

#### Urskan
Not much decided here, except *Russian* place names.

#### Others
Nothing really developed about Irrla, ~Eastern Islands~, Medju, MTP, etc

### Dunmari
Generally assumed to be a fairly distinct language, although adopted Common and the Common alphabet. Maps generally to *Hindi* but I've also used other *Indo-Iranian* languages like *Persian*. 

### Northerner-influenced
Generally have used *Hebrew*, *Arabic*, or other *Semitic* languages here. Mostly have assumed that there is one "Northerner" langauge that covered dialects including Deno'qai, Mawar, and others. These use a separate alphabet from Drankorian/Chardonian/Common. Or, perhaps, use the Elvish alphabet. 

# Non-human languages

These are mostly based on how they sound, not carefully thought out language family ideas.

## Elder Folk

- Elven: although several dialects of Elven exist, they are all mutually intelligible, even among the widespread elves who may be living on other continents. Real world mapping: Tolkien Elvish
- Dwarven: the dwarven language has remained essentially unchanged since the dawn of time, and so no other dialects of dwarven exist. However, when the gnomes left, they gradually developed their own language. Real world mapping: Tolkien Dwarvish
- Lizardling: ??. Real world mapping: Basque
- Stoneborn: ??. Real world mapping: Xhosan
- Halfling: the halflings' language is preserved and learned via the racial consciousness; a single dialect covers all halflings across the world, even on diverse continents. The halflings rarely, if ever, teach their secretive language to outsiders. Real world mapping: considering Igbo
- Orcish: ??. For free orcs I've used kind of vaguely central Asian/Turkic/eastern European but that may be different from other orcs. 

## Other racesÂ 


- Goblin: goblinoids of all types. Real world mapping: Slavic-ish, but may change this, also influenced by Black Speech.
- Giant: trolls, giants, ogres. Real world mapping: Old Norse as much as possible.
- Kenku: Used vaguely Sioux for eastern islands Kenku, but does not need to reflect all kenku.
- Centaurs: mostly have used Greek. 
- Deep Speech: the language of the mind flayers, and used to communicate with their various slave races and underdark creations, such as derro, grimlock, and quaggoth; also shared with some similar alien underdark creatures such as the beholder and the grell (who speak a corrupted variant form, referred to as Grell)
- Gnoll: a hideous combination of Abyssal and a magical beast tongue of hyenas; can attempt to understand if you speak Abyssal
- Bullywug: spoken by bullywugs mostly
- Low Draconic: related to draconic; used by kobolds, minor dragons, and related creatures. Real world mapping: undecided

## Extraplanar languages

- Sylvan: spoken by fey creatures, those native to the Feywild. Real world mapping is often classical Greek.   
- Shadowkar: spoken by shadow creatures, those native to the Shadowfell 
- Aquan: spoken by those native to the Plane of Water
- Auran: spoken by those native to the Plane of Air
- Terran: spoken by those native to the Plane of Earth
- Ignan: spoken by those native to the Plane of Fire
- Abyssal: spoken by those native to the abyss, primarily demons, but also some of their demon-spawn, such as Xvarts and gnolls
- Infernal: spoken by those native to the Nine Hells, primarily devils
- Celestial: spoken by those native to the divine domains
- High Draconic: spoken by dragons, the language of magic and elder wyrms

A collection of canonical facts about the Underdark, here defined as the extensive underground area beneath the [Sentinel Range](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>).


- **Dwarven long roads**: dwarven cities are connected by long roads, as they are called, that run for hundreds or thousands of miles underground. While historically they connected dwarven kingdoms, now they provide easy passage for aberrations of the deep to travel, find people invading the mines, and hunt them. Details are not developed but probably these allow some kind of fast travel?

# Typology for Introducing D&D Creatures
 
The multiverse, gods, and the story of creation are organized somewhat differently in Taelgar than a standard D&D universe. Still, most, if not all, D&D creatures can fit in somewhere. Here are some guidelines.

1. The [Children of the Divine](<../../species/children-of-the-divine/children-of-the-divine.md>). Many creatures are the spawn of the original children of the Divine -- the great wyrms, titans, elder elementals, and archfey. Any creature with a dragon, fey, elemental, or giant type, or which can be conceptually related to those types, can be a descendant, echo, creation, or perversion of these original children of the divine. The [Kobolds](<../../species/children-of-the-divine/kobolds/kobolds.md>), for example, are the creations of ancient dragons in the days of myth. 
2. The Elder Folk, -- the elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk, and stoneborn -- are the creations of the Embodied Gods, the first gods created by the Divine. These five races have a special place in the world, and have access to racial magic from their connection to the Firstborn. However, any D&D variant of these races could have a place in the world. While drow and duergar are not known in the northwestern portion of Taelgar, the world is wide. The gnomes are a special case, representing a long-sundered lineage of dwarves, and other long-lost “branches'' of the elder races may also exist.
3. The soulless creations. The Divine Presence, Arha and Malik, also created the beasts to populate the world, as did the Firstborn gods of the Elder races. Any beast, and many monstrosities, oozes, and aberrations, can be the descendant, echo, or perversion of these creations. Some of these may be ancient lineages from the days of creation, when magic was strong; others may be more recently arisen. Some plants could also fit into this category.
4. [Children of Belief](<../../species/children-of-belief/children-of-belief.md>). When Arha and Malik created humans, they gave humanity the divine spark, the power of belief. From this belief sprang many gods, and from those gods sprang many wonders, both good and evil. Any fiend or celestial, or any creation of fiends or celestials, such some oozes or plants, as well as gnolls, xvarts, and many monstrosities, could be a creation of one of these gods. With a few exceptions, the key feature of these creations is that they are not native to the material plane.
5. The alien. There are many things flung across the universe that are older, and stranger, than the world of Taelgar. Many aberrations, and especially mind flayers, are ultimately invaders from these Far Realms, and many of these invaders created twisted creations to be their slaves, prey, or entertainment, some of whom still linger in the world. While at the moment, the only canonical invaders to Taelgar are from ancient and disturbing Far Realms, some races and creatures that are traditionally associated with Spelljammer in D&D could have an origin via this mechanism, or via a similar “transport from other timelines” type mechanism.
6. The magical. Some creatures arise from experiments, rituals, strong magic, powerful prayer, or extraordinary events that give consciousness, or at least a will directed for a purpose to creatures or things. Constructs and many undead are from this source, but some aberrations and monstrosities may also be the result of magic gone wrong (or right), as well as plant creatures. 
7. The Children of the Void, including Lycanthropes, [Orcs](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), some Undead, and Goblinoids. Some creatures come from the twisted actions of the Three Despairs, who sought to end the existence that Arha and Malik had brought into being from the energy of the void. Many “main bad guy” humanoids fall into this category, in particular.
8. The awakened. During the elder days, in the Age of Creation and the Days of Myth, when the world was new and the Embodied Gods and the Children of the Divine walked the earth, some creatures were awoken - given minds, and souls, by the powerful magics of the age. The descendents of these awoken creatures can still be found on Taelgar today. Many plant and beast creatures with intelligence and language arose in this way, as did some monstrosities and perhaps a few aberrations or constructs.
9. Unique races. Some races have origin stories that do not neatly fit into any of the categories above. Use this category cautiously! Currently, the three known unique species are the kenku, the centaurs, and the merfolk.

### Decision Tree for Adding New Races
 
1. Is the creature part of a civilization with a history, culture, religious beliefs, language, diversity of thought and opinion? If no, you are likely looking at either 3 or 6, but the choice depends largely on lore and fit. In general, 3 is more low-intelligence “natural” monstrosities and 6 is more high intelligence “cursed” monstrosities, but YMMV. 

2. If the creature does have a civilization with lore, language, etc, is there an obvious fit among the remaining choices? 
	* Dragons, fey, giants, elementals: 1
	* Elder races or variants of Elder races: 2 (but be cautious about introducing variants of Elder races without strong reasons)
	* Extraplanar creatures: 4
	* Related to mind flayers: 5
	* Clearly something that would have been awakened by an existing god: 8


If there is not an obvious choice: is it a major part of a campaign (current or past) that, for plot/story reasons, needs a complex culture and backstory?

If yes, and it is supposed to be an “evil” race, you probably want 7 if it is clearly native to Taelgar, or 5 if it is supposed to be alien and unusual. Although, if it has strong connections to fey, giants, dragons, or elements, 1 is also plausible.

If yes, and it is *not* supposed to be an evil race, consider whether it could have been related to fey, giants, dragons, or elementals, in which case 1. Otherwise, consider 9.

### Key Distinctions of Choices
 
Creatures from 1, while they may worship their creators (e.g. great wyrms, titans, elder elementals, archfey), do not have gods, and should not have clerical magic without unusual circumstances. These creatures, however, may have a soul of sorts and may end up in some extraplanar space when they die.

Creatures from 2, plus humans, are full fledged races with all magic and souls and an afterlife.

Creatures from 4 should not be native to the material plane, and vanish to their native plane when killed. Some creatures from 1 may also share this property, especially archfey and elementals, but in this case the key distinction is their native planes are (typically, but there are exceptions to every rule) echo realms or energy planes, not part of the domain of souls (outer planes in traditional D&D terminology).
 
Creatures from 3 and 6 are distinguished by having no obvious gods or souls or afterlife. Some, such as undead and lycanthropes, may have such a thing from a former existence. Intelligence beast-like creatures that are intended to have souls and possibly worship gods should be 8 or 9, unless there is a clear special case that makes sense for 3. Creatures in 6 are transformations of something else, usually.

Creatures from 5 should also not be native to the material plane, but are not from extraplanar realms, at least not ones created by human beliefs. This can be a pretty generic catch-all category for things that come from elsewhere, don’t have a Taelgar specific story, but are useful/interesting for a plot. Twisted creations of mind flayers and aboleths (in particular) can also go here -- these would usually be corrupted, “evolved” versions of other races, but sometimes could be “brewed from scratch” or brought from “elsewhere.”

Creatures from 7 and 9 are the most complex, and should generally be reserved for things that need a complex and/or evil motivation for a campaign, and don't fit with anything else. 

Creatures from 8 make the most sense as things that have a strong tie to an Elder race / Embodied god, and would often be associated with that race. Can also blend into 1 some, with ‘awakened’ races associated with giants/fey/dragons/elementals. Probably should not have clerical magic, but may have permanent souls associated with the afterlife of the god/Firstborn that woke them up.

See the [Species](<../../species/species.md>) section for how this plays out.

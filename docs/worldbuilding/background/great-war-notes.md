1. The final battle of the Great War was fought with the Sembaran army and the Heroes of the Great War on one side, and Cha'mutte with a hobgoblin army (presumably teleported from Pandar via shadow portals) on the other side, in the passes of the [Sentinel Range](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) at [Urlich Pass](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/urlich-pass.md>).  This ended in Cha'mutte's defeat, and death, along with a Sembaran victory over the hobgoblin forces. 
2. Cha'mutte's armies never seriously threatened southern Sembara; hobgoblins sacked Isingue but did not make it far enough north before the war ended. 
	1. (check notes) these hobgoblin troops were killed when the plague expanded after Cha'mutte's death and killed them, although some survivors attacked Sembara in the years after the Great War ([Timeline of Sembaran History](<../../history/timeline-of-sembaran-history.md>))

From high school campaign but may be retconned: there also was an attack in the north, via the plains north of Vostok, that was perhaps largely stopped at the ancient mystical wall?

**# The Nature of the Divine

Gods in Taelgar are real, and many have an active presence in the world around them, although others are long faded, or unable to influence the world directly for various reasons. However, the metaphysical and magical nature of the Divine is complex. This document summarizes the creation of the world and the gods, the distinctions between various types of gods that exist in Taelgar, and briefly outlines major religions and creation stories of various races, although these are described in more detail in other places. The other planes are described elsewhere, as is the nature of magic in the material plane. 

## The Creation Story

This is the story, told in brief, of the first ages of the world, called the Elder Days, and the origin of the gods.

### The Age of Myth

In the beginning, there was the Void, an endless space that was at once nothing and everything. Into this Void the Divine Beings came into existence. Known as Arha and Malik, representing life and death, creation and destruction, these beings have taken many other names and forms in the annals of myth and legend of the world, and scholars debate their true nature. 

  

As Arha and Malik tore through the fabric of the Void, and shaped its energy into the creation of the material plane and the world of Taelgar, something in the Void awoke that did not want a world to be, sometimes called the Void Mind or the Undivine. This utterly alien mind, if that was the right word for it, could not create, even the smallest pebble, for the act of Creation itself was antithetical to its very existence, but it sought to erase all of Arha and Malik’s work.

  

The first entities to exist in the new world of Taelgar were the children of Arha and Malik. Born from the raw magic of the world and the other planes, these were the great wyrms, the titans, the elder elementals, and the archfey. They spread during the Age of Myth, building great empires with cities towering over the lands, weaving dreamscapes of immense power, and creating echos and reflections of themselves in many forms. Nothing remained still long enough to be named and understood, and the world was ruled by chaos. 

  

So Arha and Malik gave form to the embodied gods, into whom they imbued some of their Divine energy, the raw power of creation and destruction of their Divine Realm. These gods are also known as the Firstborn of the Elder Races: Aldanor and Elmerca, the Living Tree and the Wild Star of the elves; Entamba, the Elder Mountain of the stoneborn; Hazkunde, Bero, Udazkena, and Negu, known as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, the four Tharzen Anzinakoa of the lizardfolk; the Ruler, Runemaster, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, and Farmer, the seven Bahrazel of the dwarves; and Nwana, called the Stranger-Child, Obito, called the Merchant-Musician, and Jemghari, called the Traveler-Storyteller, the two-faced First Ones of the halflings.

  

The Void Mind had been waiting, and watching, and as Arha and Malik shaped the embodied gods and bestowed them with Divine power, the Void Mind stole the breath of the Divine, and out of itself spun the Three Despairs: Umidzka, the Empty; G’Zab, the All Consuming; and Jinnik, the Madness, and through these beings this mind worked in the shadows against the creations of the Divine. It is said that the first act of the Three Despairs was to use their stolen Divine power to embody a god of their own, and out of the union of G’Zab and Umidzka, Thark, the God of War Without End was born. Rumors other creations of the Despairs persist: the Goddess of the End, the Hopeless One, the offspring of G’Zab and Jinnik; the Endless Chaos, the offspring of Umidzka and Jinnik; the Mad One, the embodied avatar of Jinnik. Some have even speculated that the Three Despairs unleashed embodied curses into the world, attributing the curse of undeath and necromancy to Umidzka, and the curse of lycanthropy to Jinnik.

### The Age of Creation

The Age of Myth came to an end as Arha and Malik perceived the world they spawned had become consumed by chaos, with little fixed form and endless change wrought by their divine creations. Drawing on the full strength of their endless Divine power, they sundered the multiverse, ripping the echo realms from the material plane, making the world round and the land fixed in form, and, some say, spawning an endless number of parallel realities.

  

The children of the Divine and the embodied gods fled as magic diminished in Taelgar, retreated to other planes. But into the newly empty lands of Taelgar, the embodied gods created the Elder Races. First, the elves, followed by the stoneborn, the lizardfolk, the dwarves, and finally the halflings. These Elder races quickly grew to dominate the landscape. They walked the land, built great civilizations, created, and lived, and died, their souls going to join their creators. 

  

And yet, Arha and Malik were not finished, and after many centuries created one last thing: the humans. They raised a great land in the ocean to be their homeland, which became known as Hkar. Humans, unlike the Elder races, were gifted the power of the divine spark. With this power, the humans were granted the ability to will into being aspects of the Divine by their belief alone. As humans spread across Hkar, and eventually beyond, aware of the divine presence in everything but without the names of gods to worship -- for Arha and Malik did not answer their prayers or manifest themselves in the world for humans to see -- the first human religions began to take shape, and the first Incorporeal Gods came into being. 

  

In secret, though, through the long years the Void Mind and the Three Despairs were still at work. The Void Mind, picking at torn edges of the multiverse, allowed alien horrors from Far Realms to leak through. Through Thark, the orcs were born, slaves to the compulsion of their creator to seek nothing but war and violence. And finally, the Three Despairs breathed life into life a new race, the hobgoblins, a race of people that would have no god, that would see no Divine, that would forsake the divine spark of humans.

  

The Elder Days ended in conflagration, as a great war broke out between the Elder races and these evils unleashed into the world, In these battles, the land of Hkar was destroyed, and the world changed, as the Elder races withdrew from prominence and the age of humans began.

## The Gods of Taelgar

The elves recount many types of divine and near-divine powers, some known well to them, others distant tales of myth and legend. These are recounted here, roughly in order from the strongest, most powerful beings, to the weakest.

### The High Gods

Arha and Malik, the duality, the Divine Presence, the aspects of birth/growth/creation and death/decline/destruction, are acknowledged as the supreme gods in the multiverse, the over-gods, the source of nearly all else. These beings do not depend on belief for their existence, and in recordings of elven loremasters are always perceived as distant over-gods, despite cults of worship around Arha, Malik, or both existing at various times and places in the history of Taelgar.

  

The Void Mind, alien and not understood, without power, without any ability to reach the material world, is also a high god of a kind, also distant and uncaring of prayer and belief, but dedicated to emptiness, to undoing the creation of the multiverse and all of Arha and Malik’s work. Whether cults of worship to the Void exist is not recorded in lore. 

  

Beyond the multiverse, in the Far Realms of alien horror, rumors of Great Old Ones persist, ancient eldritch masters with utterly alien minds, reaching into the world through the holes in the fabric of reality worn by the Void from the sundering of the planes.

  

Not quite gods, but powerful in their own right are the Three Despairs: Umidzka, the Empty; G’Zab, the All Consuming; and Jinnik, the Madness. Summoned into existence by the Void Mind, they are unable to create or use magic, but are always looking to influence the actions of others towards destruction and nihilism.

### The Embodied Gods

The direct creations of the Divine, the embodied gods were given physical form by the High Gods, given permanence and consciousness, and the Divine power to create. Not dependent upon belief for their power, the embodied gods created people in their image.

  

The Firstborn, created by Arha and Malik, gave rise to the Elder races: Aldanor and Elmerca, the Living Tree and the Wild Star of the elves; Entamba, the Elder Mountain of the stoneborn; Hazkunde, Bero, Udazkena, and Negu, known as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, the four Tharzen Anzinakoa of the lizardfolk; the Ruler, Runemaster, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, and Farmer, the seven Bahrazel of the dwarves; and Nwana, called the Stranger-Child, Obito, called the Merchant-Musician, and Jemghari, called the Traveler-Storyteller, the two-faced First Ones of the halflings.

  

Thark, the God of War Without End, created by the union of Umidzka and G’Zab, gave rise to the orcs, and through his compulsion drives them to violence for the sake of violence, although rumors persist of orcs who have thrown off the curse of their god. Elven lore records rumors of other embodied gods spawned by the Three Despairs, including Ghesyn, the Goddess of the End, also known as the Hopeless One, the offspring of G’Zab and Jinnik; the Endless Chaos, the offspring of Umidzka and Jinnik; the Mad One, the embodied avatar of Jinnik.

### The Incorporeal Gods

After Arha and Malik created humans, many gods came into being through the power of belief and the divine spark of humanity. These gods are sustained by the belief of their human worshippers. While they can be very powerful, and have the strength to act in the world itself, their power in Taelgar waxes and wanes with the strength of their worshippers’ belief. 

  

Over the long years of human history, many incorporeal gods have been imagined into being. The early primordial gods of Hkar are many, and most have long faded into silence or oblivion. The most important ones that still retain some lingering power in Taelgar include the demon lords of curses, of chaotic rage and fear, in their home, the Abyss; the archdevils, the manifestation of the worst evils of the human heart, in their home, the Nine Hells; the Earth Mother, the embodiment of the worship of the world itself and the strength and power of nature, in her domain Arborea; and the archangels, the manifestation of the best virtues of humanity, in their home, Celestia. Few of these early primordial gods have organized worshippers in Taelgar in the modern day, and their power to act in the world is much diminished. But these are ancient gods, the oldest of the incorporeal gods, and over the long years they have learned many tricks and secrets to reach into the world. And even now, they can still harvest the divine spark of the inchoate prayers and fears and hopes and nightmares of humanity, to keep their realms from fading to nothing. 

  

As Hkar grew in power, the Mos Numena, usually called the Divine Way or just the Way, was established, worshiping the Eight Divines. This set of worship practices became the dominant in Hkar as well as all the descendant civilizations of that great power, starting with Drankor, and down to the modern civilizations that grew or were influenced by that great empire. The Way focuses worship on the Eight Divines, eight incorporeal gods known as: the Mother, the Father, the Night Queen, the Warlord, the Sibyl, the Wanderer, the Wyrdling, and the Wilding. These gods, old and grown strong with widespread and numerous followers, are among the most powerful of the incorporeal gods.

  

Many humans, however, had left Hkar before the fall, settling across the known world in the shadow of the Elder races. These settlers developed their own beliefs and sets of worship practice, as they spread across the land, and some survived through the Downfall of Hkar, the spread of Drankor, the First Plague, and the Great War. Most prominent in northwestern Taelgar is the Dunmari tradition, worshipping the Holy Family, the siblings Jeevali, Aagir, Chidya, Sonkar, and Laka. But other incorporeal gods linger as well, including the Kestavo of Vostok and the Sembaran highlands, Kaikkea, the ocean god of the Skaer people, and the scattered folk religions of the remnants of the Northlanders who survived the Great War. In the distant lands to the east and south, rumors of other gods persist. 

### Demigods

The divine spark that gives the incorporeal gods life and power is a living thing, and the incorporeal gods can, in times of need, gift some of this power to another, imbuing a powerful creature with some measure of divinity. Although doing so diminishes the giving god, as they give away some of their power, if in turn such an act inspires more belief, they heal and grow stronger through the growing strength of their worshippers. And the receiving creature gains some measure of strength, and becomes a demigod. 

  

Some demigods attract belief, and grow in power, and become the focus of worship themselves, raising themselves to full godhood. Some even overthrow their divine creators, and become in the eyes of their followers the true divinity. Others, however, never attract divine belief, and so never grow beyond the strength originally imbued in them by their creators. 

  

A number of demigods dot the landscape of Taelgar. Some, like Shakun and Bhishma of the Dunmari pantheon, are minor gods in the story of larger religions. Others, like Beryl the Hunter, are heroes gifted the status of the divine in rewards for their great deeds. Still others have origins that remain shrouded in mystery, such as Vorshitaal, the god of the kenku. 

  

Theologians and scholars debate whether the embodied gods, like the incorporeal gods, can imbue some of their divine power into powerful creatures, creating lesser gods. Without a way to regain their strength, some say this is impossible, as the embodied gods would be permanently diminished. Others, however, argue the embodied gods are old, and in the Age of Creation when they walked the earth, many things were possible that now are not.

### Faded Gods

While the power of the incorporeal gods to act in Taelgar depends on the strength of their divine spark, which depends on the belief of their human worshippers, gods, once arisen, do not so easily die, even when belief in them fades and they are forgotten.

  

Instead, these forgotten gods lose their divine power, their ability to shape raw divine magic and make it manifest in the world of Taelgar. But rumors and myths persist of forgotten gods, entombed in their faded divine realms, drifting through the astral plane and the Plane of Souls, perhaps to awaken again.  

### The Children of the Divine

In the earliest days of creation, Arha and Malik birthed four types of beings with great power: the great wyrms, the titans, the elder elementals, and the archfey.

  

While these beings are not divine, and have no access to raw divine magic, these powerful beings were infused with great magic, and while the energy of creation was still raw, were able to create many beings in their image. Now, many of these great beings are worshipped as gods themselves, especially among the many creations of their making, but also sometimes among humans and even the elder races. 

  

Many of the most powerful of these entities are among the oldest living minds in the multiverse, older even than the embodied gods, and what great secrets of magic and mystery they may have uncovered, even the wisest elven sages cannot say.

## Souls and the Afterlife

When a consciousness, or soul, dies, it fades from the Plane of Souls, but does not immediately disappear into nothingness. Most (although not all) instead drift towards the Land of the Dead, which has many names and many descriptions in different cultures, human and non-human alike. Here, the souls of the dead drift, waiting. Some, those who are not claimed by any god or being of similar power, eventually fade away into nothingness, becoming part of the essence of the place itself. Others are taken up into spiritual realms.

  

In human cultures, an old idea dating to soon after the creation of humanity persists, that each human is always granted two miracles: the miracle at birth, when the soul enters the world, and the miracle at death, when the soul is taken up by the Divine. The miracle of birth is invisible, but the miracle of death is the focus of many different funeral practices. 

  

All souls make two transitions: first, from the plane of consciousness to the Land of the Dead within the first few minutes after death, and second from the Land of the Dead to its final resting place, usually about 10 days after death. Many funeral and burial practices of human religious cultures are organized around easing and facilitating these two transitions, although the specifics vary considerably across cultures.

  

All Divinities are granted the power to deliver the miracle of death, by way of giving a sign to their worshippers that the soul of the dead has been taken up. This sign comes in different ways and at different times for different gods. For example, in the Dunmari tradition, the journey is seen as a test of the soul, and the miracle of death is granted at the conclusion of the journey, when the soul reaches the Afterlife, while in the tradition of Mos Numena, the miracle is granted soon after death, a sign that the door to the divine realm is open to the traveling soul.

## Worship Practices and Pantheons

Many diverse ways to worship the gods across the landscape of Taelgar, associated with different cultures and major pantheons. 

### Worship of the Embodied Gods

The Embodied Gods are the Firstborn of the Elder Races, and are typically worshipped by those races exclusively or nearly so. Details to follow...

### Worship of the Incorporeal Gods

The Incorporeal Gods gain power and influence in the world of Taelgar through the strength of their worship. Nonetheless, few question the existence of the major pantheons in Taelgar, and articles of faith or affirmations of conversion are not expected or part of most practices of worship in Taelgar. Instead, what is called religion is more like a set of traditional symbols, rituals, prayers, and feast days. The older a tradition, and the more widely practiced it is, the more power its continued observance has in the Divine realm. So new gods often struggle to be born, and ancient gods linger as long as a few followers keep to the old ways. Many traditions and rituals are thus focused on venerating and remembering miracles of the Divine, as great expenditures of Divine power can be returned many times over in repeated feasts, holidays, and ceremonies. 

  

Importantly, practices of worship, religion, and ceremony are distinct from the gods themselves. While a follower of a particular religious tradition may not venerate deities outside the associated pantheon via a shared set of rituals and practices, this does not have any relevance on their specific relationship to one of the gods of these outside pantheons. Indeed, even the Elder races are known to occasionally have personal relationships with particular incorporeal gods that exist outside the worship traditions of their race and culture. 

  

In some cases, the connection between worship and divine strength leads to conquerors attempting to violently suppress all worship of prior gods, in an attempt to deprive disfavored deities of power. Whether, ultimately, this is possible, or whether gods cling to power as long as they are acknowledged, is not known with any certainty. Nonetheless, the reality and continued existence of some old gods has been questioned, and sometimes miracles attributed to gods are claimed to be tricks of sorcerers or fiends. 

####  A Brief History of Human Religions

Human religions began when humanity was created by Arha and Malik in Hkar. The early days of humanity were a time of rich belief, as everything was tinged with the afterglow of the Divine, the people and the land of Hkar having newly sprung from the essence of Ahra and Malik. Still echoing with the Divine magic of their creation, the divine spark, the essence of humanity that empowers their belief to bring Incorporeal Gods into being, was particularly strong. 

  

In the first generations after the Creation, the humans prayed to their creators, but received no answers. In the face of this silence, the idea of intercession developed, the realization that Ahra and Malik will not answer directly, and will only speak through intermediaries. These first humans turned to the world around them, praying to abstract forces of nature and divinity. The prayers and curses of the earliest humans to the divine forces created the primordial gods -- the first intercessory gods, given life on the extraplanar realms of Celestia, Arborea, the Abyss, and the Nine Hells, in order to bring the prayers, curses, fears, and hopes of humanity back to the Divine Presence. 

  

As this religious tradition evolved, the first wave of human emigration from Hkar spread east and north; these people brought with them the Northern Folk Religions, a collected set of beliefs centered on the idea of intercession. These traditions, carried throughout the northwest of Taelgar by the first human explorers, are some of the most ancient religious traditions in Taelgar. The Northern Folk Religions are based on the idea of intercession with Arha and Malik, but with the belief that the best agents to intercede are small and local and familiar. The spirits of places, and of animals or other beasts are seen as particularly important, and although some of these spirits gain names and wider followings, for the most part the divine is seen as a series of small local shrines to this tree or this rock or this stream. Later scholars and historians speculate these early beliefs were likely influenced by the magical nature of the land they spread across, inhabited by the fey, elves, and other magical beings that may have helped or hindered these early human explorers. 

  

As these human pioneers were spreading across the northwest, a new tradition was developing on Hkar. The earliest primordial gods gave way to pantheons, sets of powerful Incorporeal Gods with distinct personalities and the power to control much of the world directly. These gods were typically seen as the children of Ahra and Malik, or the creations of them, but as the stories are told of these gods, and their power grows, the idea of intercession begins to recede. These new gods, flush with power from their human believers, no longer need to channel the Divine Presence, and they create miracles and grant prayers with a breath and a song.

  

Elven scholars and theologians have debated for centuries the nature of the divine spark gifted to humanity, and how these powerful Incorporeal gods were able to arise from belief alone. But despite long centuries of thought and debate, knowledge of the birth of incorporeal gods remains the ineffable mystery of Ahra and Malik. No one can say for sure how new gods are born, or how old gods fade away, and exactly how the essence of humanity generates the divine magic in the world. 

  

In this time of flux, a new wave of human migrations left Hkar, to the south. What religious beliefs these people held, and whether they brought with them the intercessory traditions of the earliest humans, the emerging pantheonic tradition, or some other as of yet unmentioned tradition, is not recorded by the sages.

  

Over the next millenia, life on Hkar continued, but some small groups of humans begin to leave, to found new homes for themselves on the mainland. Many of these minor exoduses from Hkar left no descendants to the current day, as their cultures and people were lost to chance and time. But some survived, the most important of which for scholars of the current age are the Dunmari, a small group of emigrants who worshipped a close-knit pantheon of gods, the five Divine Siblings, the children of Ahra and Malik. 

  

By the time twelve hundred years had passed since the creation, most of those remaining on Hkar, especially in the densely settled and urbanized eastern half of the continent, worshipped a group of eight Incorporeal Gods, the Eight Divines. The main exception was an important mariner culture, largely on the far western coast of Hkar, who worshipped their own pantheon of gods. These ancient mariners journeyed far and wide across the Endless Ocean, eventually reaching the eastern shores of the Green Sea, where they settled and began to spread. During their journey, a new religion was founded, <ArhaMeditation>, that emphasized meditation and direct prayer to Arha and Malik themselves. However, not all forsook the old gods, and those who held to their traditional pantheonic religion sailed far to the west of the Green Sea. 

  

As this remnant of the mariners spread into the western Green Sea, some settled on the Skaer islands. Over the long years, the Skaer traditions empowered the <OceanGod>, and gradually, the rest of the mariner pantheon was forgotten. From here came the <SkaerReligion>, still practiced among the Skaer islands. Others settled on the coastlines around the Western Gulf, and as their villages moved up the great river valleys of the region, they met the Northerners, their long sundered brethren. The northern folk traditions mixed with pantheonic ideas of the mariners, and a new religion was born, worshipping the local spirits called the Kestavo. 

  

In Hkar, a firm culture of worship, Mos Numera, developed around the Eight Divines, now the predominant gods of Hkar. In the downfall, it is only through the actions of the Eight Divines that humanity was saved, and when the Drankorians established their empire, Mos Numera was the religion that dominated, spreading everywhere the Drankorians had influence.

  

In the Western Gulf of the Green Sea, the Kestavo tradition was largely replaced by Mos Numera, except in the far highlands, and the north of Vostok. But the influences of the Kestavo traditions were significant, and so the practices of worship in Sembara and its surroundings were different in some ways from that of the rest of the Drankorian Empire.

  

Since the fall of Drankor the human religions have changed little. The gods, powerful and secure in their identities and might, inspire miracles and belief, and so, they change little.

  

In the current day, there are several broad strands of religious thought, with some regional variations:

- Mos Numena, the tradition of the Eight Divines, with a distinct eastern (Sembaran) and western (traditional) branches, but who all worship the same gods.
    
- The Divine Family of the Dunmari Tradition, which has remained pretty steady over time, albeit still with some small differences in practice in the western (current day Dunmar) and eastern (Green Sea coast “eastern Dunmar”) traditions.
    
- The Old Gods, the Kestavo, the religion of the ancient Western Gulf, a blend of the now-faded old mariner pantheon and the northern folk religions
    
- <OceanGod> of Skagenland, a remnant of unique tradition born in the Endless Ocean during the time of Hkar
    
- The Northern Folk Religions, a highly varied set of traditions focused on spirit worship and intercession, spread throughout the northwest of Taelgar
    
- The <AhraMalikMeditation>, a mysterious tradition in the far East, with a belief in the primacy of Ahra and Malik
    
- The unknown religions of the south, and possible other pantheonic religions from the period of migration that brought the proto-Dunmari to the mainland. 
    
- The <DesertReligion>, which is a unique blend of the proto-Dunmar, “Old Eastern”, and “Southern” religions
    

#### Mos Numena

Mos Numena refers to the traditions of worship associated with the Eight Divines: the Mother, the Father, the Warlord, the Night Queen, the Sibyl, the Wanderer, the Wyrding, and the Wildling. These are the eight gods originally worshipped by many humans of Hkar, and later the major religion of the Drankorian empire. Now, these gods are the dominant religion across much of the west coast, centered on the Chardonian Empire, and the western Green Sea, including Sembara, Vostok, and Cymea, as well as other places where the Drankorian Empire held sway, or cultural influence. More information on these gods and the traditions associated with them can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-kMpFwnnbr4b4Huwe-SOOO-R4ziDosNcvf7c7qBKQ0/edit).

#### Dunmari Tradition

The Dummari worship their own gods, the Divine Family, the Holy Paktrene, the five divine siblings, the children of Ahra and Malik: Jeevali, Chidya, Aegir, Sonkar, and Laka. These gods were originally worshipped by many of the people who left Hkar before the fall and settled on the central coasts and the arid steppes on the western edge of the great deserts. Now, these gods are worshipped by the Dunmari, as well as <unnamed country south of Cymea that was also settled by Dunmari>, and some scattered remnants of these people still living between the great desert and the Sea of Storms. More information on these gods and the traditions associated with them can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kpdwpKjGZjRUINiLPbEn4-2GMUTxPVmYsefuS9gVhW0/edit).**

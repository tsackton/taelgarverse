## ChatGPT estimate for Ikram's rebuilding

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 weeks)

- **Site Preparation:** Clearing the existing debris and preparing the site for reconstruction (1-2 weeks).

### Phase 2: Structural Work (3-4 months)

- **Foundation Strengthening:** If necessary, reinforcing the foundation (1-2 weeks).
- **Wall Reconstruction:** Rebuilding the walls with adobe bricks, which includes laying the bricks and allowing them to dry (2-3 months).

### Phase 3: Roofing (1-2 months)

- **Roof Frame Construction:** Building the wooden frames for the roof (2-4 weeks).
- **Roofing with Tiles:** Placing adobe tiles on the roof, allowing for weather conditions (2-4 weeks).

### Phase 4: Interior and Finishing (1-2 months)

- **Interior Walls and Flooring:** Constructing any interior walls and laying down the flooring (3-4 weeks).
- **Utilities and Functional Spaces:** Establishing common areas, storage, stables, and water sources (2-4 weeks).

### Phase 5: Final Touches (1 month)

### Overall Estimated Time: 6-9 months

Assumed Ikram's could be rebuilt in roughly 7 months (started in June, finished in January). Basically, assume the shorter end of the timeline, but also add a bit of time for monsoon-related delays.

It makes heavy use of the [Köppen Climate Classification](https://www.mindat.org/climate.php)

Some classifications of common places:

* Insingue - Cwa/BSk
* Sembara - Dwa to Dwb in highlands
* Cymea - Dfa to Cfa in south
* Tyrwingha - Dfa
* "Eastern Dunmari Peninsula" - Cwa bit of Aw/As

Reminders about climate types:

* Cwa and Cfa are both sub-tropical - think Southeastern US, where Cfa is more rainfall year round.

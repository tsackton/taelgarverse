**Rough Notes, and drawing on demographics from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rMp9eP617CMDdkDgmDRPpOOUbO0TjTY17578DK2wPwo/edit#gid=1269516051).

  

Age of Hkar:

  

- Population starts with about a million people on Hkar, who grow for about 15-20 generations (assuming 30 years or a bit under for a generation time, which seems consistent with genetic evidence in humans), the population roughly doubling in this time
    
- Migrations start, as people begin to leave Hkar
    

- Slowly at first, with a few people leaving for the closest coast (what is now western Dunmar, I guess), and migrating up the western side of the ~CentralMountains~, staying fairly coastal and settling islands. These become the ~West Northlanders~.
    
- Another, larger burst of people head south, and settle on closest south coast, becoming the currently undeveloped ~Southerners~
    

- A pause for another 15-20 generations, and then another round of migrations, traveling further by sea
    

- The first trickle settles on the fertile plains that will become the great desert (current thinking is that the gradual, or perhaps sudden, desertification of the great plains during/after the Drankorian empire pushes the Dunmari north), these are the ~Central~ people, ethnically the predecessors of the Dunmari
    
- The final, rather bigger wave heads north and east and begins to settle around the Green Sea (these are ~East Northlanders~
    

- The Downfall: wars erupt, Hkar sinks. Many Hkarans die, many of the Elder races die, slightly fewer of the humans on the mainland die. Most of survivors of Hkar land around Drankor, but some flee to other continents.
    

  

At the end of the Age of Hkar, have maybe 10 million people in the world, largely in the west north, the south, and at Drankor, with small but growing populations around the Green Sea and the central plains.

  

Age of Drankor:

  

- Drankor expands: 
    

- First to present-day Dunmar and points due east of the main river (which is largely depopulated as was previously mostly settled by Elder races)
    
- Second to Green Sea: first ~South Cymea~ and ~Irebor~, then Cymea, then Sembara last.
    
- Third to West Coast: first Chardon coastal plains, then islands/peninsula, then inland forests to the mountains.
    

- East northlanders expand around the Green Sea, mostly in a relatively narrow coastal strip on the north coast, but also settling some islands and some, especially those fleeing Drankor’s influence, settle far north
    
- West northlanders that don’t die during Drankorian conquests largely pushed towards islands
    
- Central population begins to move north as plains dry up
    
- South??
    
- The Plague: hits central Drankor and area around hardest, where millions die, but in outer provinces more of a political shock than a major mortality event.
    

  

Age of Cha’mutte:

  

- Plains of Drankor are largely empty, and are conquered by Dunmari fleeing from the south
    
- West coast fractures, with Chardon retaining Drankorian ideals and styling itself a success, first to Drankor the city then to Drankor the empire, while further north small kingdoms of mixed Drankorian and West Northlander heritage grow from wreckage
    
- Green Sea more stable, polities grow out of Drankorian provinces in many cases
    
- East Northlander civs to east and on islands fairly stable
    
- The Great War: hits the west coast north of Chardon and the Dunmari hardest, where 50% of population dies in Great War and subsequent chaos; Sembara less affected, but ~Irebor~ wiped out
    

  
  

  

### A Brief History Of Humanity in Taelgar

Humanity is created on Hkar by Arha and Malik, and the first several hundred years grows and spreads over the homeland created for them, the land of Hkar.

  

This is a time of rich belief. In the first, early days of Creation, everything is tinged with the afterglow of the Divine, the people and the land of Hkar having newly sprung from the essence of Ahra and Malik. Still echoing with the Divine magic of their creation, the divine spark, the essence of humanity that empowers their belief to bring Incorporeal Gods into being, is particularly strong. During these first 500 years of human existence, a few notable developments occur:

  

- The basic idea of intercession develops. Driven by the very earliest generations, who experienced the creation and knew the reality of Arha and Malik, but could not get them to listen to their prayers
    
- A set of primordial fears and hopes and beliefs emerges into the four extraplanar realms: Celestia, the Abyss, the Nine Hells, and Arborea. 
    
- These two developments are deeply related. So the first primordial gods -- the rulers of Celestia, Arborea, the Abyss, and the Nine Hells -- are also the first intercessory gods, the first Divine beings the humans ask to help them, to keep them safe, by bringing prayers, curses and requests back to their Creators, Ahra and Malik.
    
- Some people, driven by the innate curiosity of humanity, begin to explore the ocean, and discover the mainland continent, the home of the Elder races. 
    

  

After 500 years or so, the first mass migration leaves Hkar. Even the elven scholars who witnessed these first migrations are no longer sure of what drove people to leave their homeland: what is an attraction and desire to interact with other races, a desire for space and open land, or some kind of cultural split on Hkar itself? 

  

In any case, these first migrants, later called the ~Northerners~, first land on the shores of the great elven kingdoms of ~EK~, in what is now western Dunmar, and begin to settle along the coast, moving north into unsettled land. At this time, the main continent is the domain of the great empires of the Elder Races. While the borders, culture, and distribution of these empires is not recorded in human lore, all scholars agree that, at this time, before the Downfall of Hkar, human migrants to the main continent were living in small, scattered communities, in the shadow of the Elder races. There are no great human empires from these times, and few substantial cities, with most of human culture and society developing in the fringes of the world, on islands and unsettled coasts and other places in the gaps of the great Elder race civilizations. 

  

These people, the ~Northerners~, leave before any true unified religion coalesces out of the primordial beliefs on Hkar, but long after the idea of intercession developed. They spread originally from the Nevos Sea coasts north along the western coast of the main continent, and eventually move somewhat inland in the farther north, until they encounter the central mountains.

  

Living in small villages and family groups, often in the shadow and protection of elves or lizardfolk, one of the ~Northerners~ most lasting contributions to the modern day is their religious traditions. Northern religion is based on the idea of intercession, but with the belief that the best agents to intercede are small and local and familiar. The spirits of places, and of animals or other beasts are seen as particularly important, and although some of these spirits gain names and wider followings, for the most part the divine is seen as a series of small local shrines to this tree or this rock or this stream. Later scholars and historians speculate these early beliefs were likely influenced by the magical nature of the land they spread across, inhabited by the fey, elves, and other magical beings that may have helped or hindered these early human explorers. 

  

Over the next thousand or more years, this culture spreads northward along the coast into the cold lands of the Far North, and then east to cold plains of ~KenkuHomeland~ and into a number of scattered communities in what is now the highlands of Vostok. But they don’t spread east of the ~Vostok Mountains~ and they never spread into the lowlands along the coast of the Green Sea. During their spread, the idea of the cultural hero / king as an additional intercessory agent develops, and the more modern form of the religion includes a number of Cultural Hero type ancestor spirits who have acquired divine status -- but the religious traditions of the Northerners are diverse and the exact nature of these guardian spirits has some regional variations.

  

Within a few generations of the Northerners leaving, another mass migration leaves Hkar. These are the Southerners and they spread along the coastlines to the south and east of Hkar, moving inland over generations across the main equatorial regions of the continent. Little is recorded of these people in the records of scholars of the current age, as after the Fall of Hkar, the hazardous sea journey south through the Sea of Storms, and the expanse of the Great Desert, limited contact between the northern and the southern parts of the world. Still, many have speculated that when the land was sundered during the Fall, splitting the continents in two, these people were torn asunder as well, with some people settling in the tropical coasts and near inland in the south of the northern continent, and others settling in the southern continent. If, as Elven scholars speculate, any Hkarans escaped the Fall to the south, it seems likely that this far southern culture, on the new southern continent, mingled with those survivors. 

  

At this time (around ~650 years after humanity was created) a new religious tradition starts to emerge: a pantheonic tradition that starts to focus around a set of named divinities as more important than the increasingly distant overgods. This worship tradition grows increasingly important in the history of Hkar over the next millenia, as these named Divinities grow in power as they accumulate belief.

During the next 500 years, a group of seafarers begins to increasingly push the boundaries of the scope of the world known to humanity. While many explore the known coasts to the east of Hkar, where the Northerners and Southerners have already settled in the shadow of the Elder races, some begin to sail west into the Endless Ocean. These explorers discover the eastern part of the main continent and the Green Sea, a land of few Elder races, and no people. 

  

So, around 1200 years after humanity was created, two waves of migration leave Hkar, at nearly the same time as each other. 

  

- One group, a group of pantheonic Hkarans (but who predate the establishment of the Eight Divines), sails east and spreads across the plains southeast of the great elven forests. These are the ancestors of the Dunmari, and they brought with them a new religion of the Divine Siblings. 
    
- The second group, the aforementioned seafaring intercessory Hkarans, although now somewhat influenced by the pantheonic concepts, sails west, and begins to settle the empty lands around the eastern end of the Green Sea. These people the Easterners (Green Sea people / east northerners). They have an intercessory religious tradition, but very different from the northerners in that it has a much more defined hierarchy and set of divine entities. This is likely the bulk of the intercessory Hkarans, and after this migration Hkar develops more firmly toward the Eight Divines religion
    


So in the time just before the downfall of Hkar, there are five main groups of humanity:


  

- On Hkar, a relatively unified culture, with an urban, magical orientation and little seafaring, worshipping the Eight Divines. This is the vast majority of humanity still.
    
- On the main continent, spread along the tropical western coast and the equatorial interior, a ‘southern’ culture, the second largest group of humanity.
    
- On the main continent, spread along the temperate west coast, and the central interior and far north, a ‘northern’ culture, with a unique religion based around many small intercessory spirits and semi-divine great heroes. Living almost entirely in the shadow of the Elder race empires, except perhaps on some islands in the Endless Ocean west of the coast. These people are about as numerous as the Easterners but less numerous than the southerners. 
    
- Around the eastern Green Sea, an ‘eastern’ culture, with a significant seafarer element to their culture. These people, settling in empty land, have a more urban culture than the northerners, and small kingdoms and other political units have developed. They are just about as numerous as the northerners. 
    

- The eastern culture has two strands, based on a religious split. One strand, the “neo-easterners”, are followers of a new philosophical-religious tradition, which holds that through meditation and practice humanity can access the divine spark directly. The other strand, the “old eastenders”, follow the traditional mariner pantheon of their culture on Hkar.
    

- Across the central plains of the main continent, the proto-Dunmari, with their own unique language and pantheonic religion. They are the smallest group of humanity by a significant margin.
    

  

In a few places, even before the downfall, these cultures would be mixing:

- In the highlands of Sembara and Vostok and the Far North, on the eastern slopes and highlands of the ~CentralMountains~,  the ‘northern’ and ‘eastern’ cultures have encountered each other, and a blended ‘eastern northern’ culture has arisen, with its own religious tradition.
    
- On the central plains of the main continent (not yet desert), a bit of a melting pot culture with elements of the easterners, southerners, and proto-Dunmari exists, but this region has a very low population density.
    
- Similarly, on the east coast, the Easterners and Southerns are meeting and blending a bit.
    

  

The downfall of Hkar is a massive disaster. A continent sized place sinks, and the main continent is sundered into a north and south half. Among other changes, this disaster dries the central plains, which become a great desert, and creates the Sea of Storms, a magically cursed area where navigation is difficult, extending east and north from where the continent of Hkar sank. When the wreckage clears after a generation or two, the following cultures exist:

  

- Hkar is gone, but the bulk of the survivors have established Drankor which is spreading to the north and west into the fertile and empty lands that were formerly occupied by great Elder race empires. 
    
- The southern culture has been devastated by the sundering of the north and south continents, and has splintered into three groups
    

- The ‘south continent’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which emerged on the southern continent and merged with Hkaran refugees
    
- The ‘south islander’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which rebuilt a culture in the newly formed seas, bays, and islands along the (new) south coast, as well as the western coast along the Sea of Storms, south of the desert.
    
- The ‘south mainland’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which forms in the interior of the southern part of the north continent; these cultures have some eastern influences on the east coast.
    

- The northern and eastern cultures largely survive intact
    
- The proto-Dunmari largely settle on the arid fringes of the great desert, stretching mostly along the north edge of the desert in the savannas and grasslands there.
    
- A new, unique desert culture emerges, with some proto-Dunmari, some southern, and some eastern influence, as well as a strong influence of the gnomes, who shelter these people during the worst of the Downfall years.
    

  

Over the next five hundred years, Drankor expands through the northwest, first through the land that is now Dunmar and up the ~RiverValley~, then into the western Green Sea, and then along the western Endless Ocean coast. To the east, they expand along the north coast of the Sea of Storms and the ~GreatBay~, and inland to the ~GreenSeaMountains~. 

  

The expansion of Dunmar slows and stops for a variety of political, economic, and magical reasons in the time period between 4600-4800. The borders solidify along the along the Volta river and the Green Sea coast in the northeast; in a rough line extending from the northern point of ~ChardonCoast~ to the split between the branches of the ~LakeRiver~ to the edge of the ~GreatForest~ in the northwest, to the ~GreenSeaMountains~ in the east, and to ~TerrainAsYetUndetermined~ in the southeast, north of the desert and west of the main territory of the Dunmari. 

  

During the time of the Drankorian Empire, the other human cultures are not static:

  

- Although many Northerners end up living in Drankorian provinces, or in small kingdoms heavily influenced by Drankorian culture, some resist or flee Drankorian expansion. 
    

- The conquered Northerners, mostly in the south (south of the big lake), are largely forcibly assimilated; their gods are hunted and driven extinct, and the people who won’t convert or submit are largely exiled.
    
- The assimilated Northerners, further north in the lands north of the lake but south and inland of the ~NorthernBay~, develop a culture with a mix of Drankorian and Northern elements. In most of this region, the worship of the Eight Divines displaces pre-existing religions. 
    
- The exiled Northerners form two major branches, who retain their ancestral religious traditions.
    

- Many of those that fled Drankorian rule fled west to the islands, which is already one of the more urbanized population centers of the northern culture
    
- Others fled north into the marginal lands along the Northern Bay and further north. 
    

- The ‘east northerner’ culture of the western Green Sea is almost entirely assimilated into Drankor, with only some remnants in the highlands and in particular in the highlands of Vostok.


    
- The ‘eastern’ culture, like the Northerners, ends up diverging based on the influence of Drankor
    

- In the islands and the north coast of the green sea, the people are trading and interacting with the Drankorian empire but never significantly under threat of conquest. These people develop into the ~NorthCoast~, ~Skaer~, and ~GreenSeaIsland~ cultures, and especially in the far east and north retain the original eastern cultures.
    
- Along the south coast of the green sea, stretching from ~South Cymea~ as far east as the eastern mountains, the influence of Drankor is much greater, and a blended “Drankor/eastern” culture develops. In most of this region, like the assimilated northerners, the worship of the Eight Divines displaces pre-existing religions. 
    

- The proto-Dunmari, a small and relatively isolated/culturally unique group, are of course aware of the existence of a great empire to the west, but remain aloof to its cultural influence.
    
- The southern islanders, while never under threat of conquest by Drankor, are a significant trading partner, as coastal trade along the Sea of Storms provides a route for goods to flow from the south, around the desert, and to Drankor itself. 
    
- The ‘mainland’ southern culture, south and east of the desert, remains far distant from Drankor itself, but the east coast, in particular, has a bit of a “Europe” relationship with Drankor’s “China”, as long distance trade flows along the south coast of the Green Sea from the urbanized empires of the east to the heartland of the Drankorian Empire. 
    
- The south continent cultures are left undeveloped but totally outside the Drankorian sphere of influence
    

  

Then, Drankor falls, and the first plague devastates the central core of the Drankorian Empire, and causes much political turmoil across the empire. While the geographic changes associated with this plague are not nearly as great as those associated with the downfall of Hkar or the death of Cha’mutte, some significant impacts develop. First, the area around the mouth of the ~DrankorRiver~ is cursed and haunted, and the Sea of Storms intensifies, making the coastal route south difficult/impossible for regular trade, and isolating the south coastal people. Second, shifts in winds and rain and currents promote desertification on the northern edge of the great desert, driving the Dunmari north and west.

  

In the 500 years between the fall of Drankor and the Great War, the following developments occur:

  

- In the west:
    

- Chardon grows as a city state with significant influence over the hinterlands of the former empire. Some small tributary kingdoms and other city-states grow up, but this region (the mainland around Chardon, excluding the Nevos Bay islands and the peninsula) is very Drankorian in culture.
    
- Many small independent kingdoms develop between the northern edge of Chardon’s influence and the far north. Many of the more southern of these kingdoms are strongly Drankorian in culture, but towards the north some have more northlander influences.
    
- In the Far North, Cha’mutte’s base in Pandar grows and begins to exert influence over the more purely northern inland cultures.
    
- The islands and coastal cultures remain
    

- In the Green Sea
    

- Development of Sembara, Vostok, Cymea, etc; plus ~Irebor~ and ~South Cymea~ with a more Drankorian (Cymea-like) culture
    

- Dumari migration
    

- Dunmari migrate northwest, conquering and settling the Drankorian plains
    
- Also some move more north and east, and settle/conquer/assimilate/blend with the “non-Drankorian, central/easterner culture on the green sea coast north of the desert
    

- In south and far east, fall of Drankor has less influence and things proceed as during the empire, with modest changes in trade, communication, etc as a big vacuum is left in the west.
    

  

Then, the Great War strikes. The Dunmari are devasted, and ~Irebor~ is essentially entirely wiped out. The northern kingdom south of Pandar and north of the Great Lake are also essentially wiped out, more or less eliminating from the world the Drankor/northerner blend culture (what survives tot he south is more pure Drankorian, what survives on the coast/islands and far north is more pure Northerner). So, in the current day, you have the following human cultures:

  

- Broadly, the “Drankorian” cultures, who follow Mos Numena:
    

- In Greater Sembara, the Drankorian/”east northlander” blended culture
    
- In Cymea, ~SouthCymea~, Chardon, a more pure Drankorian culture
    

- Broadly, the Dunmari cultures, who follow the Divine Siblings:
    

- In Dunmar, the Dunmari themselves, a pure Dunmari culture that settled conquered land after the fall of Drankor
    
- In “EasternDunmar” on the south shore of the Green Sea, a more blended culture, Dunmari in religion but with Drankorian, eastern, and desert influences
    

- Broadly, the northern cultures, who follow the Northern Religion:
    

- The islands to the west of Chardon; the only northern group with significant population in the modern day
    
- The coastal people of the northern bay 
    
- The scattered people of the Far North
    

- Broadly, the eastern cultures who follow the Eastern Religion:
    

- These are generally pretty unified across the north and the central/eastern islands
    
- The Skaer are somewhat different/unique
    

- Broadly, the southern cultures, including the southern continent, left undeveloped, but with many strands: south coastal/island people, south continent people with Hkaran influence
    
- A few blended or unique cultures:
    

- Myraeni, who live in the Myraeni gap between Chardon and Dunmar and north on the slopes of the central mountains, an ancient people of mysterious origin
    
- The Illorians, a mixing pot culture of refugees and others from a variety of cultures in the west, perhaps a pluralistic societies in Taelgar without a dominant religion
    
- The peninsula west of Chardon, possibly just a part of the Chardonian empire or possibly a current homeland of Peronar/half-elves, still following ancient Hkaran traditions of blended cities with humans
    
- The desert people, a blend of non-Drankorian people living in the desert for the past 1000+ years, probably have their own unique pantheonic religion.
    
- The east coast, south of the eastern islands and east of the mountains, stretching south into the subtropics, who are probably an ancient civilization, founded around or even before Drankor but still surviving, representing a mix of Eastern and Southern cultures. However probably don’t have their own religion, instead follow either Eastern or Southern tradition, or perhaps another pluralistic place with no dominant religion.**


Comment on elder age/species:
What do elder races do pre-humans? hmm, yeah. not really decided.  
  
in the pre-human age, I think, except for a few bits of excitement like the sundering of the dwarves, they are just kind of ... there...   
  
nothing much happens, the world is static, things are probably kind of boring in a lot of ways. elves live, and die, and ponder the mysteries of the univese, but there isn't really history happening.   
  
yes, probably a bunch of spells get invented during these times, and dwarves excavate under the mountains, and elves build forest cities and empires grow, but their aren't really conflicts or anything to be the grist of history (although there are of course ancient remnants of the children of the divine, so all is not enternnaly quiet, there are probably some wars with giants or something). the elves do probably explore the other planes, and find the greater elementals on the elemental planes, and things like that. there are also a lot of magic items made, i assume.  
  
after humans come on the scene, things get more interesting. humans bring not only themselves, but demons and devils and a lot more powerful evil like that, and you have the events building to the great battles of the downfall.  
  
i mean, what do tolkein's elves do before they start fighting morgoth? they just sing and dance and write poetry and make magic items, they don't really **do** anything. i imagine talegar kind of like that. long age of not really doing much, humans -~ long age of increasingly bad stuff, then downfall.

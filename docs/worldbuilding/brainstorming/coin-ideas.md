## Hobgoblins

Hobgoblin trade coins used in Cha'mutte's armies, and still commonly used across the Blasted Plains, Plaguelands, and adjacent hobgoblin areas (but not necessarily in the north):

- dragons: worth 2 gp each, square gold coins with a hole in the center, typically stamped with Cha'mutte's mark, or more recently a clan mark
- talons: worth 2 sp each, silver disks stamps as above
- shards: worth 1 cp each, copper disks stamped as above

In Cha'mutte's army, quarter dragons, worth 5 sp, and great dragons, worth 10 gp, were also minted but are not typically used now.
## Dunmar

Coins are not commonly used in the current day in Eastern Dunmar, as much trade is conducted in barter and in kind.

The king in Nayahar mints coins, however, and these are in occasional use in the east.

Gold coins (worth 1 gp) are known as steeds; silver coins as rupas, and copper coins as taams.

Older coins from pre-Blood Years uses the same names, but tended to be larger and more pure, and so can trade for more than their 'face value'

Steeds = 2 gp

Rupas = 4 sp

Taams = 1 cp

(may change these values; 1 steed = 5 rupas = 400 taams, so 1 rupa = 80 taams)

## Chardon

The Chardonian Empire has issued coins for many, many years, in five denominations, but commonly only the 5 sp, 1 sp, and 1 cp are used in daily life. These are known as Chardonian livri as a whole, with individual coins as follows:

10 gp =

1 gp = imperial

5 sp =

1 sp =

1 cp =

The Chardon mint produces relatively pure coins and its coins are often preferred in trading to the Dunmari coins or various island nation or Northlander mints. The 1 gp = 10 sp = 100 cp conversion is derived from the Drankorian empire.

Chardonian coins have portrait of the magistros typically on one side, with a design on the reverse.

## Dwarves

Dwarven mints in the Yuvanti mountains and formerly of northern Dunmar produce both coins and trade bars in a variety of denominations.

The standard coins are:

5 gp =

2 sp

1 cp

Dwarves also mint and produce iron trading coins, known as nibs, that are backed by a gold standard but not otherwise containing any intrinsic worth. Nibs in 5 sp, 1 gp, 10 gp, and 50 gp are known.

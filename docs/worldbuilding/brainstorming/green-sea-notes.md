{title: Green Sea Notes}

Putting some notes on [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) ideas here.

Based on climatology, size, coastline, etc, general feeling is that the western [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) should feel kind of Mediterranean -- there isn't a lot of true open ocean, and the distances are just not that huge (it is in fact a big smaller from end to end than the Med, but also a bit wider from North to South).

In contrast, the eastern [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) is maybe more like the Arabian Sea and the complex of East African Coast, Arabian Peninsula, and West Indian coast. There is significant open water you need to traverse to head straight across, while at the same time it is possible to use monsoon winds / seasonal fluctuation of the trade winds to make a circuit quite reliably. 

### Winds

The [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) lies largely between 30 degrees and 55 degrees North. The high pressure zone of the horse latitudes in Taelgar tends to sit around 20ish degrees North in the winter, and drift north in the summer. This leads to dry climates and the deserts of Dunmar (aided by rain shadow of mountains) and the big central desert. 

This also means in the winter, you have consistent westerlies blowing through much of the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), with the wind blowing from west to east. 

In the summer, the land heats up, and low pressure expands over the open plains north of Sembara, which creates conditions for winds to reverse in the western part of the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), and brings summer rain to Sembara. 

In the east, as the high pressure area moves north, you get low pressure over the heating desert, and the trade winds reverse to be easterly along the southern coast.

In the western [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), there is not enough open ocean and the winds resemble the Mediterranean -- generally blowing west to east but with considerable variability because of land (so in the summer you get more east winds blowing rain from the ocean, for example). 

In the eastern [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), things are more consistent. As the high pressure ridge drifts north and the desert heats up, you get dry Mediterranean summers over the big island, and a switch to easterlies along the southern coast. 

### Currents

The prevailing currents in the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) are a warm current circulating along the southern coast east to west, and a colder current running west to east along the northern shore. 

### Trade routes

In the west, you have short distances and the ability to use the current to aid in sailing against the wind around Cymea, so trade routes are not greatly affected by the season. Generally avoiding late summer thunderstorms and avoiding winter storms, but otherwise kind of normal and boats trade among Tollen/Sembara/Cymea/Skaer/islands pretty routinely, although the big island is fairly exotic (Tollen - Big Island is approx distance of Rome - Jerusalem).

In the east, things are trickier. Generally travel east along the northern coast is easier in the summer, and travel west along the southern coast is easier in the summer. Additionally the northern ports are a lot nicer, with better weather, in the spring and summer; generally ships try to leave by early fall to avoid winter storms caused by cold winds blowing down from the interior as the land cools quicker than the oceans. The southern ports, in contrast, have dry, windless winters with high pressure and little rain. Not bad to spent the time in ports but hard to leave. 

A typical halfling ship plying the eastern [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) might have the following route. 
- In the spring, as the easterlies pick up, leave the south, trading along the coast, perhaps as far west as Cymea.
- Cross to Ursk by mid-June, before the summer monsoons, and spend a month or two in port. Some ships might sail further north/east, others to Skaer, but generally trade along the north coast in summer.  
- Leave the north coast by early fall, taking advantage of the winds blowing off the cooling land masses to the north, aided by the high pressure zone moving south
- Trade along the islands and coast south, aiming to reach the big desert ports by December before the winds die. 

Alternatively:
- Trade/sail along the southern coast in the summer as the easterlies get established, sailing from eastern islands, perhaps as far as Cymea, by fall. 
- Cross to the big island in the winter, perhaps overwintering there
- Either head north for a short visit to Ursk or related territories in the spring, or simply head east. 
- Return to south by the summer and trade along the coast again. 


## Places

### Skaer

Perhaps steal an idea from Neolithic Malta as per *The Great Sea*, and have some sacred islands inhabited only by servants of the ocean goddess, unapproachable by outsiders.

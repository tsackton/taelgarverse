Thinking a little bit about whaling in Taelgar.

Basic idea:

Whaling might have some morally gray boundaries, but I don't want to set things up so that there is a major industry that depends on hunting clearly fairly intelligent, graceful, powerful mammals. 

So a couple of ideas:
- whales are like elementals, or other kinds of magical creatures, and there are "minor" and "elder" variants; the minor whales might be like sheep or something; perhaps herded / shepherded by undersea cultures, used as livestock, etc. The "elder" whales are intelligent and magical. This could be the basis of Wellby's "don't hunt old whales" memory/
- could steal some ideas from https://keith-baker.com/ifaq-whaling/
- whaling doesn't have to be about whales, specifically, or exclusively (e.g., dragon turtles / drake turtles per Eberron post above)
- could also consider 'corrupted' variants, where whaling is usually focused on harvesting the "evil" whales, which has the side effect of whaling being kind of a "making the ocean safe" thing as well. maybe whales are actually quite intelligent, like elementals, but there are some that regularly attack ships and whalers hunt these.

Need to think a little about the resources gained here, as well.

### Rough Notes

I've been thinking about how to resolve the issue of the "evil races" just sitting around forever waiting for this big attack. This is some brainstorming rough notes to try to work out the demographics, feel, and history of the early ages of Taelgar in more detail, basically from the end of Years of Myth/creation of elves, to the fall of Hkar. 

#### Mythic History Logic

The way the mythic history of the world is supposed to work is the following:

1) the giants and dragons and fey and elements build huge empires and the gods walk the earth, but that is too chaotic so the planes are separated

2) the gods create the elder races, who expand and build empires and develop, and probably invent magic and things like that, but that is kinda boring so the gods create humans

3) humans expand and grow, but so do the "evil races", and then there is a huge battle and Hkar sinks

4) the age of "human history" begins and ends with the war against Cha'mutte

5) present day into the "new age"

  

The idea behind 2 is to try to make this feel different than Tolkien. Tolkien doesn't really have a period when the elves are just kind of doing their thing -- the conflict with Morgoth runs through the entire first age, and even the mythic prehistory alternates between times when Morgoth is fighting and times when he is imprisoned. So I definitely want a time that is just kind of elder races doing their thing, with little or no conflict (excepting things like the sundering of the dwarves, and anything else that gets invented later to explain things like drow or other exotic races, like maybe if I ever want to use yuan-ti they can be sundered lizardfolk). There is also a nice kind of parallel to having period 2 end with Ahra and Malik stepping into the world to create humans and that allowing the Despairs to sneak in as well and do their thing; during period 2 the world is kind of preserved in glass in a way. 

  

But my current inclination is to have age 1 be “great mythic empires and wars”, age 2 be “the long quiet growth of the elder races”, age 3 be “humans, hobgoblins, and all the rest appear and growth in the shadow of elder race empires, and then fight”, age 4 be “human empires”, age 5 be “present day”.

#### Timing of Age Breaks

As far as timing goes, there are two major considerations: period 2 needs to be long enough that the memory of creation begins to fade from the living memory of the elder races, and also so that the elder races don't need to be created in huge numbers to grow to reasonable population sizes by the height of their empires at the middle/end of period 3. 

  

Also, some numbers are fixed already:

  

Period 1 is canonically "before time". 

Period 2 and Period 3 could be as long or short as desired.

Period 4 is about 1500 years, which feels right to give time for the right amount of history (roughly from when Rome expands beyond Italy to end of the High Middle Ages in terms of European history; most fantasy worlds including Tolkien and Forgotten Realms have vastly too much time for human history)

Period 5 is ~200 years

The age of the world (periods 2-5) is 5881 years.

  

So that means 2+3 is about 4100 years, give or take 100. 

#### Demographics (Non-Human)

I did a little demographic modeling of the Eldar races, and with various reasonable assumptions, you end up with elves around 1.5mi, stoneborn 30k, lizardfolk 230k, dwarves 7.5m and halflings 3.5m at downfall of Hkar. Which makes a lot of sense: elves + dwarves are major races, with elves making up for lower pop numbers with more powerful magic. Halflings are around at about same level of humans, stoneborn rare, and lizardfolk mostly concentrated in their homelands along south and east of green sea (~200k) with only scattered outposts elsewhere (30k). 

  

My basic model is that most races are created with 5k individuals or so, but the first 2-3 generations have 2x-3x typical growth rates as mortality is low/zero, so you rapidly ramp up to ~10-50k. Then, just assume constant growth until the downfall. 

  

This assumes the age set / non-overlapping generations of elves, that lizardfolk and stoneborn both have long periods of fertility, very low per-year birth rates with moderately sized families, but also very low death rates. Basically, these are ~approx modeled on modern US, assuming very little infant mortality, long life expectancy, and high fraction of elderly in population. Lizardfolk are assumed to have slightly higher average family sizes to get a bit higher growth rate.

  

Dwarves and halflings are a bit more “baby boom US” family sizes, and slightly tweaked other parameters, to give somewhat higher growth rates. For dwarves this is through tendencies towards larger families, for halflings mostly through higher fraction of population of reproductive age.

  

During the downfall, elves suffer most, then dwarves almost as much. Other races lose <10% of pop. Lizardfolk migrate south in large numbers; stoneborn and halflings less affected. 


  

This leads to current day "northwest" population is maybe 200k elves, 50k stoneborn, 500k lizardfolk, 20m dwarves, 20m halflings, which feels about right.

  

But this has no implications for when humans are created, really. By ~1600-1800 those who can remember the days of creation, even among elves, are rare, so end of “period 2” could be as early as 1600 and as late as 2500 or so. 

#### Demographics (Human)

Human demographics have a bigger impact on the timing, since the question of where to put the boundary between period 2 and period 3 is largely one of how long should humans have to grow before the downfall of Hkar?



Working out details in spreadsheet.

  

### TL;DR

  

Elder Races created at the beginning of the 2nd age.

  

Not much happens.

  

Around 1700-1800, humans created on Hkar, and the “evil races” created / let in in lost corners of the world. Humans grow fast, initially, . Other races start smaller, without protection of Ahra/Malik.



This is the beginning of the 3rd Age. Eldar Races sense a change. Elves, most keenly, and begin to shift their posture to a defensive one, building strongholds and preparing for some as of yet unseen danger. 

  

Dwarves have a big conflict, those who think they should fortify underground vs those who think they should flee the mountains. The later become gnomes.

  

Other races less numerous and less important at this time (about 500k elves, 500k dwarves, 300k halflings, <100k of others).

  

Over the next 1000 years, things grow: humans, evil races, empires. 

  

By ~3000, about 1000 years before the fall of Hkar, the first humans are in the mainland, and the first tentative hints of orcs, hobgoblins, mind flayers and others reaches the elder races.

  

During the next 1000 years, there is a slow increase in tension. During this time is probably when the great northern wall is built, when the fey start to protect Tyrwingha, when lots of weird magical relics exist, when a lot of evocation and other offensive magic is developed by the elves, all that. 

  

By 4000 you have basically the start of a century long war that ends with a partial victory for the “good guys” and a partial defeat, in that Hkar is sacrificed (my vision here is that somehow -- details don’t matter -- a huge army of evil races landed on Hkar, and that its destruction was not a punishment for human failure or anything but a last ditch effect to save humanity from being overwhelmed. Maybe to stop hobgoblin army from getting some ancient powerful magic or to stop the Three Despairs from gaining access to some kind of secret of creation).

  

### Hkar migration

  

- Migration from Hkar largely in two waves, one early and one late.
    
- Early wave starts 800 years after humanity created, and peaks over the next 200 years. 
    

- Initially to north, then in larger numbers to south. 
    
- Leaving from eastern edge of Hkar, probably not a defined, unified culture
    
- Migration to north peaks first, and is in general smaller
    
- In north, bring a language and a version of the religious traditions that are dominant on Hkar at the time, but not ‘cohesive’ in the way later migrations are
    
- In south, bring a language, but later and bigger so room for more religious diversity if desired
    

- Followed by 600 years of growth on Hkar, some small waves of migration and some trade/travel back and forth, but not a lot. Most contact/migration goes to western islands in the north, and to the south, little to northern mainland.
    
- Major period of urbanization, religious evolution, and magical development on Hkar; people who left probably seen in many ways as backwards and uninteresting
    
- Late wave starts in about 1600 years after humanity is created, and largely driven by non-dominant Hkaran cultures leaving. 
    

- Dominant culture is the eastern mariner culture, who leave to the west, reach the east, and then begin to migrate en mass
    
- Other, smaller groups leave (Central people). The most prominent of these is the proto-Dunmari, but room for other groups here as well
    
- These are culturally cohesive exodi, so probably each migration initially shares a religion
    

- Languages:
    

- On Hkar, language evolves but does not diverge into different branches. But once on mainland, those offshoots diverge.
    

- First two departures (Northern and Southern) bring each a different language group (Northros and Southros)
    
- The eastern, central, and Drankorian/other continent departures are share a common root
    

- Eastern is most cohesive and diverges a bit more, into “Eastros”
    
- Central, Drankorian, and “Other Continent” most closely related
    

- On mainland:
    

- Northros diverges into various northern tongues, probably 2-4, plus one that is extinct used by the people in the highlands of Sembara before easterners came
    
- Southros diverges into some number of languages to be decided later
    
- Eastros splits into two major language groups (western and eastern) based on the religious schism, with the “western Green sea” language replacing the “highland Northros”. 
    

- Western now basically Skaegish; eastern split more?
    

- Central languages diverge based on cultural group
    
- Drankorian then becomes language of dominant empire, and later splits into Sembaran and Chardonian
    

- The whole Eastern/Central/Drankorian group, the “late Hkaran” tongues, are distantly related and use Indo-European languages as analogues
    
- The Northern and Southern groups are very distinct and use other language families as analogous (tentatively, Semitc and Asian respectively).

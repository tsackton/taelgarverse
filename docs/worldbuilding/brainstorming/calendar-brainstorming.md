Thinking a little bit about calendar systems (human only, for now).

  
## On Hkar

The first humans had no need of a calendar, or really to track the passage of years. Hkar was a large subtropical/tropical island with abundant rainfall, oceanic breezes that kept the temperatures relatively mild year round, and relatively little seasonality in general. 

Early migrants, like the northerners, presumably adapted calendars on the mainland, for religious and practical reasons. These were likely purely lunar calendars with some kind of ad hoc intercalation, that now no longer survive intact, or have been merged with the common calendar. 

In Hkar, you have two kinds of calendars begin to develop, for different reasons. 

In the urban parts of Hkar – the culture of Mos Numena, that eventually becomes the culture of Drankor – you have a system that grows up around magical cycles, with the 7 day week being of fundamental importance. A ritual cycle of 50 weeks, with 15 intercalary days (10 following the winter solstice; 3 on and around the summer solstice; 1 at the autumnal equinox, 1 at the vernal equinox), forms the basis of the urban Hkar year. For convenience, the 50 weeks are split into 10 groups of 5 weeks (months). Because a solar year in Taelgar is exactly 365 days, there are no leap years in this calendar, and it never goes out of sync (which also means the dates of the solstices and equinoxes never change). 

The importance of this ritual cycle is lost to time, but was strongly tied to magical practices. 

Among the mariners, a lunisolar calendar develops, that uses 12 lunar months of 29 or 30 days, with intercalary days/months inserted when needed to keep in sync with the solar year (very similar to e.g. ancient Mesoptamian calendars).

Drankor

Drankor largely adopts the urban Hkar calendar,

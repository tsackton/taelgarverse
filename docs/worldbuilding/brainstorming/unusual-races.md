# Deva
Exist, not sure about lore yet.

Introduced one that crashed to the world via a meteor. I guess implies meteors are associated with extraplanar travel somehow.

# Merfolk
May exist many places in the world. 

Ambiguous gender. Perhaps switch sexes during development like some fish?

Otherwise few details determined.

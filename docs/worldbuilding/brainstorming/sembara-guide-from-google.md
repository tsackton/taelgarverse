## Geography, Climate, and Ecology

Sembara is an ancient kingdom blessed with mild weather, amble rain, and rich fertile soil. Largely unchanged by the upheavals of the Great War, farmers plant winter wheat and summer millet and soybeans largely as they have for thousands of years. Five major river systems, fed by the summer rains, and melting snowpack and glaciers from the mountains, define the region: in the northeast, the Kem and Niva rivers spill down from the northern plateau across Vostok. Further west, the mighty Volta, wide and cold, flows past Tollen into the Green Sea. South of the Volta is the swift flowing Teft, then the placid Semb, and finally the southern Wistel and Enst rivers, which merge in the great marshy delta of ~LizardfolkSwamp~.

  

The rise and fall of the land further defines the region: in the west, the towering ~CentralMountains~ rise thousands of feet into the air. Few travelers cross these high peaks, save on the guarded underground roads of the dwarves. East of the mountains lie the Sembaran Highlands, a rough land that slowly descends to the Aine and Braebine Hills. East of the highlands is the Great Central Plain, a vast flat plain, stretching from the Mostreve Hills in the south to the Volta River in the north. North of the Teft, the plain stretches toward the mountains until the Northern Highlands start to rise up. In the west, the plain ends along the line of the Aine and Braebine Hills. In the east, it ends just east of the Volta River, as the land rises to the ~VostokHills~ before descending again to the  

#### Climatic Overview

The climate of Sembara is shaped by several major factors:

  

- In the summer, warm winds blow from the Green Sea, bringing heavy rain and muggy air
    
- In the winter, a high pressure system develops over the northern plateau, and the winds come from the west over the ~CentralMountains~. This is a cold and dry season.
    
- The Green Sea, in the east, provides a 
    

  

In general, the region’s climate is temperate, with four distinct seasons, dry winters, and wet summers. During the summer months, a monsoon wind blows from the Green Sea, bringing ample rainfall. In winter, high pressure builds over the northern steppe, and the west winds that blow over the mountains are dry and cold. 

#### The Northern Steppe

In the high north, the bitter, dry winters last late into May, and in the darkest and coldest days, the temperature can hover around 0 F for many weeks. The ground freezes, but little snow falls, as the dry westerly winds carry no moisture. By June, when the brief summer comes, the winds shift, and bring warmer air from the Green Sea. What little rain does fall comes in this brief summer, almost all in July and August. The air begins to chill again in September, and by November, even the ground has frozen over again.

  

Despite the cold, the northern steppe is not completely inhospitable. The summer brings long days, and grasses grow fast across the landscape. Great mammoths wander the plain, as do herds of hardy shaggy horses and wooly rhinoceroses. Stalking them are the winter wolves, fierce predators the size of small bears. 

#### The Northern Plateau

On the southern edge of the steppe, the land rises to a plateau, bordered on the west by the ~CentralMountains~ and on the east by the ~VostokMountains~. In the east, ~UnnamedLake1~ and the Great North Wall dominate the plateau. In the west, the glacial-fed headwaters of the Volta pour down off the highlands in the spring.

  

Rising to several thousand feet in the central regions, this plateau is cold and dry in the winter, and experiences a brief, wet summer in July and August as the warm winds from the Green Sea blow in. Much of the region is a land of short grasses although the landscape is dotted with stands of trees. Bison roam across much of the area and there is little agriculture, although cultivation of cold-weather grains such as barley is common in the western areas.

  

Spilling off the southern edge of plateau is a large band of mixed forest, with ancient redwoods towering over a mixed forest of pine, spruce, and elm. This forest band stretches from the Volta headwaters east to the coast near the Skaer Islands.

#### The Western Plateau

Starting from the Braebine and Aine Hills, the land rises to the north and west, forming a hilly, highland area rising towards the ~CentralMountains~. This land is wetter and warmer than the north, and rain falls regularly in the summer months. Little precipitation falls in the winter, although what does fall, falls as snow.

## People and Places

The region is dominated by the Kingdom of Sembara and Tyrwingha, a personal union of the two most important kingdoms, which dominates the political universe. North of Sembara lies the Highland Kingdoms: Zovcka, to the far north, Breva, to its south, and Lavnoch and Ardlas to the north and south of long Lake Derwent at the headwaters of the River Semb. To the west, the high peaks of the ~CentralMountains~ reach to the sky, forming an almost impassable boundary. To the east, the Green Sea beckons, and merchant ships ply its calm waters, carrying trade from Cymea, a land of city-states and ancient wizardry, Skaegenland, the cold northern islands, home to the independent and proud Skaer people, and exotic lands further east.

  

Along the northeastern border of the Kingdom of Sembara runs the mighty Volta River, dividing Sembara from Vostok, a land of many rivers, bitter winters, and small kingdoms. At the mouth of the Volta sits the Free City of Tollen, an independent city-state known for its merchant guilds, scholarship, wizards, and free-wheeling culture, a blend of the fierce independence of the Skaer, the ancient learning of Drankor, and the commercial and mercantile prowess of the Sembaran Northlands.  

  

South of Sembara, beyond the Mostreve Hills lie the Plaguelands, a desolate and accursed land, still not recovered from an ancient curse. 

### Sembara

The Kingdom of Sembara is divided into five major regions, each with important cultural differences, but ultimately, they share a religion, a language, and a common history.

#### The Heartlands

The heartlands are a rich agricultural region in the lowlands between the Enst, in the south, and the Teft, in the north. Much of this region, around the River Semb, is the Duchy of Sembara, a powerful and rich farming region, control of which is the source of much of the monarch’s power. This land is the breadbasket of Sembara.

  

Four other powerful duchies make up the rest of the heartland: the Duchy of Wisford, around the Wistel River and stretching south to the Enst; the Duchy of Arnsbury, in the north; the Duchy of Cheimen, in the west between the Semb and Wistel rivers; and the Duchy Seham along the coast.

  

Perched on a bluff above the River Semb, the capital city of Embry is a bustling river port of approximately 50,000 souls. It is home to the royal court, trade missions from much of the Green Sea, and bustling markets. Dating to Drankorian times, the city boasts that it has never been taken by siege, and the great northern gates are said to have been built by ancient Drankorian magic. It sits along the Great North Road, a major road running from Wisford, on the Wistel River, north to Embry, across the River Teft, and finally to the Free City of Tollen.

#### The Northlands

The region, between the swift and unnavigable River Teft and the mighty Volta was the old borderlands of the Drankorian empire, and today it still preserves a distinct culture. In modern times, much of the region is part of Duchy of Telham, which covers most of the southern two thirds of the region, except for some scattered coastal lords with historic ties to the Duke of Sembara or the Duke of Seham. The northern parts of the region are a land of small lords and small towns nestled along the rushing Teft or placid Volta. These townsfolk and their lords are often fiercely proud of their ancient bloodlines. History is deep here, and many families claim to trace their lineage back to Drankorian times. Timbercraft and metalworking are both particularly common here and lumber from the highlands is made into fine furniture in several small towns along the small streams that feed the Teft. The coastal lands are known for boatbuilding, and the chief city of the region, Telham, nestled at the head of a small bay, is a shipyard of some note, supplying the halfling traders who crisscross the Green Sea and the small Sembaran navy.. Clustered along the coast, many of the small towns specialized in clothing and manufacture of fine clothes and cloth from wool. 

  

In terms of natural resources, the salt flats along the coast are a major source of wealth. In the areas north of the Duchy of Telham, livestock is a major source of wealth, and cattle and sheep are raised in the more marginal lands along the borders with Breva.

  

#### The Highlands

North and west of Cheimen the foothills of the ~CentralMountains~ raise the land. Here live sheepherders and goat herders, small free farmers, and a scattering of ancestral baronies. This land is split by the Aine Hills, a densely forested and rough highland that divides the watersheds of the River Semb from the watersheds of the River Wistel. Culturally the Semb watershed is often closely aligned with the northern parts of Arnsbury. This area is pocketed with free villages and small lords, and allegiances here are sometimes more aligned with the highland kingdoms than the Sembaran crown. The Wistel watershed is more densely settled, and is a land of with a stronger allegiance to the crown.

  

Recent revitalization of trade has seen a growth in the importance of woolen fabrics, and a handful of baronies have seen their fortunes grow substantially during the peaceful years of Cece I. This land is especially welcoming to traders, and halflings are common here. Several halfling clans have established a significant presence, especially in the Wistel watershed, where regular caravans of goods travel down the river to Wisford, overland to Embry along the North Road, and then along the coast to Tollen and the Duchy of Telham, where the wool is spun into fine fabrics sold all over the Green Sea.

#### The Borderlands

#### The Western Marches

The Western Marches are divided into four regions: the Marches of Enford, in the foothills between the north and central branches of the River Enst; the Barony of Ainwick, centered around Ainwick on the River Wistel; the Barony of Dunfry, amongst the flat lands north of the Enst, and the Marches of ~CentralMountains~, north of the Wistel. Much of this land was war-torn and devastated by the Western War three generations ago, and is still underpopulated. The Marches of Enford and much of the Barony of Dunfry in particular were overrun by ~EvilArmy~, and subjugated, and the marks of that occupation on the land and the people are still evident.

  

The Marches of Enford are a land of frontier lords. Although nominally sworn to the crown of Sembara, the lords in this region are freed from most taxes and royal prerogatives. It is a dangerous land, as the ~CentralMountains~ are not free of danger, but also a land of opportunity. 

  

The Barony of Ainwick is more a military district in some ways than a barony. There are two major garrisons of troops stationed here: the North Watch and the Central Watch. The North Watch maintains a line of castles from the Wistel to the river border with Ardlas; the Central Watch is responsible for the northern part of the ~WallNearUrlich~. These garrisons are supported by the crown, and much of the economy of the region is dedicated to feeding, equipping, and supporting them. 

  

The Barony of Dunfry is also a major military district, responsible for the South Watch, which guards the southern half of the ~WallNearUrlich~ and also maintains a series of forts along the north branch of the Enst.

  

The Marches of ~CentralMountains~ have much in common with Ardlas, and although most lords here are sworn to the crown, like in the Marches of Enford, a frontier spirit pervades. 

  
  

### Tyrwingha

The Kingdom of Tyrwingha has a distinct political culture and history from Sembara. In 1657, the crowns are united, and Elaine II reigns as the Queen of the United Crowns of Sembara and Tyrwingha. 

Capital: Tafolwern

### Addermarch

Nestled in the Mostreve Hills south and west of Tyrwingha lies the border kingdom of Addermarch. One of the rich border provinces of the Kingdom of Sembara in the time before the Great War, Addermarch enjoyed the wealth that came with control of the headwaters of the River Aure, which forms the south branch of the Enst and was a major trade connection between the Insingue and Sembara. However, during and after the Great War, Addermarch was devastated, and much of its population fled, starved, or were killed.

  

In the 1550s, the population of Addermarch began to grow again, in part from refugees from the south claiming unfarmed land. A strong feudal system developed, driven largely by the need for constant defense against ever-present dangers lurking in the Plaguelands to the south, and especially the haunted Darkwood on Addermarch’s southern frontier. 

  

Now, Addermarch is a land of small farmers, foresters, and sheepherders, known primarily for its famed apple brandy that is traded downriver into Sembara, but also a significant producer of timber and wool. Enjoying favorable tariffs for its goods in exchange for its role in protecting Sembara’s southern borders, Addermarch is a close ally of Sembara.  

  

### The Duchy of Maseau

This land is a borderland and was essentially depopulated during the Great War. It was never a land blessed with rich natural resources, and before the Great War thrived on the trade flowing through the gap in the Mostreve Hills. 

  

~Still thinking on this, one idea is that the “Southern Marches 1” is entirely south of the mountains, and the rest of the SM1 that was north of the mountains is actually part of the Marches of Enford. SM1 ends up not really being a organized anything, it is more the name for whoever lives along the trade road running south, maybe mostly mountain folk who survived the great war and blood years,  who have formed a cultural with the refugees from the plaguelands -- sorta like the Beoring idea you had. But no real kings, lords, organized political entity, and frankly, not that many people.

## A Chronicle of Sembara History

### The Settlement of Greater Sembara

The first people to settle the western Green Sea, in the Elder Days when the world was young, were the Elder races. Even in these days, the western edge of the Green Sea was a place were cultures mixed and intertwined. In Sembara of those days, lizardfolk settled in the great swamps that spread in the lowlands around the rivers; dwarves built great cities under the mountains; elves settled in the forested slopes of the Mostreve hills and the ~CymeanMountains~; while halflings sailed and walked the land, telling stories and bringing music. No great empires or vast kingdoms arose during this time. Instead, the land was as if in a dream, bursting with life and the joy of nature, touched by the fey and the magic of the younger land. 

  

It was into this environment that the first humans ventured into the land. Coming from over the mountains to the west, these first settlers brought with them a new language, and a culture of worshipping small gods of the land. These humans lived in the shadow of the Elder races for a long time, never very numerous, mostly dwelling on the edges of society. But, in this land of dreams where magic was strong, their gods flourished, and the small gods of the their northern folk traditions grew powerful.

  

Some time later, halfling traders began to bring stories out of the East of another people, a people not living in the shadows of the Elder races, but spreading across the land, building cities and kingdoms and speaking a new language, Eastros. Halflings -- always adept with languages -- begin to bring this new language around the Green Sea, where it gains a bit of a status as a lingua franca, a trade tongue. Many of the diverse races of the Greater Sembara region begin speaking Eastros to communicate with each other, and the eastern mariners begin to spread towards the west.

  

Soon, the mariners have arrived, and begin to settle on the islands and coasts of the western Green Sea. Few of the people who live here are seagoing -- except the halflings, who built no cities -- and there is land and space to spare along the shores and islands of what will become Cymea, Sembara, Vostok, and Skaegenland. These mariners tell stories of the great human cities out east, and begin to build cities themselves. They also bring stories of conflict and strife and upheavals, that they are fleeing.

  

While the mariners bring their own gods, an ancient pantheon now largely lost to time, they are becoming weak and some are beginning to fade, rarely able to grant the prayers of their worshippers. The local gods in Sembara are strong, and many turn to them. A new religious tradition develops, borrowing some ideas about worship practice from the mariner culture, but worshipping the local gods of the northern people. This tradition, called the Kestavo, spreads across the inland regions of Sembara; only on the islands, where there are no local gods to worship, does the old mariner religion persist among the Skaer people.

  

As the years of conflict leading to the downfall of Hkar loom, a new human culture has emerged in the Greater Sembara region, a blend of the eastern mariner culture and the northern folk culture. This culture takes from the mariners an alphabet (as the northern people who settled here had little written tradition), and from the northerners the gods. While in the highlands the northern traditions are stronger, and on the lowlands the mariner culture remains less influenced by the northern people, both the language and the religion spread widely (excepting the Skaer Islands).

  

Few tales come down to us of the years of conflict of the downfall. Rumors of great deeds of heroism, of the elves sacrificing themselves in huge numbers to stop the extinction of humans, of a great wall in the north, built or rebuilt to stop the hoards, of the archfey themselves reaching out to help the land, all feature in the myths of this time, but even the best Tollen scholars cannot tell what is true. 

  

As stability returned in the generations after the downfall, the Sembara region stood changed. As the Elder races retreated, humans spread, and “east northerner” culture, worshipping the Kestavo and speaking Eastros, spread the widest and furthest, until the coming of the Drankorian Empire. 

### A Drankorian Background

Much of Sembaran history arises from the fractured duchies that arose from the fall of the Drankorian Empire, and the boundaries of the ancient Drankorian provinces still impact the political geography of the land today. 

  

A thousand years ago, the Drankorian Empire expanded beyond the Mostreve Hills, and the scattered people of the Semb, Enst and Wistel river valleys were rapidly assimilated. The Drankorians brought modern roads, improved agricultural techniques, and a new religion to the land. Farming and pastoralism was a way of life here, with little technology and little trade. No great wars were fought, the scholars say, and over the generations the old ways were forgotten. Within two lifetimes, a border had been established along the River Volta, and few between the Teft and the Mostreve Hills remembered the days before the coming of the Drankorians.

  

In the northern highlands however, and especially amongst the many lakes at the headwaters of the Volta, the Drankorian armies bogged down in the cold, snowy winters, and it is said the very skies and earth rose up to defend the highlanders. Conquest was slow and often abandoned, and in the mountain valleys the Eight Divines were not widely acknowledged, and the old gods still worshipped.

  

In the south, the Kingdom of Tyrwingha, nestled on the southern shores of the Green Sea, was also never conquered by Drankor. This land had been protected by the Archfey Ethlenn, the Queen of the Rising Sun, Princess of Mist and Sea, for many generations, and the conquerors had not her blessing. It is said that the greatest wizards of Drankor refused to aid the conquest, recognizing Ethlenn’s great power, and the legions of Drankor, feared throughout the world, threw down their arms. Whether this tales are true or not, it is known that the Empire did not conqueror Tyrwingha. Yet the Archfey greatly desired to learn the secrets of Hkar from Drankorian mages, and so a compromise was made. The Archfey would acknowledge the Drankorians as rulers of the land, in exchange for tribute in the form of secret knowledge, and any Tyrwinghans who did not want to live under Drankorian rule would be allowed to depart for the Feywild, to live in the court of the Archfey. Even now, tradition in Tyrwingha holds that all subjects of the Tyrwinghan crown may choose to invoke their right to leave, trading their oaths of loyalty to the Tyrwinghan throne for a life in the court of the Archfey, although Ethlenn herself has not been seen or heard for generations, and few but the desparate or fey-touched choose this gamble now. 

  

Thus in the years before the Great Plague and the Fall of Drankor, all the lands that would later become Sembara were rich, prosperous, agricultural provinces of the Empire. 

### The Six Duchies

Then came the Plague, and the collapse of order that followed. Little is known of the history of these times, but the line of the Dukes of Sembara began in DR 1142, it is said. By 1250 DR, the six duchies (Sembara, Cheimen, Wisford, Seham, Telham, and Arnbury) were firmly established, and the Duke of Sembara was acknowledged as the chief amongst them, and the other dukes, save Telham, acknowledged the feudal overlordship of Sembara.

  

Over the next generation, a series of small summer conquests slowly added territory to the growing Kingdom of Sembara, as minor lords pledge fealty to the King of Sembara. Some did so because an army of 1000 Sembaran knights showed up at their castle, and they felt they had no choice; others did so to gain protection from their rivals and ensure stability for their people. The dukes of the five duchies and their knights and vassals become rich from these summer conquests as well as the fertile lands and the slow revival of trade in the Green Sea. 

  

By 1300 DR, the Sembaran monarchy commands fealty, either directly, from newly minted barons, or indirectly, from lords sworn to the barons and dukes sworn to the crown, most of the lowlands between the Teft and the Enst. For the next hundred years or so, the Green Sea is peaceful and prosperous. Sembara grows rich on the strength of its agricultural wealth, and its borders solidify: the river Teft to the north, the river Enst to the south, with the western border stretching roughly in a line from the source of the Enst through the Aine Hills to Braebein, the highlands north of Arnsbury. 

### The Unification of Sembara Under the House of Sewick

By DR 1400, a number of regional powers had started to emerge on the borders of Sembara. In the northwest, from the highland provinces of Drankor, two kingdoms had emerged: Lavnoch and Ardlas. Perched on either side of Lake Derwent, these kingdoms grew rich with the profit of trade over the mountains, but were often in conflict over control of the lake and access to the Dwarven trade.

  

North of Lavnoch, the brief unified crown of Zovcka had collapsed, and two northern kingdoms emerged: Zovcka, in the north, and Breva, squeezed between Braebein and the growing power of the Duke of Arnbury, the ~CentralMountains~, and Zovcka. 

  

To the northeast, the Duchy of Telham, between the Teft and the Volta, commanded the loyalty of many of the small lords along the coast and the rivers, and was closely tied by culture and intermarriage to Sembara.

  

South of Sembara were two major powers: the Kingdom of Tyrwingha, which emerged from the fall of Drankor largely intact and still under the guardianship of the Archfey Ethlenn, and the Dominion of Avatus, a rising military autocracy exerting overlordship of a number of small kingdoms in the Mostreve Hills, growing in power by taxing trade and recruiting mercenaries, largely hobgoblins.

  

#### Crisis and the Emergence of the House of Sewick

While Sembara thrived during the long peace, underneath, the seeds of conflict grew. A series of weak rulers had ceded many of the royal prerogatives to the dukes and a feeling of security encouraged the dukes to pour resources into fine trade goods and luxuries, rather than castles and maintaining men-at-arms. Crushing tariffs on Dwarven goods enriched the border lords, but alienated many others, including Ardlas and Lavnoch, who had traditionally enjoyed strong trade relations with Sembara. And prophets throughout Tyrwingha were preaching of the End Times, and whole villages were found to have disappeared. Whether fled to the safety of the Feywild, or consumed by darkness, few could answer.

  

In DR 1425, Atavus saw an opportunity. With a mercenary army consisting largely of hobgoblins and vicious werewolves, he launched an invasion across the Enst. A series of disasters befell the Sembarans -- the Duke of Cheimin refused to march his troops south of the Wistel, three hundred knights from Seham were lost in a summer storm at sea, and the muster of Arnsbury sent only half the men due to crown, claiming insufficient horses. And the expected help from Tyrwingha fails to materialize -- the Queen herself commanded her knights to stay within the Tyrwinghan borders. And so the Sembaran army, defeated on the field, retreated with half its force to winter north of the Wistel, and the ~MilitaryDictator~ paused to consolidate his gains, and prepared to strike north and east.

Into this moment rode Derik I, a distant relative of the current king, but far from the kingship himself. He had married the second daughter of the Duchess of Telham, on the Northlands coast, and had made a name for himself as a military commander in a series of skirmishes against pirates on the coast, in alliance with Tollen mercenaries and halflings.

  

In the months following the advance of Atavus to the Wistel, a lizardfolk elder had approached Derik, and told him of an omen: he was prophesied to raise a mighty Sembara to form a pillar of strength in the dark times to come, and if he did not overthrow Avatus, the smallest cloud in the coming storm, the darkest shadows of today would seem like the brightest diamonds of tomorrow. But it was also foretold, this elder said, that only the Princess of the Mist could herald his coming.

  

With the blessing of his mother-in-law, Derik sent a small tithe of the knights of the Duchy of Telham south to aid their ally, the King, and then he sailed with the bulk of the duchy’s forces to Tyrwingha. There, the old queen had been wracked by dreams of the horrible fate that would befall Tyrwingha if she entered the war, and so had kept her forces away, despite her misgivings for not aiding an ally.

  

When Derik arrived in Tyrwingha, he immediately disembarked and spoke with the queen. It is said that as he set foot on Tyrwinghan shores, the morning fog parted, and turned golden where he stepped, leaving a trail of sparklingly mist behind him. Crowds began to follow, and when he reached the castle, the people of Tyrwingha were watching as he bowed his head humbly to ask to speak with the queen, and Archfey Ethlenn herself appeared before him, and proclaimed that he would be the savior of Tyrwingha, and kissed him on the forehead, passing him her blessing. 

  

As news spread like wildfire of a knight from the north who had been blessed by Ethlenn herself, Derik was quickly proclaimed Derik I, King of Tyrwingha by the nobility of the land. Derik gathered an army of lizardfolk, the knights of Telham and Tyrwingha, the fey-touched warlocks of the Ethlenn, and Tollen and Vostok mercenaries, which he marched west in the early spring of 1426. Derik drove the forces of ~MilitaryDictator~ before him, and the ~NewDrankorianEmpire~ army is flanked on the banks of the Wistel and decisively defeated by Derik at the Battle of Wisford. 

  

By the end of the summer of 1428, the war was over. Derik’s alliance, following the initial success of the Battle of Wisford in 1426, which broke ~MilitaryDictator~’s lines on the Wistel, and the Battle of Fellburn in 1427, which forced ~MilitaryDictator~ across the Enst, won a decisive and complete victory at the Battle of Dalfield, in the northern Mosteve Hills, in the spring of 1428. 

  

Cloaked in glory and honor from his decisive military leadership and fey-enhanced charisma, Derik forged modern Sembara at the Treaty of Wisford, signed in the late fall of 1428, which established the Royal Council, codified the independence of lizardfolk in the realm forevermore, and cemented the House of Sewick as the rulers of the Joined Crowns of Sembara, Tyrwingha, and Telham.  

  

In the spring and summer of 1429, Derik, now styling himself Derik I of Sewick, King of Sembara, Duke of Telham, High Prince of Tyrwingha, Honored Consort of the Queen of Morning, and Defender of the Four Rivers, marches his army throughout the Mosteve Hills, driving out the last of the hobgoblins and accepting the fealty of the local lords. 

  

In the fall of 1429, the Treaty of Valarin (a small town in the “gap” in the southern highlands) establishes relations between the Kingdom of Sembara and the Irebor Alliance, a loose confederation of city states and freeholds to the south that is emerging out of the fall of ~NewDrankorEmpire~, setting the extent of Sembara’s control at the southern edge of the highlands. 

  

The rest of Derik I’s long reign is a time of renewed prosperity in Sembara, as trade to the south flourishes, the war-torn Borderlands and Southern Marches revive considerably on the strength of goods flowing across their lands, and occasional raiders from the mountains are met with the full might of Sembara’s army with Derik I at the head.

#### The Northern Wars

The reign of Derik II is relatively uneventful, and the traditions and formalities of the kingdom are established and propagated in this time. The borders to the south, with the Irebor Alliance, and the north, with the fractured fiefdoms of Vostok, are uneventful, and trading relationships with Cymea and the rest of the eastern Green Sea grow during this time. 

  

The only thing that mars the peace of this era is increasing tensions among the highland kingdoms. Several small wars break out between Ardlas and Lavnoch, fighting over control of the headwaters of the Semb and Lake Derwent, and with it access to the lucrative Dwarven trade, while tensions increase between Breva and the Dwarves over the resources of the upper Teft. Although the violence never spills over into Sembara, trade is disrupted and what to do about the highlands is a constant question during the reign of Derik II. Derik II, although a strong king and diplomat, is not the military leader his father was, and was reluctant to raise taxes for an invasion.   

  

Several times the dwarves send diplomatic missions to Sembara, asking the king to deal with his people making trouble, and several times Derik II says there is nothing he can do. By the 1490s, it is clear the situation is untenable, as at this point both the halflings and dwarves are complaining to the king and telling him to get these unruly humans under control before they take it into their own hands, to ensure stability, but at this point Derik II is old, and uncertain, and so nothing is done.

  

Gyles I, Derik II’s son, inherits the crisis. Unwilling to let relations with the dwarves deteriorate further, Gyles I rides with a large army up the River Semb, and in a relatively bloodless series of campaigns forces Ardlas and Lavnoch to the negotiating table, asserting suzerainty over the territory of these kingdoms. Breva, fearing conquest, ceases hostilities with the dwarves, and Gyles I pushes no further, for by 1508 DR, rumors of something terrible in the north are growing. 

  

#### The Preamble to the Great War

After his defeat as the hidden puppet master of ~NewDrankorEmpire~, Cha’mutte has turned his attention north, where far across the ~CentralMountains~ he is growing an empire in ~FormerlyKnownAsPandar~. Still maintaining footholds in the southern ~CentralMountains~ where several loyal hobgoblin tribes attempt to prevent the consolidation of the Irebor Alliance into a united front, he has turned his attention to a move from the north, through the empty northern steppes. Still working through proxies, and not ready to show himself yet, he summoned one of his dragonspawn, the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and set him to gather allies across the northern plains -- orcs, monstrosities, ogres, and trolls -- and set upon Vostok from the north. 

  

At the same time, a group of religious fanatics worshipping an old god began to establish themselves in Zovcka and the Volta borderlands in Vostok, taking control of Zovcka and persecuting followers of the Eightfold Way.

  

Derik III, 19 years old in 1508 DR, is sent to the north. Vostok at this point is ruled in the east by descendants of Skaer raiders, in the lakes region along the Volta increasingly by the followers of ~OldGod~, around Tollen largely as an oligarchy of rich merchants, and to the north as a loose confederation of semi-nomadic tribes. Derik III, channeling the charisma of his great-grandfather, cloaked in the blessing of the Gods, leads a grand alliance north to repair the ancient wall and defeat the dragon. In response, he is acknowledged as Prince of the North, and when he comes to the throne he is acknowledged as high king by the people of Vostok. Tollen retains its charter as a free city, but acknowledges the suzerainty of Derik III. 

  

While this is a great victory, in the meantime the situation has deteriorated in Zovcka and Breva. The religious cult has come to fully control Zovcka, and citizens of Breva are pissed that Sembara ignored their plight and suffering to fight battles in foreign lands. 

  

In DR 1511, Derik III, still Prince and Heir, leads a campaign to the highlands. The conquest is bitter, as Breva descends into civil war with some of the people on the side of Sembara and others on the side of OldGod. Sembara prevails, and forces of OldGod flee to Zovcka, but the price is high, and Derik III does not pursue military conquest of Zovcka. 

  

In DR 1523, shortly after Derik III comes to the throne, he finally launches a campaign against OldGod (perhaps now revealed to be stoked/encouraged by Cha’mutte), with the aid and support of the local lords on the Vostok side of the Volta. Zovcka is defeated, but worshippers of OldGod slip into hiding. Zovcka nominally acknowledges the overlordship of Sembara, but the local lords are not replaced, only forced to renounce OldGod. 

  

By DR 1525, Derik III is at least nominally acknowledged as the overlord and high king of all the land from the southern highlands to the northern wall, from the central mountains to the green sea. 

  

In DR 1533, now several years a widower, Derik III marries Jane, the young daughter of an important merchant family in Tollen. 

  

Derik III spends much of the next 20 years defending the borders of his expanded kingdom from various threats, until eventually the Great War breaks out. 

### The Blood Years

After the destruction of Urlich Monastery and the defeat of Cha’mutte, Sembara experienced just over a year of much needed peace, marked largely by a huge influx of refugees from the south who are largely settled in what will become the southern marcher kingdoms. In DR 1547. the peace is shattered by a large, grim army following from the south on the heels of the refugees -- first a grim hobgoblin army, then a disorganized mass of monstrosities, great beasts, and other fell terrors fleeing something even worse from the south. Sembara fights to a desperate standstill, holding ground in the Mosteve Hills for several years of death and famine. In the fall of 1549, Derik III dies on the battlefield near Valarin -- but in death, he wins a great victory, and a measure of peace for Sembara, as the last great host of hobgoblins is ridden down and killed. 

  

Bertam I, Derik’s youngest son, takes the throne in December of 1549, still a boy of 13. His mother, Jane, is appointed regent, and Bertram’s entire kingship is dominated by her, a shrewd woman who disliked waste. 

  

Bertram is not put forward as an heir by the Tyrwinghan royal electors, and instead a local duke ascended to the throne. War-weary, and pragmatic by nature, Jane councils forcefully against any attempt to retake Tyrwingha by might of arms, and focused the kingdom on rebuilding the six duchies. In 1550, Rumors of an endless horde of orcs, and worse, reach Embry from Vostok in this time, and an embassy from several of the Vostok chieftains arrives, but is turned back with only a company of knights to support it, none of whom ever return to Sembara. But whatever chaos consumes the north, little of it reaches the Volta, save for rumors. But Jane and Bertram drop the title “High King of Vostok” from the royal titles and Vostok turns inward -- and to the kenku -- for its defense. 

  

The year 1551 starts poorly, as winter lingers and it seems like spring will never come. And then, when spring does come, it comes in a season of unseasonably endless rain. Planting is delayed, and worries of famine, and worse spread. That summer, even worse news comes -- a deadly cloud of mists and fog moves north from the old territory of the Irebor Alliance.. Everything -- plants, animals, humans, everything -- dies. Betram is ill-prepared for this threat and Jane pulls the borders close, abandoning the southern marches and Addermarch. The advance of this curse terrifies the population, and this is, in part, what gives these years the name “the Blood Years” as many die. The deadly advance is stopped by mysterious forces [possibly involving Beryl and the Rangers]. The area south of the Mostove Hills is left uninhabitable, a barren wasteland of ash and dust, and starts being referred to as the Plaguelands. Famine, on top of plague, makes the winter of 1551-1552 one of the worst in memory, and many villages in the west are abandoned. 

  

Jane does what she can, but many in the kingdom believe that her true loyalties are more closely aligned with Tollen than her own kingdom -- what food there is to spare from the lowlands is often sold to Tollen instead of the highlands, and muttering can be heard in the Aine Hills and further north, of how Jane is not a true Sembaran.

  

Bertram I dies this winter, and his nephew, Bertram II (Derik III’s eldest grandson) takes the throne, a boy of 15. Born only two years after his uncle they were raised together as brothers, and Jane was like a surrogate mother to Bertram II. Reginald (Bertram II’s father) was a dashing lord and chief military advisor to his father. He spent much of his life on military campaigns and had little patience for court. His wife was a skilled knight as well, and spent much of her time on campaigns with Reginald. This left Jane to largely raise their children, and Bertam II grew up alongside Bertram I.

  

Bertram II began his reign in sorrow for his uncle, and never really found his footing. A handsome teenager, convinced of his own immortality and believing himself the equal of his grandfather, he believed he could right the wrongs of the kingdom himself. Jane, still powerful, was his regent for a year, and maintained the loyalty of the five major dukes until her death in 1559.

  

In 1558, forces of hobgoblins and allies attempt a crossing of the ~CentralMountains~ north of the devastation of Ulrich Monastery, as the Chardonian offensive in the west begins to put pressure on hobgoblin encampments. Still recovering from famine and plague, and still maintaining strong garrisons along the Enst, Jane councils strongly against Sembara joining this war. The highland kingdoms raise their banners anyway, and join together with the dwarves in a great alliance, which, after a series of early setbacks, decisively defeats the threat in 1561.

  

Bertram II, after his step-grandmother’s death in 1559, gathers a small force of knights, and without the backing of the Royal Council or any great thought to supply chains, logistics, or military strategy, rides north to aid the barons of Lavnoch and Ardlas against the hobgoblins. He dies in battle in the deadly winter of 1560, when the tide of battle is turned but great losses were suffered. In early March, 1561, word of Bertram’s death reaches Embry, and Arryn I is proclaimed king.

  

Arryn was the second son, and a quiet, scholarly man, overshadowed by his strong willed sisters, Elaine and Anne. He spent much of his reign fascinated by the stars, and soon after rising to the kingship, proclaimed the heavens did not wish him to bear an heir. This announcement shook the royal court. The tension between Anne and Elaine was always strong. From birth, they were extremely close but also extremely competitive, extremely smart, and unable to see a way to share power or the throne. Anne and Elaine, however, as the third and fourth daughters of Reginald, had always been expected to be important duchesses, members of the Royal Council, but never in direct competition for the control of the throne.

  

The next few years were a time of factionalism. Arryn retreated to his study of the heavens, largely ignoring the affairs of state. The barons of the highlands came to council less and less, and in the third year of his reign (DR 1563) the barons of Zovcka refuse Arryn’s summons, and meet instead at the small trade town of Doka, and proclaim Mila, Baroness of the Upper Volta as Queen of Zovcka. Little is done in Embry, as Arryn proclaims the stars had foretold this. Anne, by now the young wife of the heir to the Duchess of Telham, argues for war, but Arryn refuses to call his knights, and little comes of it.

  

1564 is a golden year of fine harvests, and peace throughout the kingdom. For the first time in living memory, no hobgoblins came over the mountains, no beasts rode north from the Plaguelands. Arryn, however, is increasingly distracted and sickly, spending much of his time searching the stars. He leaves the management of his kingdom to his Royal Council, which is increasingly divided into two hardening factions: Anne, backed by the Duchy of Telham and many of the small baronies in the highlands (at least those that were not turning their backs on Sembara), and Elaine, backed by the major dukes of the heartland, as well as the western and southern marches. 

  

In 1565, Arryn announces he will depart on a Grand Ambassadorship to Tollen, Cymea, and Tyrwingha. Few believe it is wise for him to leave the kingdom for many months, but he will not be dissuaded. In his absence, he appoints his father’s cousin, Wisym as regent. Wisym is a diplomat and peace-maker, and spends much of his brief regency treating with the barons of Ardlas, Breva, and Lavnoch, as well as their dwarven neighbors.

  

Arryn returns to the capital in 1566, a changed man - whereas before he was evenhanded in dealing with his sisters, on his return he clearly favors Elaine, and rumors spread that he has plans to name her his sole heir. He also returns with an offer of marriage to Elaine from the King of Tyrwingha. She accepts, and without forsaking her rights to the Sembara throne, retreats to live in Tyrwingha.

  

In DR 1567, Arryn dies, unexpectedly, in an accidental fall from a tower. Elaine immediately marches north, stopping at every castle and barony in the borderlands and the west, and the Duchies of Wisford, Chemin, and Sembara. She marches down the Semb and encamps five hundred knights outside the walls of Embry as winter falls. Anne does not retreat from this show of force. With the support of the Duchies of Arnsbury, Telham and Seham, and many of the highland barons, she marches her own army to the gates of Embry.

  

The winter passes slowly. Food is scare, and although no battles are fought, several skirmishes almost break out into a full blown battle. As 1568 dawns, it seemed to all that a battle would break out. Elaine and Anne were no longer speaking to each other. The first to leave were the barons of the highlands. As the capital emptied over fears of errupting violence, a compromise was reached. The halflings (or maybe lizardfolk?) negotiated an agreement: Anne would withdraw to Telham, Elaine to Tyrwingha, and Wisym would take the throne. 

  

Wisym was crowned king Wisym I in the summer of 1568. However, following the lead of Zovcka, Ardlas, Breva, and Lavnoch refused to acknowledge this compromise. Anne, with stronger ties to the Volta river valley, was proclaimed Queen of Breva, and Ardlas and Lavnoch proclaimed their own rulers. 

  

Elaine never lost her allies in Sembara, and often visited her younger brother Gyles, installed as the Duke of Sembara, and his household. Anne, more bitter at having had to agree to a compromise, spent fewer and fewer summers at the royal court, and increasingly withdrew into herself. She came to believe that she was cheated of the throne and spent more and more time researching amongst the libraries in Tollen for a simple solution (say, a charm to force her sister to acknowledge her as the rightful queen). Anne even travelled to Chardon, and gathered a small group of wizards around her.

  

Wisym spent two summers (in 1572 and 1573) campaigning in the highlands, but with little success. The highland kingdoms refused to be drawn back into the Sembara orbit. In 1574, a major force of hobgoblins probed the northern defenses, and were pushed back by the same  dwarven/highland alliance in 1561 that decisively defeated the hobgoblins, and that had now fortified the northern passes against further incursions through an alliance with the stoneborn and dwarves.

  

The next year, in DR 1575, a Sembara unprepared for a major attack was assaulted on the western front by a mass organized army of hobgoblins, seemingly allied with a darker horror. Rumors sped west from the battlefields of ~something about mind flayers~. The hobgoblins overran much of the west and south, and were stopped from overrunning all of Sembara only by great sacrifice. The next 8 years of the Hobgoblin Wars were the bloodiest in Sembara history since the Great War. Although the conflict ebbed and flowed, peace never lasted long, until, after 1580, it seemed that the ferocious ~mind flayer allies~ were defeated. 

  

In 1583, with the Marches of Enford and much of the land south of the Enst still under hobgoblin control, Wisym I dies. 

  

Ultimately, on Wisym’s death, Anne attempted to control Elaine’s mind with a powerful spell, and force her to give up any claim to the throne. When this failed, and the attempt came out, the populace and nobility turned on Anne, and Elaine was the undisputed queen.

  

Anne was executed for treason, although her children were allowed to live in exile and settled in Tollen for the most part, although her youngest son is said to have journeyed the long distance to Chardon.

  

In the first summer of her reign, in 1584, Elaine launches a major offensive against the hobgoblins in the west, but is defeated. Fearing for the rest of the kingdom, but unwilling to let her people suffer under the hobgoblin rule, she raises a large tax, to hire a force of mercenaries from the east and retake her kingdom.

  

But before her army can come together, in  DR 1585, magic goes wrong. Starting in the Tyrwinghan marches, rangers and others exploring in the Plaguelands notice that fires radiate cold, not heat, and the days get progressively colder as the sun rises, warming again at night. Cooking is impossible, and plants begin to freeze and die. The effect seems to spread along ley lines, out of the Plaguelands, and eventually begins to move into settled areas of Tyrwingha, reaching as far as the River Ernst and the eastern parts of Addermarch (but sparing the Tyrwinghan capitol, thankfully). People panic and flee, but many die in the great famines this causes before an expedition into the Plaguelands heals the land. Many believe this is divine retribution for Anne’s magic, and this strengthens a general distrust of arcane magic in Sembara. 

  

The army vanishes amongst this, and the next year (1586) Elaine dies. Many say she died of grief for her lost sister, but others believe she died from a curse her sister placed on her.

  

The Western Reconquest, DR 1590 - DR 1599: The final conflict of the Blood Years. As Cece comes to power, she begins a long campaign to reclaim the lost territory of the western marches. Over the course of several campaigns, the western marches are freed and fortified, a wall is constructed between the Wistel and the Ernst, and the XXXX territory west of the wall is lain to waste. These campaigns strengthen the alliance between Sembara and the southern marches, and rebuild good relations with the dwarves, ushering in 50 years of peace and prosperity. 

### The Peace of Cece

Cece I reigned for 60 years, the longest reign in the annuals of the kings and queens of Sembara. Her reign was one of peace, prosperity, and recovery. Sembara finally began to climb out of the devastation of the Great Wars and the Blood Years, and for the first time in five generations the future of Sembara seemed to be brighter than its past. 

  

If one thing marred her reign, it was her children. Her eldest drowned on a trade mission to Cymea. Her second child perished in a great fire, when one of the crown holdings burnt to the ground. Her third child died on the western marches, when her vanguard was ambushed by ogres, in the final battle of the Western War. Her fifth child perished as a child, from an incurable disease that even the prayers of the clerics could  not prevent. Her sixth child died in childbirth.

  

Only her fourth child, Robert, survived to take the throne.

  

#### The Crisis of Malach

Robert took the throne late in life, but was a steadfast ruler dedicated to continuing the success of his mother. 

  

However, in the year 7 Robert I (1653 DE), bad luck started to spread over the land. The western marches were overrun twice. Misunderstands with ~SouthernMarcherKingdom~ caused problems. Conflict flared up with ~HighlandKingdom~. etc. 

  

Then in the year 1656 DE, a band of heroes discovered the Robert I had in fact been dead for 3 years, and a lich king ruling in his stead. Many of Robert’s children, nephews, and nieces had been killed, and replaced with grisly undead servants, disguised as themselves.

  

The lich was defeated, and Elaine II restored to the throne.

### The Current Day

Elaine II has taken the throne at a time of uncertainty but also hope. Many look to her to bring back the days of Cece

## Life in the Kingdom of Sembara and Tyrwingha

### (NOTES) Political Organization of Sembara

  

The world of Taelgar is a dangerous place, and much of society is organized around protection of the land from hobgoblins, orcs, and other worse things. Settlements are vulnerable to raids and other dangers, and so isolated hamlets without a manor or any other form of protection are rare.

  

Nobility and Titles

The mainstay of the Sembaran feudal organization is the baron. Barons are the ‘tenants-in-chief’ and the councils and vassals of the great lords (the king and the dukes). The barons are the lowest level of the peerage, and have a responsibility to attend the sovereign in council when summoned (a rare event). There are about three dozen barons in the kingdom.

  

Beneath the barons are the great body of lords of the manor: the primary lords most people interact with. Although not members of the peerage, they are the primary vassals in the feudal system and manage much of the day to day government.

  

In between the barons and the monarch are two other noble titles:

- Dukes are the rulers of the six historic duchies (Sembara, Seham, Telham, Chemin, Wisford, and Arnsbury) and within their duchies exercise some of the powers of the monarch, although they are still clearly subservient to the monarch. But they are the most important and highest ranked nobles
    
- Earl is a title imported from Tyrwingha, used to denote a high ranking noble but lower in rank than a duke. Earls usually have barons as their vassals, like dukes, and are an important part of the monarch’s council, like dukes, but are beneath a duke in rank. 
    

  

However, the general feudal relationships always go: Lord is the vassal of a baron who is the vassal of either an earl, a duke, or the king. Earls and dukes are vassals of the king.

  

That is, the fact that earls are beneath dukes in the hierarchy does not imply that earls are vassals of dukes.

  

The nobles -- barons, dukes, and earls -- have specific obligations to the monarch around giving council and attending certain key events [ still to be worked out ].

  


Bounty

The crown of Sembara maintains a bounty on ‘dark’ creatures, including hobgoblins, orcs, dark fey, undead, etc, administered through the lords of the manor or military garrisons, but funded via the crown. This bounty is not paid to soldiers in times of war, but in other times ‘monster slaying’ can be profitable. This is a mostly forgotten tradition in the heartlands, but significant sums of silver and gold are paid to adventurers on the borders.

  

By law, the bounty is only payable on evil creatures slain within 50 miles of the borders, but in practice this is rarely enforced. The bounty is payable to all comers, but does require proof, and thus hard to pay out for some creatures (undead, outer planes folks, elementals, etc).

  

Treasure, Plunder, and Salvage

The history of Taelgar has left behind treasure in many places, and Sembara has a rich and complex law of salvage and treasure seeking, which boils down to: finders keepers, unless you are in settled and cultivated land, in which case the property owner is due 40% (usually the local lord, unless it is a freehold property, and always the local lord in common lands) and the crown 10%. There is rich case law on what ‘settled and cultivated’ land means.

  

This only applies to a treasure horde, which is defined as “an ancient deposit of money, jewels, or magic for whom no owner is known”. In practice, well-armed adventurers or treasure seekers on the edges of the ‘safe’ world simply ignore this law, and it is really only applied to the odd peasant who accidentally digs up a cache of Drankorian silver while hoeing their garden.

  

Treasure taken from a monster, goblinoid, orc, or similar is considered plunder (same with treasure taken from bandits). Plunder is technically the property of whomever it was taken from, for a year, after which it is considered abandoned and may be kept by the finder. The recoverer of the treasure is due a right of salvage, however, of 60% of the value of the treasure, if they risked bodily harm to recover it. In practice, this law is usually more ignored than followed, unless it is very obvious who owns the property (a goblin raiding party is killed two miles outside of the town they raided, before they made it back to their lair, or whatever).

  

Functions of Government

The major functions of government are defense, road building and maintenance, management of justice, foreign relations, and maintenance of the crown messengers. 

  

The monarch supplies the army, and is the source of justice, and controls foreign relations. The dukes are responsible for maintaining roads and building defenses within their duchies. The monarch can impose a ducal tax on the duchies specifically for specific purposes, i.e. to build castles on the western march or other frontiers that are not part of duchies.

  

Feudal Organization

The lord of the manor is the vassal of a baron, who is the vassal of either a duke or the crown. The dukes are vassals of the crown as well.

  

So the direct vassals of the crown are the six dukes (Telham, Seham, Wisford, Chemin, Sembara, and Arnsbury) as well as about two dozen barons in the highlands, northlands, and marches. 

  

Another forty or so barons are the vassals of the six dukes, and therefore not the direct vassals of the crown. 

  

Beneath the barons are a few thousand lords, responsible for a single manor each.

  

Historically the barons owed the king military service with a number of knights related to the size of their land. But during the reign of Derik III this was reorganized along the lines of a professional military and the baronial tax. Today the military is professionally organized and controlled by the king.

  

Some manors are controlled by castellans or stewards, rather than lords. These are typical in cases when the land is part of a baronial, ducal, or royal demense. 

  

Military Organization

The defense of the realm and the people within it is a key concern of the nobility and the lords of the manor. The defenses of the realm are broadly organized in two ways:

- The lord of the manor is obligated to maintain defenses for their village or town. The deca (the tenth of the harvest tax due annually) is dedicated to this purpose
    
- The monarchy maintains a professional fighting force of about 7,000 soldiers, divided into three armies: the Army of the West, the Army of South, and the Army of the North, plus a small navy of about 20 vessels
    

  

The Army of the West numbers 4,000 soldiers, divided into a North Watch, Center Watch, and South Watch. The South Watch is the largest at 1,600 soldiers; the North and Center Watches are 1,200 soldiers each. Each watch is in turn divided into two companies, for a total of six companies.

  

The Army of the North is 1,500 soldiers divided into two companies, one garrisoned near Arnsbury and the other along the northern Volta. Historically this army was much larger, but today the northern border is peaceful and few threats come south from Vostok.

  

The Army of the South is also 1,500 soldiers, divided into four companies -- three are garrisoned in Tyrwingha, and the fourth along the Enst at Fellburn.

  

These armies are professional, well-equipped, and well-trained and can be brought together into a large fighting force when a serious threat emerges on the border.  In addition to the major garrisons, a number of border castles and fortifications (including the ~UlrichWall~) are staffed by the military, mostly in the west.

  

Within the army, the Army of the West is often seen as the ‘real’ army, and usually has significant skirmishes every year. The armies of the North and South are where the second children of barons go to have an honorable career with just the right amount of risk.

  

The Army of the West guards the western borders, and is significant in Dunfry, Ainwick, and the Marches of Enford, including responsibility for the occasional patrol of the largely uninhabited border along the Enst. The farthest garrison east is in Clenseau, which although technically in the Barony of Aveil, is just on the border of the two baronies and a bit of a melting pot town.

  

East of Clenseau, the local lords of Varbonne, Aveil, and the other baronies of the borderlands are largely left to their own devices, unless a threat so great appears that the Army of the South must ride from Fellburn. But the Plaguelands are largely seen as empty, cursed lands, and no major threat has marched from their in living memory.

  

In the south, north, and along the Volta, however, the bulk of the defenses of the border are left to the local lords. Additionally, not all threats emerge at borders -- which are after all, mostly uninhabited land. The lords of even the heartland manors are responsible for maintaining a stout manor house that can provide shelter at need, and a wall (if possible and reasonable, this depends greatly on the size of the population). Additionally, the lords of the manor are expected to maintain a reasonable guard, usually a half dozen part-time men-at-arms, but in some border towns, a more respectable troop of two dozen or more professionals. 

  

Within free cities (see below) the city government has similar responsibilities as the lord of the manor.

  

In order to support border defenses, the military commanders pay an annual sum to certain border lords -- barons, lords of the manor, or earls, as the commander sees fit -- to help them maintain and organize defenses. These payments can be a key source of patronage, and the twelve company commanders, three watch commanders, and three army commanders are significant and powerful civil servants.

  
  

Free Cities

Many of the cities and some market towns are ‘free’ cities, meaning that they have a specific charter from the king and are free of a lord. The variety of these charters are large, but generally define the form of government of the city (a lord mayor, a council, guilds, etc) and an annual tax due in lieu of the baronial taxes, the deca, and the nonem. The city is responsible for collecting the hearth tax and remitting it to the crown directly. 

  

Village Organization

The heart of Sembaran life for most of the inhabitants of the kingdom is the village. Villages range in size from a hamlet of two dozen houses, home to 50 or 60 souls, and bustling agricultural centers of almost a thousand people. Any larger than this and the culture of the place starts to change, as the inhabitants are more market participants than farmers (see cities above and towns, below).

  

The most common village is about 250 or 300 people, living in about 50 or 60 houses clustered along a haphazard street or two. All villages, no matter how small, have a temple to the community Divine, and most villages are the site of the lord’s manor (although in some cases, a lord may hold multiple villages and only have a manor in one of them).

  

Within the village organization are several important roles:

  

The lord or castellan. The lord (or castellan, who serves as the standin for the lord for villages that are part of a great noble’s demense, i.e. a baronial, ducal, or royal village) is ultimately responsible for the running of the village, including: 

- Defense from outside threats and maintenance of the lord’s guard
    
- Collection of taxes and remittance of taxes to their baron

I like the idea of a strong monarchy, but I think you had mentioned some thoughts towards a constitutional monarchy, and something more like the English throne than the French throne has more appeal to me and seems to 'fit' better.

  

The basic idea I had was that in Derik I or Derik II day the basic informal arrangements were codified in a document The Charter for the Organization of the Royal Council and the King's Court which is usually just referred to as The Charter and forms the written rules of the kingdom. It outlines the line of succession, the makeup up the Royal Council, the powers, duties, and revenue due to the crown. 

  

I imagine the charter has been modified at times over the years, and by 1657, the council would consist of:

- * The king/queen
    
- * The dukes of the 6 great duchies (the five duchies of the heartland region, plus the duchy of Telham along the northland coast - note that Sembara is one of the duchies, and said duchy has always been held by the king -- so the king has an extra seat here)
    
- * Some noble representative from the western marches
    
- * Five royal ministers, appointed by the king: the chief minister, the minister of the treasurer, the minister of horse, minister of the navy, the minister of justice
    
- * Two household ministers, appointed by the king: the chamberlain and the steward
    
- * Some kind of royal / court wizard, although I haven't worked out details on how this person is appointed - but probably some kind of consensus position, not a direct appointee of the crown
    
- * Some kind of representivity of the gods (or maybe two?)
    
- * the Prince of Twingha
    
- * the keeper of the keys of Embry (a position elected by the guilds of the city) (plus maybe one or two other representatives from major cities)
    
- * five elected commoners, the speaker of the farmers, the speaker of the fishers, and the speaker of the herders. historically these actually represented these specific occupations but today they are elected from specific geographic regions. plus in modern times, two more were added -- for the marches and twingha
    

  

This would be 6 nobles, 7 kings ministers, 3 positions personally appointed by the king, and 8 or 9 wild cards. Still playing with the balance. Plus, a halfling representative. I was thinking the halflings would have been bystanders in this agreement, but acknowledged as a key stakeholder in the kingdom, but without pledging loyalty to the crown, more like honored observers. 

  

The charter would outline basically the duties of the king (defend the realm, dispense fair and even handed justice, build roads and fortifications), some checks on the war making power, the royal sources of income (customs duties, taxes on salt, levies on inheritances, rents due from certain large estates, and the power to levy a land tax with consent of the council). Some stuff about the maintenance of knights, manpower due the king, maybe some regulations on magic, and something about due process of law and the rights of people to justice.

  

Still thinking about how the crown is responsible for justice and how that plays out (very feudal, i.e. the dukes and other lords dispense justice), or are there sheriffs and other kinds of royal court systems? Not sure.

  

[From Tim:Something like the English throne works fine for me. My sense is that the Sembaran monarchy is a fairly secular one, in the scheme of things (in contrast to some other places, such as pre-Great War Dunmar, where the ruler was literally chosen by real gods). Of course they acknowledge the gods, and magic plays a role, but more so than many other places, Sembara is a kingdom that trusts in the military might of its rulers and knights. E.g. if Sembara were a D&D class, would be a fighter, whereas Chardon would be a wizard, Tyrwingha would be a warlock, and Dunmar would be a paladin. This attitude would be strengthened by the events you made up with the history of the royal family, and the occasional curses/wild magic that comes from the Plaguelands, making people think magic is dangerous and risky, and the gods won't intervene to protect you (although of course sometimes they do - but Sembaran nobility is not particularly god blessed). So I think a relatively cursory role for court wizard and high priest on the council makes sense. 

  

I like Derik I codifying a charter, in part as a unifying step that binds the duchies of the heartlands, the southern marches, the northlands, Tyrwingha, and the highlands together. Perhaps towards the end of his reign. I think Vostok would have been conquered in Derik II's reign, and never a solid part of the kingdom. 

  

As far as the exact composition of the council, I'm pretty agnostic. I did make up a similar council scheme for Addermarch under Earl Eofric, consisting of the Earl, a 'court wizard' type referred to as the master/mistress of letters, a spymaster who was also associated with the Rangers, the Earl's chamberlain/personal secretary who also served as the master of arms, and a priest who also served as the master of law. Part of this was compression of roles for gaming purposes, since introducing more than a handful of NPCs in a council scene is confusing and hard to follow. But the basic idea of a royal council with some (but limited) real power, that includes some independent voices not controlled by the king, fits well with this design. And of course this is Addermarch, which is much smaller than Sembara writ large (and at this stage, a marcher duchy owing allegiance to the royal crown). My inclination would be that the exact composition of the council is not necessarily specified by the charter, and so changes over time. Perhaps charter specifies that the six great duchies, the gods, the Prince of Tyrwingha, the keeper of the keys of Embry, a voice of the magi, and a voice of the people are represented, but leaves the details a bit up in the air, and doesn't give a limit to the council size. 

  

As far as justice -- in Addermarch, justice is very feudal, dispensed by the lords of the manor in local villages, and ultimately Earl Eofric in his person. But it would certainly make sense that a more elaborate system of courts and sheriffs would have developed in the settled river valleys, even if feudal justice was still the norm in the marches in 1748. 

  

About halflings. I would not give halflings a seat on the council. Rather, I would make it so that one particular halfling family (which changes at a regular time interval, but always put forth by the halfling community and not the humans of Sembara) is given a title like Royal Observer, or something like that, and one member of that family is allowed to attend any meeting of the council, and speak for halfling concerns at the council, but does not have a vote. Something like that. Basically, someone the halflings can choose is always allowed to watch and listen and speak, but as the laws of Sembara do not bind halflings (at least those who have not sworn allegiance to the king), this individual is not allowed to vote at the council. I think there would also be long standing treaties / understandings, dating back to Drankor, regarding free movement of halflings, and perhaps more recent treaties on the rights of the little people in the Kingdom. Of all the Elder races, halflings would be most involved in human affairs -- lizard folk would not care, as they would tend to live in their own enclaves subject to their own laws (but this could be an interesting plot point, as some Sembaran cities and towns may have a nearby lizardfolk enclave where Sembaran laws have no force), and dwarves, although often settling in communities in human cities, tend strongly enough towards lawful that they would likely swear joint allegiance to the human lords of their community, excepting only the case where their preexisting duties to clan and caste conflict. ]

### Justice and the Law

  

In general, the Sembaran legal code is based on ancient tradition, precedent, and case law more than a strict legal code (English common law, not Roman legal codes is the real world analogy). Additionally, there is an ancient tradition in the region that fundamentally, the law is an agreement between people on how to live, not something that flows from the king. The king may be granted extraordinary powers because of his extraordinary importance, but the king (and dukes and barons and lords) are subject to the law just like other people. 

  

This leads to a strong belief that new laws cannot just be ‘created’, but have to be accepted by the people, usually in the form of the barons, who are seen to ‘speak for’ their baronies. This in turn leads to a strong sense that one of the duties of nobility (barons and lords) is to see that the law is enforced.

  

There are three court systems in Sembara. The royal court is responsible for adjudicating all crimes where a noble is the accused. The baronial court is responsible for adjudicating the major felonies within the barony: murder, rape, arson, treason, blasphemy, misuse of magic, counterfeiting, and robbery, or bulgary, as well as any crime for which a lord is the accused. The manorial court is responsible for adjudicating all other crimes. 

  
  

(old notes)

Justice and Law

- A city either is a free city or a manorial city/town. A manorial town is under the legal jurisdiction of a baron or duke; a free city is free and can set its own laws subject only to the terms of its founding charter and the king
    
- Within manorial estates, villages, towns, etc the baron is responsible for appointing magistrates and sheriffs. Sometimes these are all directly loyal to the baron or duke. Othertimes, the baron will delegate the next level of the nobility, who in turn may appoint themselves magistrate, or find someone.
    
- Magistrates are judges and responsible for sentencing of crimes once someone is found guilty. They also run trials and have a lot of ability to influence the jury. Technically they have a duty to be fair minded, but there is little recourse if they are not. The only appeal is to the baron and/or duke and/or king. 
    
- Sheriffs are more like cops - they are the folks who would be expected to find the murderer and/or arrest someone, and usually act as the “prosecutors”. Ultimately they are the ones putting someone forth and saying they committed a crime (although often the victim will be involved as well). 
    
- Guilt or innocence is determined by juries, usually selected by the magistrate, but the accused has some rights here as well. A majority is required to convict, but the specific rules vary by region and also the magistrate has some leeway around jury size and the specifics
    
- Accusations against the nobility are judged by a special court, either the baronial court or the royal court, depending on who the noble is. 
    
- Most punishments are quick - public humiliation, fines, flogging or other physical punishment, up to and including, for some crimes, death. Fines are big though and a key way the whole system is funded. The fines are usually due back to the baron, although the baron can delegate those to his lords as well.
    
- Halflings and dwarves are judged by the same system when the crime is against a human, except that half the jury must be of the same race as the accused. If the victim is a dwarf or a halfling and the accused is, the local dwarf or halfling community is allowed to do whatever and this system stays out unless invited
    
- Punishment for crimes against halflings or dwarfs is usually up to the local halfling or dwarf community but technically that is the magistrates decision
    
- Lizard folk are formally separate from this system. Any crime against a lizard folk is tried by the lizard folk although the sheriff will help as requested
    
- Any time a lizard folk is accused of a crime permission is required to try them. If the lizard folk community rejects the evidence and cannot come up with an alternative criminal they must pay a weregild to the victims. 
    
- In most jurisdictions the sheriffs are not really staffed to investigate crimes. They arrest accused and support the magistrate but the victim or victims family or victims hirelings  has to do most of the legwork
    
- In some larger towns, or for certain crimes, the sheriffs will be more involved and might have a larger constabulary
    
- Like barons, free towns are largely in charge of their own justice and may have a different model - except for the bits around dwarves and halflings and lizard folk and nobles 
    
- Need to think a bit about jurisdiction- envisioning a system somewhat biased towards local victims
    

### Magic

- Arcane magic is rare; even those with the gift don’t often train; many who do train go to Tollen, or Cymea, or even Chardon
    
- The main point on magic is the scholarly study of it, and the belief that it can be understood and perfected and used as part of civil society is seen as false and wrong
    
- There is a royal system of registration for mages, but it is not used / important outside of the six heartland duchies
    
- Chief Wizard  (?)
    
- To elaborate: I think the general Sembaran attitude is to distrust magic you can learn, and especially the scholarly pursuit of magic, which basically doesn't happen inside Sembara (although perhaps a few isolated wizards take apprentices informally or something, there is no 'wizards's college' or anything). This is the Drankorian/Chardonian ideal, the probing the secrets of the planes, and I think for Sembara this would be seen as deeply suspicious. But arcane magic per se is not necessarily itself problematic, and there is definitely a (perhaps somewhat hidden) tradition of fey-tinged sorcerer that Sembarans see as more home-grown and more trustworthy. So, while a mage's council or something probably doesn't exist, and if it did exist people would be very suspicious of it, individual arcane magic users who get their powers from somewhere more acceptable could gain individual trust of their community. I think fey-themed stuff would be most common, and things like storm sorcerers or wild magic that is very much "of the land" would also potentially be welcomed. But wizards would initially arouse distrust in most places. And in some sense it might be hard to tell the difference, so anyone without an obvious source of magic would initially be distrusted, but then if people learned that you were infused with the chaotic magical energy of the land or something the suspicion wouldn't necessarily linger.
    
- One knock on effect of this is that magic items are rare and usually hard or impossible to buy (in contrast to Chardon, for example), excepting things like potions of healing that probably arise from clerics/temples.

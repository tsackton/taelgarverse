Some notes from email -- maybe not perfect
**Elves - Social Structure**

- Elven social structure is strongly organized around the _ka_ and the cycle of the generations. In general, elven life is divided up into a two phases:

- The eighty years or so when children are being born and raised (_mela_)
- The eighty years or so when all of the youngest _ka_ is out in the world, or in other elven kingdoms, before they start to return (_leya_)
- So for example the 36th ka was born mostly between 1465 and 1495 DR and reached adulthood between 1515 and 1545. 

- The 36th ka didn’t start bearing children until 1625 - 1655
- So from 1545 until 1625 the youngest generation was in some sense absent
- And in the current day, the children of the 37th ka are all grown (the youngest having left home around 1705), but no one has returned to begin the 38th ka

- WIthin elven society there are three important roles

- The "nurturer", who watches over the young and the homeland
- The "caretaker", who watches over the elder races (essentially in charge of foreign policy)
- The "unifier", who mediates disputes

- These roles are not necessarily single individuals, and in fact how these roles are filled changes between elven lands and over time, and the roles are usually filled differently during the _mela_ from the _leya_. If the generation just born is the current _ka_ (i.e. the kids, call it X _ka_), then:

- During the _mela_, the _ka_ X-1 are the nurturers and X-2 are the caretakers. During the _leya_, however, the roles switch and X-1 are the caretakers and X-2 are the nurturers. Then X comes home, and becomes the _mela._
- So an elf born in _ka_ 35 will have no role for their first 150 years of life, and then be part of the nurturers for 80 years, as they have children, then caretakers for the next 160 years, the nurturers for a final 80 years
- The idea is that a parent will be the nurturer for their child's early years, a caretaker when their children are out in the world, a caretaker again when their grandchildren are being born, and finally a nurturer when their grandchildren are out in the world
- The unifier is always filled by the elder _ka,_ which are defined as those at least 4 generations removed from childbearing (i.e. if the current ka is 36, from the 32rd ka or before)

- Elves have no rulers per se, although humans and other races often see the caretakers are rulers, as they are the "outward" face of elves and often speak with authority - but an elf in general doesn't recognize any particular king or lord has having authority over them, save the gods
- The unifiers are responsible for the Trial of Unity, used when significant decisions are needed, and for the ritual and worship of the gods
- Each _ka_ decides how to fulfill its role and responsibility - although the unifiers are always an even number, always divine magic users, always from the same ka, and always dedicated half to Aldonar and half to Elmerca. Selecting a new unifier is a ritualistic experience (perhaps similar to the Wisdom Trees thing from Chat GPT) that ultimately involves, similar to the Trial by Unity, a community consensus as to who to select. At times, this person gains divine magic as part of the ritual.
- Ka most commonly select small groups to act as the nurturer and caretakers, usually via debate and consensus. By random lottery, trials of merit/wisdom, voting are all possible. Importantly, the older generations have no real say or influence, i.e. there is nothing hereditary about this -- although the previous generation does help the transition -- when a new generation is becoming the nurturer the previous nurturer is 2 generations back and of course can share wisdom, experience, etc.

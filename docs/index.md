This is the "Campaign Bible" for Taelgar, a collection of notes, information, and facts about the world that have been introduced in play. 

Currently, this i almost entirely derived from my long-running [Dunmari Frontier Campaign](<campaigns/dunmari-frontier/dunmari-frontier-campaign.md>), but also includes some world lore originally developed many years ago for the adventures of [Heroes of the Great War](<people/pcs/great-war/heroes-of-the-great-war.md>), as well as lore from the [Mawar Adventures](<campaigns/mawar-confederacy/mawar-adventures.md>), from my brother's [campaign](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/), set in the same world, and from a few [short adventures](<campaigns/labyrinths-of-the-lost/labyrinths-of-the-lost.md>). Eventually, this will grow to include world lore from other campaigns and one-shots, as I update and convert my notes. 

Over the years, we have created a lot of lore for the world of Taelgar. A good place to start is the [Player's Guide](<campaigns/player-s-guide.md>), which is a gentle introduction to the world of Taelgar, its history and gods, and the sentient species that live there.

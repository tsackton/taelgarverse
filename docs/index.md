This is the "Campaign Bible" for Taelgar, a collection of notes, information, and facts about the world that have been introduced in play. 

Currently, this is largely derived from my long-running [Dunmari Frontier Campaign](<campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/dunmari-frontier-campaign.md>). However, the stories of other campaigns and adventures, including the [Great Library Campaign](<campaigns/great-library-campaign/great-library-campaign.md>), the episodic tales of [Mawar Adventures](<campaigns/mawar-adventures/mawar-adventures.md>), and the [Addermarch Campaign](<campaigns/addermarch-campaign/addermarch-campaign.md>) are also included. Many details have also been developed for my brother's [campaign](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/), set in the same world, as well as some [short adventures](<campaigns/one-shots/labyrinths-of-the-lost/labyrinths-of-the-lost.md>).

Over the years, we have created a lot of lore for the world of Taelgar. A good place to start is the [Player's Guide](<background/player-s-guide.md>), which is a gentle introduction to the world of Taelgar, its history and gods, and the sentient species that live there.

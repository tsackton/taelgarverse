# The Rangers



The Rangers are a loose collection of wanders, warriors, scouts, and others dedicated to keeping dark things from peaceful villages, and keeping the ways between towns safe. There is no formal leadership, by many look to Johanne the Younger, of [Valarin](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/valarin.md>) for guidance. Small groups, or individual Rangers, are often seen on the Dunmari Road, keeping it safe for trade, or scouting the edges of the Plaguelands or the [Darkwood](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/darkwood.md>) near Addermarch. Many Rangers look to Beryl - once a hero, now a constellation and demi-god, the [Fox and Hunter](<../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/fox-and-hunter.md>) - for inspiration and comfort. In the frontier, of [Maseau](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>), the Aurbez, and other places along the Plaguelands, Rangers often are the ones trying to keep the peace.

# The Northern Tribes

The northern forests, north of the Blackwater Fens and inland from the coast, were once home to many Deno'qai, before [Cha'mutte](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) established himself in Pandar. 

This area, a vast forest stretching from the sea to the mountains, was north of the elven territories, and the Deno'qai who settled here were fierce, independent, less influenced by the Elven ways, living more openly in small towns and villages.

The northern Deno'qai suffered greatly during the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and have only [recently begun](<../../../history/history-of-the-northern-deno-qai.md>) to emerge from their mountain redoubts.
### Customs

The northern Deno'qai, while practicing [Tanshi Worship](<../../../cosmology/religions/northern-folk-religions/tanshi-worship.md>) like their southern brethren, and descended from the same original settlers, are culturally distinct to a certain extent.

They wear heavy furs, and lamellar armor (scale mail), and fight with axes. Little farming would normally be possible in the high mountains, but the Ko'zula have learned some of the terraced farming tricks of the stoneborn, and grow hearty crops in the long days of the short summers.

The culture depends far more on hunting than the southern Deno'qai, and mammoth hunts are major events that can feed a village for a long time. For hunting, they use long barbed javelins and bows.

Share more in common with Stoneborn really than with elves up here. Very strong individualistic streak, but also the idea that you do what is good for the community or you leave.

Each village sends a representative to the yearly gathering of the tribe, to negotiate among villages and otherwise keep the peace, etc.

Tradition of marriage outside your village, but no formalized rules for which partner moves - but this keeps connections among what would otherwise be largely isolated small villages. Villages each need a lot of territory as they depend on the hunt. Manage game populations for productivity, ride reindeer not horses (and sometimes giant mountain goats).

# The Order of the Awakened Soul

The mystery cult dedicated to the Dunmari god [Bhishma](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/bhishma.md>). Dedicated to collecting the stories of the Dunmari and secondarily making sure the souls of the dead are not forgotten and lost. 

Mostly vanished.

> 
> [Kenzo](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) spoke with [Pava](<../../people/dunmari/pava.md>) to ask him what he knew of the Order of the Awakened Soul. During this conversation, he learned the following:
> 
> - The Order of the Awakened Soul was the pre-[Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) name of the Mystai of [Bhishma](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/bhishma.md>). When the order was founded in the years after [Bhishma](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/bhishma.md>) passed on from the mortal world and took up residence in the land of the gods, their mission was to tend to the soul of [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), and especially to see that the stories of the people of [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) were remembered, as [Bhishma](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/bhishma.md>) saw the people of the land as the heart and soul of the country. 
> - Since the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), that name has fallen out of use, as the Mystai turned their focus to the dead, and from “awakening the soul of the country” to putting lost spirits to peaceful sleep.
> - The order is now all but dead, and few remember the time before the events 30 years ago during which many of the strongest of the Mystai died in an attempt at something, some ritual to cleanse the land. [Pava](<../../people/dunmari/pava.md>) and [Avaras](<../../people/dunmari/avaras.md>) were still wanderers then, not yet promoted to masters.
> - The only master that [Pava](<../../people/dunmari/pava.md>) can think of who may still remember the times before is [Saka](<../../people/dunmari/saka.md>), an old woman who was a master before the attempted ritual but chose not to participate. He has not seen her in five years or more, but she always said that when she got too old to travel she was going to settle in the lands north and west of [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), among the horse herders on the plains. So perhaps she is still there.
> - The Mystai of [Bhishma](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/bhishma.md>) are now few and far between. They do gather every few years for the Feast of [Bhishma](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/bhishma.md>), but [Pava](<../../people/dunmari/pava.md>) and [Avaras](<../../people/dunmari/avaras.md>) did not attend the last gathering and don’t expect to make long journeys from their home anymore.

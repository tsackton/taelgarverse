# The Dunmari Mystery Cults



The Dunmari mystery cults are magical, semi-secret organizations dedicated to the worship and service of the divinities of the [Five Siblings](<../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>) faith. While the existence of mystery cults is well known, the exact magic and practices of each cult is generally kept secret. These organizations exist somewhat outside the normal religious hierarchy of [Dunmari religious practice](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md#religion>), and initiates of these mystery cults, known as mystai, are usually treated with respect and admiration by the [Dunmari](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>). 

While most Dunmari typically assume there are mystery cults associated with all the gods and demi-gods of the [Five Siblings](<../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>), only three are widely known and common across Dunmar:
- The [Aagir Mystai](<./aagir-mystai.md>), known as the Aagiri, patrol the roads of Dunmar and keep the land safe by might of arms. They have no fixed home, at least not any that is widely known, but their history tells of a time when they maintained and patrolled a series of fortifications along the edges of the [Desolation of Cha'mutte](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/desolation-of-cha-mutte.md>), guarding against the dangers of the ruined city of [Drankor](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>). 
- The [Sonkar Mystai](<./sonkar-mystai.md>), who can see the truth of things and are often called to resolve disputes of justice. 
- The [Lakan Mystai](<./lakan-mystai.md>), who keep the secrets of Dunmari history, and also study the secrets of metaphysics and the multiverse. They are based at an [ancient monastery](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/lakan-monastery.md>) on the outskirts of [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), although they have a presence elsewhere as well. 

Tales and rumors spread of other mystery cults, whose members often keep their identity as a mystai secret, or otherwise are rarely seen:
- The [Shakun Mystai](<./shakun-mystai.md>), based at the [Temple of Shakun](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/temple-of-shakun.md>) in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), who magically defend the eastern borders of the [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>).
- The [Bhishma Mystai](<./order-of-the-awakened-soul.md>), known as the Order of the Awakened Soul, who preserve the stories of the Dunmari people. Once, they were based at a [large temple complex](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/monastery-of-bhishma.md>) south of [Kharsan](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>), but this is now abandoned. 

Rumors tell that the Chidya Mystai can turn into animals, and that the Jeevali Mystai know the secrets of life and death and resurrection, but like many rumors it is not clear if these are true or not. Whether the demigod Adra, whose domain is secrets and outcasts, has a mystery cult, none will speculate.

   :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } A chalyte oligarch family  
    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Based in [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>), [Greater Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/greater-chardon.md>)

The Caloren family is one of the four oligarch families that control the [Chardonian chalyte trade](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/politics-of-chalyte-chardonian-empire.md>). Historically, the Caloren family has been a minor player in the chalyte trade, controlling maybe 15% of the profits and serving as a close ally and partner to the [Auratan Family](<./auratan-family.md>). More recently, they have drifted apart as the Caloren family, driven by a desire to increase profits at any cost.

# Sibyl's Hall

Sybil's Hall is a lectum, one of the undergraduate organizations that make up the [University of Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/university-of-chardon.md>). It is one of the oldest lecti of the University, founded in DR 981. Historically, Sibyl's Hall was among the most powerful and well-funded lecti, supported by a variety of religious patrons in the name of [The Sibyl](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-sibyl.md>). Since the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), Sibyl's Hall has seen its fortunes decline, and it is now heavily dependent on undergraduate tuition for support. 

Sibyl's Hall occupies a prime location in the center of the University, controlling a small quadrangle with a central yard, student rooms, a bar, lecture halls, a refectory, common rooms, and a temple of the Sibyl. However, most of these buildings are in poor repair, due to declining funds, and Sibyl's Hall  has seen better days.

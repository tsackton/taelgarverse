# Oracle of the Riven

The royal electors of [Tyrwingha](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>). There are six of these royal electors:

* The Oracle of the Red
* The Oracle of the Black
* The Oracle of the White
* The Oracle of the Green
* The Oracle of the Fallen
* The Unseen Oracle

[Ethlenn](<../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey-ethlenn.md>) is said to be the seventh elector, although of course it is rare for her to actually cast a vote. Traditionally, the oracles are all powerful warlocks, but in recent years this tradition has not always been maintained.

When an oracle dies, tradition holds that the [Archfey Ethlenn](<../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey-ethlenn.md>) appoints a new oracle. In living memory however, this has not happened. Instead, the remaining oracles elect a new oracle (although by what means, no one knows) and the abstention of Ethlenn is considered her assent.

# The Army of the West

The Army of the West numbers 4,000 soldiers, divided into a North Watch, Center Watch, and South Watch. The South Watch is the largest at 1,600 soldiers; the North and Center Watches are 1,200 soldiers each. Each watch is in turn divided into two regiments, for a total of six regiments. The Army of the West is commanded by General Ilsa Lemoine, and each watch is commanded by a colonel, and each regiment by a major.

Beneath the regimental level there are either companies, commanded by a captain, usually of 100 soldiers, or garrisons, also commanded  by a captain, of varying sizes.

The Army of the West guards the western borders, and is significant in Dunfry, Ainwick, and the Marches of Enford, including responsibility for the occasional patrol of the largely uninhabited border along the Enst. The farthest garrison east is in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), which although technically in the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>), is just on the border of the two baronies and a bit of a melting pot town.

The South Watch's two regiments are the Enst Regiment and the Dunfry Regiment. The Center Watch has two regiments, named just the First and Second Regiments. The North Watch has the Regiment of the Wall and the Regiment of Dunmore. 

The Enst Regiment is responsible for the garrisons along the river, as well as a major garrison in Enford, and is commanded by Major Edmund Hartwell. The Enst Regiment is 800 strong, divided into 5 garrisons and 3 companies
* The [Army Garrison of Cleenseau](<./army-garrison-of-cleenseau.md>), commanded by Captain Ida Rosfeld
* The Enford Garrison, commanded by Captain Matilda Wycliffe
* The North Fork Garrison, commanded by Captain Pierre Rochefort
* The South Fork Garrison, commanded by Captain Reginald Blackwood
* The River Garrison, commanded by Captain Ã‰lodie Dubois
* The First, Second, and Fourth Companies

The Dunfry Regiment is responsible for the southern wall, and is commanded by [Major Symone Barbet](<../../people/sembarans/symone-barbet.md>). The Dunfry Regiment is divided into 4 garrisons and 4 companies:
* The Dunfry Garrison, which guards the city of Dunfry itself
* The Dawn Watch Garrison, which guards the wall
* The Noon Watch Garrison, which guards the wall
* The Night Watch Garrison, which guards the wall
* The Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Companies

The South Watch overall is commanded by Colonel Claude Leclerc.

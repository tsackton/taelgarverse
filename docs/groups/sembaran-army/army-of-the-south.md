# The Army of the South

The Army of the South is also 400 soldiers, in a single company garrisoned at Fellburn. This army has few responsibilities, as the Earl of Addermarch and the Rangers guard the borders, for the most part. However, unlike the Army of the North, this army does see action, and its officers are not just sincures.

# The Army of the South


The Army of the South is a regiment of 400 soldiers, divided into four regiments of 80 soldiers each plus the garrison at Fellburn. Usually two regiments rotate on patrol in the [Borderlands](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/borderlands/borderlands.md>) and two are based at the garrison in Fellburn. 

Since the Undead Attacks in Sembara this army has been disbursed. The surviving troops are largely part of an informal army under the command of [Jacques Bellemont](<../../people/sembarans/jacques-bellemont.md>), the Duke of Wisford. Some question whether this is treason, but the Duke feels this is necessary to defend the [Duchy of Wisford](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>) from undead, given the failure of the Army of the South to do so.

One of the regiments is scattered across the [Borderlands](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/borderlands/borderlands.md>), although various patrols have turned up in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) and elsewhere.

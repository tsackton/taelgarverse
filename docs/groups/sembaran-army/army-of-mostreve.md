# The Army of Mostreve

The Army of Mostreve is a 1200-strong, divided into three companies, garrisoned along the [Mostreve Hills](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/mostreve-hills.md>) - the garrison of the Aben, in the headwaters of the Aben River, the garrison ofÂ Cyfarthfa closest to the capital, and the garrison of Deganwy on the borders of Addermarch. The Aben garrison sees action most years, and is a gathering spot for [The Rangers](<../the-rangers.md>).

The army is led by the fearsome eldritch knights and an elite cadre of warlocks (arcane magic is more common here than anywhere else in Greater Sembara to a significant degree). The Army was organized by [Derik I](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-i.md>) after his victories over the Dominion of Avatus, and it today provides a significant route of social mobility -- but also integration into the Sembaran nobility and upper classes, as many Sembarans serve in this army alongside the Tyrwinghan knights.

The Hardstones are a prominent dwarven clan in Tokra, primarily known for their long-standing association with the [Tokra Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>). The clan has traditionally worked at the archives, primarily as architects and generally managing the physical infrastructure of the building, settling in [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) in the years after the [Fire War](<../../events/1500s/fire-war.md>). But they are also known, at times, to work some minor runic magic to protect scrolls and mend damage.

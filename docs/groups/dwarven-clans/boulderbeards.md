   :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } A [dwarven](<../../species/dwarves.md>) clan  
</div>


The Boulderbeards are one of several founding clans of the kingdom of [Nardith](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/nardith.md>), having fled the fall of the [Ardith](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>) during the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) to start a new life in a safer place. The Boulderbeards were among the prominent clans that occupied the [Dwarven Outpost (Raven's Hold)](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dwarven-outpost-raven-s-hold.md>) before the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>).

# The Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers



A secretive guild in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), around which many rumors swirl, including that they are the oldest inhabitants of the city. The members of the guild rarely make themselves known in public. 

Rumored to trade information, especially rare and hard to acquire information, for magic items.
## Known Members

- [Delios the Sage](<../../people/tollenders/delios-the-sage.md>), an elderly scholar with a magic scroll that seems to allow querying information from some mysterious source

## Rumored Members:

People who deal with the guild often receive letters from strange sources with the information they requested, which arrive via magic. Whether the writers of the letters are aliases, members of the guild, or something stranger is not know. Rumored letter writers include.

- The Flamewarden, the writer of the letter sent to the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) concerning Frankar and the [Elemental Plane of Fire](<../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-plane-of-fire.md>)

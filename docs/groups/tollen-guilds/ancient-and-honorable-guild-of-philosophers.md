   :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } A guild in the [Free City of Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>), the Western Green Sea Region  
</div>


The Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers is a secretive guild in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>), about which many rumors swirl. The members of the guild rarely make themselves known in public, although every year elders from the guild lead the largest of the [Pyravela](<../../gods-and-religions/holidays-and-festivals/pyravela.md>) parades in Tollen. 
## Rumors

It is rumored that the Philosopher's Guild is the oldest organization in Tollen, and some even claim that the eldest of the Philosopher's are immortal, or nearly so, and are, themselves, the original inhabitants of the city. Others claim that the guildhall of the Philosopher's Guild pre-dates the founding of Tollen. Whether there is truth to these rumors is not known. 

It is common knowledge in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) that the Philosopher's Guild will exchange magic items for information, especially rare and secretive information that is difficult, or impossible, to acquire in any other way. The more powerful and unique the item given is, the better the information received, although no one has ever figured out the precise rules that govern these exchanges. 

People who deal with the guild typically receive letters, arriving by magic and from strange sources, with the information they requested. Whether the writers of these letters are aliases, members of the guild, or something stranger is not know. 


The [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) has received many of these letters, from a variety of strange names:
- The Flamewarden, the [writer of a letter](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/letters-and-notes/philosopher-s-information-concerning-frankar.md>) concerning [Frankar](<../../people/dwarves/frankar.md>) and the [Elemental Plane of Fire](<../../cosmology/energy-realms/elemental-plane-of-fire.md>)
- The Ninth Artificer, the [writer of a letter](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/letters-and-notes/philosopher-s-information-concerning-binding-stones.md>) concerning an ancient magical item know as the [Binding Stones](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/treasure/binding-stones.md>). 
- The Forgotten Chronicler, the [writer of a letter](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/letters-and-notes/philosopher-s-information-concerning-rodnya-voknaz.md>) concerning the history of the [Rodnya Voknaz](<../urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>). 
- The North Wind, the [writer of a letter](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/letters-and-notes/philosopher-s-information-concerning-ursk.md>) concerning [Ursk](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk/ursk.md>). 
- The Writhing Chaos, possibly the [writer of a letter](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/letters-and-notes/philosopher-s-information-concerning-rai-s-hand.md>) concerning the [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/treasure/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>). 

## Guildhall

The Ancient and Honorable Order of Philosophers maintains a guild hall in [Skepwalk](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/skepwalk.md>), the oldest part of the city of [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>). Although Skepwalk is mostly known for narrow streets and the bustling fish markets, the guild hall of the Philosopher's Guild is an oasis of calm and quiet, where the din of the streets seems to fade into nothingness as soon as you cross into the strangely out-of-season garden on the guildhall grounds. Visitors are welcome to the grounds and the tea rooms of the guildhall, but no further, and no one outside the Philosopher's Guild knows what occupies the majority of the guildhall building itself.  
## Known Members

   :material-calendar: Destroyed in battle on January 20th, 1749  
</div>


The [orc](<../../species/orcs.md>) horde commanded by [Grash](<../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>), based out of [Kharsan](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>). This horde formed in the summer of DR 1747, as [Grash](<../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) began gathering the various scattered minor groups of [orcs](<../../species/orcs.md>) that had been scratching out a living in the marginal lands of the [Nashtkar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>). 

These [orcs](<../../species/orcs.md>) worship [Grash](<../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) as a demigod of [Thark](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>), and most believe fully that [Grash](<../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) has granted them freedom from death as long as they fight for his cause. 

This horde began constructing a fortified warren a few miles south of [Kharsan](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) in early DR 1748, and marched to war under [Grash](<../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>)'s leadership against the [People of the Rainbow](<./people-of-the-rainbow.md>) based in [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/upper-istaros/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) in December 1748, during the [War of the Cloak](<../../events/1700s/war-of-the-cloak.md>).

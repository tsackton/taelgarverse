# The People of the Rainbow

The name for the orcs of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) who have lived free from [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s curse for many generations.
## History

The People of the Rainbow trace their origins to the Golden Age of the [Drankorian Empire](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), when their ancestors were freed from [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s chains by the gift of an archfey known as the [Cloudspinner](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>). In those days, the People of the Rainbow grew and prospered in the feywild domain of [Amberglow](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), under the [Cloudspinner](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>)'s protection, and safe from [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s reach. 

As they grew, the People of the Rainbow wished to free their brethren from [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s chains, so with the [Cloudspinner](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cloudspinner.md>)'s blessing and the gift of the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) to protect them, they ventured back to the material plane. 

However, rumors of the unchained orcs and the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) and its power grew in [Drankor](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), and eventually attracted the attention of [Apollyon](<../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), the emperor, who attacked the People of the Rainbow, and stole the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) for himself. 

For the next five hundred years, the People of the Rainbow lived a hunted existence, scattered in small groups trying to avoid the ever-watchful eyes of [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>) and the violence of his servants. Until after the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), when [Uzgash](<../../people/orcs/uzgash.md>), the leader of a small tribe of orcs hiding in the [Nashtkar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>), discovered the long-lost [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) in a ruined Dunmari fort. Using the power of the cloak, he founded the kingdom of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>). The People of the Rainbow have lived in [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) ever since, under the protection of the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>). Over the years, as rumors of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) spread, lost tribes of the People of the Rainbow hiding in distant places have begun to return when they can. 

Now, the People of the Rainbow are thriving in [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), and perhaps in other hidden pockets of the world.

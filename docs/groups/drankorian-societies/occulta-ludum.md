   :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Drankorian](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) magical society  
</div>


A magical society associated with the development of magic and especially with practical inventions of harnessing magical power. 

While they rejected the extremist claims of the [Omnis Pura](<./omnis-pura.md>) in the later years of the [Drankorian Empire](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), there is little evidence that has come down to current day that they actively opposed [Omnis Pura](<./omnis-pura.md>).

Omnis Pura is a Hkaran supremacist organization dedicated to the proposition that it is only the pure blooded descendants of the ancient Hkaran urban elite that are destined to control the world.

Associated with the winning side of the [Drankorian Civil War](<../../events/drankorian-civil-war.md>), and played a prominent role in the later history of the [Drankorian Empire](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>). [Apollyon](<../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), ithe last Emperor of the [Drankorian Empire](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), was supposedly a supporter. 

Re-emerged in [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) some time after the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>).

</div>


The Eyes of Vedmakov, known colloquially as the Watchers or the Okolov, are the secret magical guard of [Ursk](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk/ursk.md>). 


They were once the ninth [Rodnya](<./rodnya.md>), known as the Rodnya Okolov. However, after the leader of Okolov made an infernal bargain and betrayed [Ursk](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk/ursk.md>), taking the name [Rhodar von Glauer](<../../people/other-nonhumans/rhodar-von-glauer.md>) and establishing a power base to the west of Ursk, on [Drachen Peak](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/drachen-peak.md>), the power of Okolov was broken. Now, the Watchers serve the other Rodnya, and also watch the Rodnya themselves, to protect against betrayals in the future.

# The Fraternity of the Empty Moon

The Fraternity of the Empty Moon is a cult of werewolves, dedicated to the mission of enhancing the power of the [Mad One](<../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/mad-one.md>) in Taelgar by creating and enhancing connections with the plane of [Pandemonium](<../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/primal-realms/pandemonium.md>).

The Fraternity of the Empty Moon is primarily active in [Central Dunmar](<../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/central-dunmar.md>), [Eastern Dunmar](<../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>), and the [Nashtkar](<../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>), with a particular interest in [Tokra](<../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), which is close to an [extraplanar weak point](<../cosmology/multiverse/extraplanar-weak-point.md>) linked to [Pandemonium](<../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/primal-realms/pandemonium.md>). 

As of DR 1748, the cult is thought to be destroyed.

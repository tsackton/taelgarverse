# The Stonebridges

A family of halflings who have lived in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) since at least the 1200s, and have run the Crossroads Inn since its founding. More sedentary than most halflings and deeply committed to the [Cleenseau Region](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau-region.md>).

# The Honeyhills

A family of halfling traders and sailors based in the Nevos Sea. 


The Honeyhills' two major trading ships, the Twilight Breeze and the Starlight Bough, which plied the coasts from [Darba](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>) to [Suhaya](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/suhaya.md>), were lost in a tragic storm north of [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) in the winter of DR 1743, with few survivors. Many of the Honeyhills who escaped tragedy were subsequently taken in by other halfling ships.

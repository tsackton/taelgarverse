# The Charmhearts

The Charmhearts are a prominent family of [halfling](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/halflings/halflings.md>) overland traders. They trace their history to [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), but for the past several generations they have made their living on long distance trade, bringing spices, furs, and dyed cloth from [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) to [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), as well as sometimes apple brandy from [Adderfell](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/adderfell.md>). 

Their traditional route brings them across the lower elevation eastern passes across the [Sentinel Range](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) on the road to [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), often crossing as early as the middle of March, aiming to arrive in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) in time to trade at the [Festival of Rebirth](<../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/festival-of-rebirth.md>), usually in early April. After a year circuiting [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), they return to [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) via the high passes from [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) in late spring when the snows melt. 

They are a serious trading family, and always travel prepared for danger, especially across the passes and the open frontier north of [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>).

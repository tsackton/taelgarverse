# The Charmhearts

The Charmhearts are a prominent family of [halfling](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/halflings/halflings.md>) overland traders. They trace their history to [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), but for the past several generations they have made their living on long distance trade, bringing spices, furs, and dyed cloth from [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) to [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), as well as sometimes apple brandy from [Adderfell](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/adderfell.md>). 

Their traditional route brings them across the lower elevation eastern passes across the [Sentinel Range](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) on the road to [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), often crossing as early as the middle of March, aiming to arrive in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) in time to trade at the [Festival of Rebirth](<../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/festival-of-rebirth.md>), usually in early April. After a year circuiting [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), they return to [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) via the high passes from [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) in late spring when the snows melt. 

They are a serious trading family, and always travel prepared for danger, especially across the passes and the open frontier north of [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). 




In 1748, the Charmhearts encountered trouble on the road from [Ausson's Crossing](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/refounded-alliance-of-aurbez/ausson-s-crossing.md>) to [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). Descending the passes on March 19, 1748, the Charmheart caravan stopped to rest and recover after the hard journey, at a well-used campsite near the old Dunmari fortress called Raven's Hold. [Ander Charmheart](<../../people/halflings/ander-charmheart.md>), a young and sometimes foolish member of the clan, went exploring, and was caught in a wave of demonic energy from a demon summoning. Driven mad, the Charmheart caravan was forced to deal with the situation in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). 

The demon at Raven's Hold was later killed by [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), but [Ander Charmheart](<../../people/halflings/ander-charmheart.md>) only slowly and partially recovered. What is more, during this time, gnoll raiders rampaged across [Eastern Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>), and little trading was possible. The Charmhearts made their way to [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) with crowds of Dunmari refugees, but the sickness and war seriously disrupted their trading year, causing significant losses. Later, they left [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) for [Darba](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>), hoping for better luck.

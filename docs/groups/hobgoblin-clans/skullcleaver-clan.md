   :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } A hobgoblin clan  
    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Based in [Irrla](<../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/irrla.md>), the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>)

The Skullcleaver Clan is a group of hobgoblins based in the northeastern part of [Irrla](<../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/irrla.md>). A relatively disorganized clan, as far as hobgoblins go, and hemmed in by the fortified and heavily defended borders of the Republic of Svolhas. The Skullcleavers are largely pirates and raiders; they have significant naval forces, and pose a notable danger to traders sailing from the ports of [Ursk](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>).

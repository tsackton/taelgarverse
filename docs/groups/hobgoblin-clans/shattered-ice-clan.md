</div>





The Shattered Ice Clan emerged from the [Sentinels](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range.md>) in the aftermath of the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), establishing themselves along the [South Fork](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst-south-fork.md>) and [Middle Fork](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst-middle-fork.md>) of the Enst within a generation. They became a growing threat on the border of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) and especially [Maseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>), are were a major force behind the second and [third](<../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>) hobgoblin wars. 

After the end of the [Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)](<../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>) they were pushed deep into the [Sentinel Range](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range.md>), and although raiders claiming to be aligned with the clan plagued the Sembaran borders for some time afterward, the survival of this clan into the current day is unconfirmed.

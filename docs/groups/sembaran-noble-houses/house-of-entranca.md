   :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Sembaran](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) noble family  
</div>


An ancient noble house in Sembara. Historically they claimed to trace their ancestry to Willibard the Dragonslayer, a possibly mythical Sembaran knight, who was said to have slain Azaroth the Accursed, an acid-spitting dragon, said to have terrorized the [Aine Hills](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/aine-hills.md>) after the fall of Drankor. Chiefly known as the noble house of the first monarchs of Sembara, and obscure and of little importance since the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>).

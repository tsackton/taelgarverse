# A Brief History of Taelgar

Long ago, in the ancient days of creation, the gods created sentient beings, first the Elder Folk, and later the [Humans](<../species/children-of-divine-creation/humans/humans.md>), who grew and spread from their ancestral home on the now-lost continent of Hkar. In the aftermath of the cataclysm that destroyed Hkar, [human](<../species/children-of-divine-creation/humans/humans.md>) refugees established the city of [Drankor](<drankorian-era/drankor.md>), south of what is now [Dunmar](<../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>). From this humble beginning, a great empire grew, based on magic, known as the [Drankorian Empire](<drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>). As the empire grew, it spread its language, [religion](<../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>), and culture across large swaths of Taelgar. 

Seven hundred years ago, the [Drankorian Empire](<drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) fell, brought down by a magical plague that even the great wizards of [Drankor](<drankorian-era/drankor.md>) could not stop. From the ashes of empire arose new realms and cities: [Chardon](<../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), a center of learning and the great city of the west; [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), a powerful monarchy in the east; the kingdom of [Dunmar](<../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), inhabited by a people of the plains, who migrated from the far away into the empty spaces left by the collapse of [Drankor](<drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>); and many others. But as these realms and others grew, the ancient skeletal dragon-god [Cha'mutte](<../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) was lurking in the north, biding his time and building his army of Hobgoblins and worse.

Two hundred years ago, [Cha'mutte](<../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) tried to overthrow the gods. The [Great War](<../events/1500s/great-war.md>), although it led to [Cha'mutte's](<../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) defeat, left the world changed. A vast crater now lies where mountain passes once carried trade caravans between [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) and [Chardon](<../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), and the fertile [Istaros](<../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/rivers/istaros.md>) river valley is now a choking land of dust and ash, called the [Plaguelands](<../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/plaguelands.md>). For fifty years or more after the [Great War](<../events/1500s/great-war.md>) ended, the remains of [Cha'mutte's](<../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) armies roamed the land. The boundaries of civilization shrank, trade decline, and famine and sorrow spread.

Over the past few generations, though, a new normalcy has come to the land, as the [Great War](<../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and its aftermath fades from memory. The [Chardonian Empire](<../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>) now stretches a thousand miles, built on the backs of the magical secrets of the [Great Library](<../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>). Peace and trade have once again come to [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), and the merchants of [Tollen](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) and [Cymea](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/cymea/cymea.md>) ply [Green Sea](<../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) once more. The Dunmari thrive behind the divine protections that guard their eastern border from the evils of the [Plaguelands](<../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/plaguelands.md>). While the frontiers remain dangerous, the world that has emerged from the darkness is one of hope.

## The Great War
DR 1462 - DR 1545; 1 Derik II - 26 Derik III

The reign of [Derik II](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-ii.md>) is relatively uneventful, and the traditions and formalities of the kingdom are established and propagated in this time. The borders to the south, with the [Istabor Alliance](<./istabor-alliance.md>), and the north, with the fractured fiefdoms of [Vostok](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/vostok/vostok.md>), are uneventful, and trading relationships with [Cymea](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/cymea/cymea.md>), [Tollen](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), and the rest of the eastern [Green Sea](<../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) grow during this time. 
#### Tensions in the North

The only thing that mars the peace of this era is increasing tensions among the highland kingdoms. Several small wars break out between [Ardlas](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkovia/ardlas.md>) and Lavnoch, fighting over control of the headwaters of the Semb and Lake Derwent, and with it access to the lucrative Dwarven trade, while tensions increase between [Breva](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkovia/breva.md>) and the Dwarves over the resources of the upper Teft. Although the violence never spills over into Sembara, trade is disrupted and what to do about the highlands is a constant question during the reign of [Derik II](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-ii.md>). [Derik II](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-ii.md>), although a strong king and diplomat, is not the military leader his father was, and was reluctant to raise taxes for an invasion.   

Several times the dwarves send diplomatic missions to Sembara, asking the king to deal with his people making trouble, and several times Derik II says there is nothing he can do. By the 1490s, it is clear the situation is untenable, as at this point both the halflings and dwarves are complaining to the king and telling him to get these unruly humans under control before they take it into their own hands, to ensure stability, but at this point Derik II is old, and uncertain, and so nothing is done.

[Charlotte I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/charlotte-i.md>), Derik II’s daughter, inherits the crisis. Unwilling to let relations with the dwarves deteriorate further, Charlotte rides with a large army up the River Semb, and in a relatively bloodless series of campaigns forces [Ardlas](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkovia/ardlas.md>) and Lavnoch to the negotiating table, asserting suzerainty over the territory of these kingdoms. [Breva](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkovia/breva.md>), fearing conquest, ceases hostilities with the dwarves, and [Charlotte I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/charlotte-i.md>) pushes no further, for by 1508 DR, rumors of something terrible in the north are growing. 
#### The Preamble to the Great War

After his defeat as the hidden puppet master of Dominion of Avatus, [Cha'mutte](<../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) has turned his attention north, where far across the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) he is growing an empire. Still maintaining footholds in the southern [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) where several loyal hobgoblin tribes attempt to prevent the consolidation of the [Istabor Alliance](<./istabor-alliance.md>) into a united front, he has turned his attention to a move from the north, through the empty northern steppes. Still working through proxies, and not ready to show himself yet, he summoned one of his dragonspawn, the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and set him to gather allies across the northern plains -- orcs, monstrosities, ogres, and trolls -- and set upon Vostok from the north. 



Derik III, 19 years old in 1508 DR, is sent to the north. Vostok at this point is ruled in the east by descendants of Skaer raiders, in the lakes region along the Volta increasingly by Zovcka, around Tollen largely as an oligarchy of rich merchants, and to the north as a loose confederation of semi-nomadic tribes. Derik III, channeling the charisma of his great-grandfather, cloaked in the blessing of the Gods, leads a grand alliance north to repair the ancient wall and defeat the dragon. In response, he is acknowledged as Prince of the North, and when he comes to the throne he is acknowledged as high king by the people of Vostok. Tollen retains its charter as a free city, but acknowledges the suzerainty of Derik III. 



By DR 1525, Derik III is at least nominally acknowledged as the overlord and high king of all the land from the southern highlands to the northern wall, from [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) to the [Western Gulf](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/western-gulf.md>).  In DR 1533, now several years a widower, Derik III marries Jane, the young daughter of an important merchant family in Tollen. 

Over the next 20 years, Sembara remains a strong and united kingdom as various conflicts spread along its borders, culminating in the [Great War](<../events/1500s/great-war.md>).

### The Blood Years

DR 1545 - DR 1600; 26 Derik III - 7 Blanche I

After the destruction of the Great War, Sembara experienced just over a year of much needed peace, marked largely by a huge influx of refugees from the south who settled in the [Duchy of Maseau](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>) and [Addermarch](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>). In DR 1547. the peace is shattered by a large, grim army following from the south on the heels of the refugees -- first a grim hobgoblin army, then a disorganized mass of monstrosities, great beasts, and other fell terrors fleeing something even worse from the south. Sembara fights to a desperate standstill, holding ground in the Mosteve Hills for several years of death and famine. In the fall of 1549, Derik III dies on the battlefield near Valarin -- but in death, he wins a great victory, and a measure of peace for Sembara, as the last great host of hobgoblins is ridden down and killed.   

Bertam I, Derik’s youngest son, takes the throne in December of 1549, a boy of 11. His mother, Jane, is appointed regent, and Bertram’s entire kingship is dominated by her, a shrewd woman who disliked waste. Bertram is not put forward as an heir by the Tyrwinghan [Oracle of the Riven](<../groups/oracle-of-the-riven.md>), and instead a local duke ascended to the throne. War-weary, and pragmatic by nature, Jane councils forcefully against any attempt to retake Tyrwingha by might of arms, and focused the kingdom on rebuilding the six duchies. In 1550, Rumors of an endless horde of orcs, and worse, reach Embry from Vostok in this time, and an embassy from several of the Vostok chieftains arrives, but is turned back with only a company of knights to support it, none of whom ever return to Sembara. But whatever chaos consumes the north, little of it reaches the Volta, save for rumors. But Jane and Bertram drop the title “High King of Vostok” from the royal titles and Vostok turns inward for its defenses.  

The year 1551 starts poorly, as winter lingers and it seems like spring will never come. And then, when spring does come, it comes in a season of unseasonably endless rain. Planting is delayed, and worries of famine, and worse spread. That summer, even worse news comes -- a deadly cloud of mists and fog moves north from the old territory of the [Istabor Alliance](<./istabor-alliance.md>). Everything -- plants, animals, humans, everything -- dies. Betram is ill-prepared for this threat and Jane pulls the borders close, abandoning the [Duchy of Maseau](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>) and [Addermarch](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>). The advance of this curse terrifies the population, and this is, in part, what gives these years the name “the Blood Years” as many die. The deadly advance is stopped by mysterious forces. The area south of the Mostove Hills is left uninhabitable, a barren wasteland of ash and dust, and starts being referred to as the Plaguelands. Famine, on top of plague, makes the winter of 1551-1552 one of the worst in memory, and many villages in the west are abandoned. 

Jane does what she can, but many in the kingdom believe that her true loyalties are more closely aligned with Tollen than her own kingdom -- what food there is to spare from the lowlands is often sold to Tollen instead of the highlands, and muttering can be heard in the Aine Hills and further north, of how Jane is not a true Sembaran.

Bertram I dies this winter, and his nephew, Bertram II (Derik III’s eldest grandson) takes the throne, a young man of 19. Born only three years before his uncle they were raised together as brothers, and Jane was like a surrogate mother to Bertram II. Reginald (Bertram II’s father) was a dashing lord and chief military advisor to his father. He spent much of his life on military campaigns and had little patience for court. His wife was a skilled knight as well, and spent much of her time on campaigns with Reginald. This left Jane to largely raise their children, and Bertam II grew up alongside Bertram I.

Bertram II began his reign in sorrow for his uncle, and never really found his footing. A handsome teenager, convinced of his own immortality and believing himself the equal of his grandfather, he believed he could right the wrongs of the kingdom himself. Jane, still powerful, was his regent for a year, and maintained the loyalty of the five major dukes until her death.

In 1558,  evil creatures attempt a crossing of the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) north of the devastation of Ulrich Monastery, as the Chardonian offensive in the west begins to put pressure on hobgoblin encampments. Still recovering from famine and plague, and still maintaining strong garrisons along the Enst, Jane councils strongly against Sembara joining this war. The highland kingdoms raise their banners anyway, and join together with the dwarves in a great alliance, which, after a series of early setbacks, decisively defeats the threat in 1561.  

[Bertram II](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/bertram-ii.md>), after his step-grandmother’s death in 1559, gathers a small force of knights, and without the backing of the Royal Council or any great thought to supply chains, logistics, or military strategy, rides north to aid the barons of Lavnoch and Ardlas against the evil threat. He dies in battle in the deadly winter of 1560, when the tide of battle is turned but great losses were suffered. In early March, 1561, word of Bertram’s death reaches Embry, and [Blanche I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/blanche-i.md>) is proclaimed queen.  

Blanche was the second daughter, and a quiet, scholarly woman, overshadowed by her strong willed sisters, Elaine and Anne. She spent much of her reign fascinated by the stars, and soon after rising to the queenship, proclaimed the heavens did not wish her to bear an heir. This announcement shook the royal court. The tension between Anne and Elaine was always strong. From birth, they were extremely close but also extremely competitive, extremely smart, and unable to see a way to share power or the throne. Anne and Elaine, however, as the third and fourth daughters of Reginald, had always been expected to be important duchesses, members of the Royal Council, but never in direct competition for the control of the throne.

The next few years were a time of factionalism. [Blanche I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/blanche-i.md>) retreated to her study of the heavens, largely ignoring the affairs of state. The barons of the highlands came to council less and less, and in the third year of her reign (DR 1563) the barons of Zovcka refuse her summons, and meet instead at the small trade town of Doka, and proclaim Mila, Baroness of the Upper Volta as Queen of Zovcka. Little is done in Embry, as Blanche proclaims the stars had foretold this. Anne, by now the young wife of the heir to the Duchy of Telham, argues for war, but [Blanche I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/blanche-i.md>) refuses to call her knights, and little comes of it.

1564 is a golden year of fine harvests, and peace throughout the kingdom. For the first time in living memory, no hobgoblins came over the mountains, no beasts rode north from the Plaguelands. [Blanche I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/blanche-i.md>), however, is increasingly distracted and sickly, spending much of her time searching the stars. She leaves the management of his kingdom to her Royal Council, which is increasingly divided into two hardening factions: Anne, backed by the Duchy of Telham and many of the small baronies in the highlands (at least those that were not turning their backs on Sembara), and Elaine, backed by the major dukes of the heartland, as well as the western and southern marches. 

In 1565, Blanche announces she will depart on a Grand Ambassadorship to the [Green Sea](<../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), planning to travel to [Tollen](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), [Skaerhem](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/skaerhem.md>), [Cymea](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/cymea/cymea.md>), [Tyrwingha](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>) and [Irrla](<../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/irrla.md>). Few believe it is wise for her to leave the kingdom for many months, but she  will not be dissuaded. In her absence, she appoints her father’s cousin, [Wisym I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/wisym-i.md>) as regent. Wisym is a diplomat and peace-maker, and spends much of his brief regency treating with the barons of Ardlas, Breva, and Lavnoch, as well as their dwarven neighbors.

Blanche returns to the capital in 1566, a changed woman - whereas before she was evenhanded in dealing with her sisters, on her return she clearly favors Elaine, and rumors spread that she has plans to name her her sole heir. She also returns with an offer of marriage to Elaine from the King of Tyrwingha. She accepts, and without forsaking her rights to the Sembara throne, retreats to live in Tyrwingha.

In DR 1567, Blanche dies, unexpectedly, in an accidental fall from a tower. Elaine immediately marches north, stopping at every castle and barony in the borderlands and the west, and the Duchies of Wisford, Chemin, and Sembara. She marches down the Semb and encamps five hundred knights outside the walls of Embry as winter falls. Anne does not retreat from this show of force. With the support of the Duchies of Arnsbury, Telham and Seham, and many of the highland barons, she marches her own army to the gates of Embry.

The winter passes slowly. Food is scare, and although no battles are fought, several skirmishes almost break out into a full blown battle. As 1568 dawns, it seemed to all that a battle would break out. Elaine and Anne were no longer speaking to each other. The first to leave were the barons of the highlands. As the capital emptied over fears of errupting violence, a compromise was reached. The halflings (or maybe lizardfolk?) negotiated an agreement: Anne would withdraw to Telham, Elaine to Tyrwingha, and Wisym would take the throne. 

Wisym was crowned king Wisym I in the summer of 1568. However, following the lead of Zovcka, Ardlas, Breva, and Lavnoch refused to acknowledge this compromise. Anne, with stronger ties to the Volta river valley, was proclaimed Queen of Breva, and Ardlas and Lavnoch proclaimed their own rulers.   

Elaine never lost her allies in Sembara, and often visited her younger brother Gyles, installed as the Duke of Sembara, and his household. Anne, more bitter at having had to agree to a compromise, spent fewer and fewer summers at the royal court, and increasingly withdrew into herself. She came to believe that she was cheated of the throne and spent more and more time researching amongst the libraries in Tollen for a simple solution (say, a charm to force her sister to acknowledge her as the rightful queen). Anne even travelled to Chardon, and gathered a small group of wizards around her.

Wisym spent two summers (in 1571 and 1572) campaigning in the highlands, but with little success. The highland kingdoms refused to be drawn back into the Sembara orbit. In 1573, a major force of hobgoblins probed the northern defenses, and were pushed back by the same  dwarven/highland alliance in 1561 that decisively defeated the hobgoblins, and that had now fortified the northern passes against further incursions through an alliance with the stoneborn and dwarves.

The next year, in DR 1574, a Sembara unprepared for a major attack was assaulted on the western front by a mass organized army of hobgoblins, seemingly allied with a darker horror. Rumors sped west from the battlefields of (something about mind flayers). The hobgoblins overran much of the west and south, and were stopped from overrunning all of Sembara only by great sacrifice. The next 4 years of the Hobgoblin Wars were the bloodiest in Sembara history since the Great War. Although the conflict ebbed and flowed, peace never lasted long, until, after 1578, it seemed that the ferocious (mind flayer allies) were defeated.

# The Drankorian Conquest
DR 300 - DR 431

### Overview
In the aftermath of [The Downfall](<../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>) the land that will become [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) is lightly populated. The [kestavo-worshipping](<../cosmology/religions/kestavo.md>) highlanders live in the foothills of the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), and have spread down the valleys of the great rivers: the [Semb](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>), the Volta, the [Teft](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/teft.md>), and the [Wistel](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>). Along the coast, [Skaer](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/skaerhem.md>) mariners raid, intermarry, and settle amongst the highlanders, and a Skaer-dominated mixed culture spreads from [Tollen](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) to the mouth of the [Semb](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>). The once mighty [lizardfolk](<../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) swamps have mostly disappeared, save for a remnant, [Ozabal](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/ozabal.md>), at the mouth of the [Wistel](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>), where a thriving lizardfolk community remains. South of the Wistel is the mixed community of humans, clustered along the coast, united by the their shared allegiance to the [Archfey Ethlenn](<../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey-ethlenn.md>).

Over a series of start-and-start campaigns over 60 years, the Drankorian armies conquer most of the lands between the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) and the [Western Gulf](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/western-gulf.md>), save for some of the highland realms in the northern foothills.

# The Drankorian Age
DR 431 - DR 1059
### Overview
By DR 431, when the Drankorian army retreated from Zovcka, the borders of Drankor in the east were established, and would not change for many generations. Drankor ruled all the lands between the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) and the [Western Gulf](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/western-gulf.md>) south of the [Semb](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>). North of the [Semb](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>), Drankor ruled the the region south and west of the Volta, as far north as the [Braebein](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/braebein.md>)

The Drankorians brought modern roads, improved agricultural techniques, and a new religion to the land. Farming and pastoralism was a way of life here, with little technology and little trade. No great wars were fought and [Mos Numena](<../cosmology/religions/mos-numena.md>) spread rapidly, and the old [Kestavan](<../cosmology/religions/kestavo.md>) traditions were largely forgotten.

# The Plague Years

In DR 1059, the Great Plague came and the Drankorian Empire collapsed. Little information survives from these years, but by the end of this period,

# The Six Duchies
DR 1250 - DR 1400
### Overview
By DR 1250, six great duchies had been established in the lands once ruled by Drankor: [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-sembara.md>), [Cheimen](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-cheimen.md>), [Wisford](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>), [Seham](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-seham.md>), [Telham](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/northlands/duchy-of-telham.md>), and [Arnsbury](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-arnsbury.md>). Each duke was a powerful lord and commanded fealty of barons and lords within their realms. 



# The Unification
DR 1400 - DR 1462, 7 Dominick IV - 34 Derik I
### Overview
By the 1400s, a number of regional powers had started to emerge on the borders of [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>). In the northwest, from the highland provinces of [Drankor](<drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), two realms had emerged: Lavnoch and [Ardlas](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkovia/ardlas.md>). Perched on either side of Lake Derwent, they grew rich with the profit of trade over the mountains, but were often in conflict over control of the lake and access to the Dwarven trade.

North of Lavnoch, the brief Unified Crown of Zovcka had collapsed, and two northern kingdoms emerged: Zovcka, in the north, and [Breva](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkovia/breva.md>), squeezed between [Braebein](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/braebein.md>) and the growing power of the Duke of [Arnsbury](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-arnsbury.md>), the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), and Zovcka. 

To the northeast, the [Duchy of Telham](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/northlands/duchy-of-telham.md>), between the [Teft](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/teft.md>) and the Volta, commanded the loyalty of many of the small lords along the coast and the rivers, and was closely tied by culture and intermarriage to [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>).

South of [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) were two major powers: the Kingdom of [Tyrwingha](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), which emerged from the fall of [Drankor](<drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) largely intact and still under the guardianship of the [Archfey Ethlenn](<../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey-ethlenn.md>), and the Dominion of Avatus, a rising military autocracy exerting overlordship of a number of small kingdoms in the [Mostreve Hills](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/mostreve-hills.md>), growing in power by taxing trade and recruiting mercenaries, largely Hobgoblins.

# The Peace of Cece
DR 1650 - DR 1713; 2 Cece I - 65 Cece 1
### Overview
In the autumn of 1650, after three summers of campaigning, the [Shattered Ice Clan](<../groups/hobgoblin-clans/shattered-ice-clan.md>) has been cleansed from the land. Three years prior, a hobgoblin dominion stretched in the Enst valley, from the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) to the headwaters of the Aure in Addermarch, and even northwards into the Barony of Varbonne. It is now gone, although people have only slowly started returning to the war-torn lands.

The reign of [Cece I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) is a time of peace and prosperity. The borders are secure, trade is growing, and Sembara's relations with its neighbors are friendly, and the hobgoblin threat, although not entirely gone, is isolated to [the Western Marches](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/western-marches/western-marches.md>).

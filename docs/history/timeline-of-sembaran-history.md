## The Drankorian Conquest
DR 300 - DR 431

### Overview
In the aftermath of [The Downfall](<../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>) the land that will become [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) is lightly populated. The [kestavo-worshipping](<../cosmology/religions/kestavo/kestavo.md>) [Zimka](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/zimkova.md>) live in the foothills of the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), and have spread amongst the highlands, and down the valleys of the great rivers: the [Semb](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>), the [Volta](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/volta-watershed/volta.md>), the [Teft](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/teft.md>), and the [Wistel](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>). Along the coast, [Skaer](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/skaerhem.md>) mariners raid, intermarry, and settle amongst the Zimka, and a Skaer-dominated mixed culture spreads from [Tollen](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) to the mouth of the [Semb](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>). The once mighty [lizardfolk](<../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) swamps have mostly disappeared, save for remnants: [Ozabal](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/ozabal.md>), at the mouth of the [Wistel](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>) and [Latazaro](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/cymea/latazaro.md>), in the east, where a thriving lizardfolk communities remain. South of the Wistel is the mixed community of humans, clustered along the coast, united by the their shared allegiance to the [Archfey Ethlenn](<../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey-ethlenn.md>), but otherwise the southern lands are largely empty of humans. 

Over a series of start-and-start campaigns over 60 years, the Drankorian armies conquer large portions of this land.

## The Drankorian Age
DR 431 - DR 1059
### Overview
By DR 431, when the Drankorian army retreated from [Zimkova](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/zimkova.md>), the borders of Drankor in the east were established, and would not change for many generations. Drankor ruled all the lands between the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) and the [Western Gulf](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/western-gulf.md>) south of the [Semb](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>), as well as the lowlands east of the [Braebein](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/braebein.md>) and the lowland valleys of the [Teft](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/teft.md>) and [Volta](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/volta-watershed/volta.md>). The borders of the modern duchies of Telham and Arnsbury still trace to the farthest extent of the Drankorian conquest, as does the borders of Ardlas. 

The Drankorians brought modern roads, improved agricultural techniques, and a new religion to the land. Farming and pastoralism was a way of life here, with little technology and little trade. Across the "Sembaran" provinces (which included the modern day [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), [Ardlas](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/ardlas.md>), [Maseau](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>), [Addermarch](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>), and [Tyrwingha](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>)), [Mos Numena](<../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) spread, and a common language and culture grew, and the old [Kestavan](<../cosmology/religions/kestavo/kestavo.md>) traditions were largely forgotten.

In the highlands, the [Zimka](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/zimkova.md>) kept the old ways, although along the borders with Drankor Mos Numena and Drankorian culture spread. 

## The Plague Years
DR 1059 - DR 1250
### Overview
In DR 1059, the Great Plague came and the Drankorian Empire collapsed. Little information survives from these years, and it was a time of much hardship, especially amongst the more populous lowland regions, where famine struck repeatedly. This was a dark time.
###
* 1142 DR: Adrian establishes himself in [Embry](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/embry.md>) as the first [Duke of Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-sembara.md>)

## The Six Duchies
DR 1250 - DR 1400
### Overview
By DR 1250, a number of lords, mostly calling themselves dukes, had established themselves across the lands once ruled by Drankor. In the lowland coastal regions, the six duchies that later would form the heartlands of Sembara had been established: [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-sembara.md>), [Cheimen](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-cheimen.md>), [Wisford](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>), [Seham](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-seham.md>), [Telham](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/northlands/duchy-of-telham.md>), and [Arnsbury](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-arnsbury.md>). Further east and south, [Tyrwingha](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>) had emerged from the chaos under the leadership of the [Oracle of the Riven](<../groups/oracle-of-the-riven.md>) and [Archfey Ethlenn](<../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey-ethlenn.md>). And to the west, two border duchies had emerged: [Brovna](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/western-marches/marches-of-brovna.md>), at the headwaters of the [Wistel](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>) around [Urlich Pass](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/urlich-pass.md>), and [Ardlas](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/ardlas.md>), along the south banks of the [Semb](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>), centered around ~LakeDerwentCity~,  the great trading city on Lake Derwent. 

To the far south, the fertile lands of the [Istabor Alliance](<./istabor-alliance.md>) beckoned, and much marginal land was abandoned in these years. But by 1250, the land is prospering and, from the scattered duchies that arose from Drankor, population begins to grow and spread.

Along the borders of [Brovna](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/western-marches/marches-of-brovna.md>), [Cheimen](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-cheimen.md>), [Wisford](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>), [Telham](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/northlands/duchy-of-telham.md>), and [Arnsbury](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-arnsbury.md>), a slow process of expansion began. As the peaceful years continued, and the population grew, the powerful dukes claimed new lands, largely empty, and granted baronies to their favored courtiers. 

One of these noble families, the [House of Entranca](<../groups/sembaran-noble-houses/house-of-entranca.md>), the Dukes of Sembara from the early 1300s, slowly grew in influence and power. The Duke of Sembara had emerged from the dark years with the largest and richest demesne of any of the duchies, and had always controlled [Embry](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/embry.md>), the ancient seat of the Drankorian regional government. Over the early 1300s, a series of minor crises and succession disagreements allowed the Entranca's to gain the loyalty of the the Dukes of Wisford, Cheimin, and Seham, who started more and more looking towards Sembara to resolve disputes and provide money and arms when dangerous forces appeared on their doorsteps.

By the end of the 1300s, the Duke of Sembara was broadly acknowledged as feudal lord by the Dukes of Chemin, Seham, and Wistford as well as many of the barons along the south banks of the Enst, the Aine Hills, and the lands between the Wistel and the Enst as far west as the Cleenseau Wood. 



## The Unification
DR 1400 - DR 1462, 7 Dominick IV - 34 Derik I
### Overview
By the 1400s, a number of regional powers had started to emerge on the borders of [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>). In the northwest, from the broad lands of [Zimkova](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/zimkova.md>), the realm of Lavnoch has emerged from the collapse of the short lived [Unifed Crown of Zimkova](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/zimkova.md>). 

The [Duchy of Telham](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/northlands/duchy-of-telham.md>), between the [Teft](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/teft.md>) and the [Volta](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/volta-watershed/volta.md>), had grown substantially, and commanded the loyalty of many of the small lords along the coast and the river, but was closely tied by culture and intermarriage to [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>).

In the west, the Duchy of Brovna had grown into a significant presence along the mountains, trading eagerly with the growing city of Chardon, and [Ardlas](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/ardlas.md>) was growing as well, trading with dwarves.

South of [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) were two major powers: the Kingdom of [Tyrwingha](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), which emerged from the fall of [Drankor](<drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) largely intact and still under the guardianship of the [Archfey Ethlenn](<../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey-ethlenn.md>), and the Dominion of Avatus, a rising military autocracy exerting overlordship of a number of scattered baronies and small lordships in the [Mostreve Hills](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/mostreve-hills.md>), growing in power by taxing trade and recruiting mercenaries, largely hobgoblins.

Into this moment, [Derik I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-i.md>), of a cadet branch of the [House of Entranca](<../groups/sembaran-noble-houses/house-of-entranca.md>), establishes the modern Sembara after the defeat of the Dominion of Avatus.

He also reestablishes the Duchy of Brovna.

By 1462, on [Derik I's](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-i.md>) death, the royal prerogatives of the monarch of Sembara are well established.




## The Great War
DR 1462 - DR 1545; 1 Derik II - 26 Derik III

The reign of [Derik II](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-ii.md>) is relatively uneventful, and the traditions and formalities of the realm are established and propagated in this time. The borders to the south, with the [Istabor Alliance](<./istabor-alliance.md>), and the north, with the fractured fiefdoms of [Vostok](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/vostok/vostok.md>), are uneventful, and trading relationships with [Cymea](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/cymea/cymea.md>), [Tollen](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), and the rest of the eastern [Green Sea](<../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) grow during this time. 
#### Tensions in the North

The only thing that mars the peace of this era is increasing tensions among the Zimka. Several small wars break out between [Ardlas](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/ardlas.md>) and Lavnoch, fighting over control of the headwaters of the Semb and Lake Derwent, and with it access to the lucrative Dwarven trade. Although the violence never spills over into Sembara, trade is disrupted and what to do about the highlands is a constant question during the reign of [Derik II](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-ii.md>). [Derik II](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-ii.md>), although a strong king and diplomat, is not the military leader his father was, and was reluctant to raise taxes for an invasion.  

Several times the dwarves send diplomatic missions to Sembara, asking the king to deal with the humans making trouble, and several times Derik II says there is nothing he can do. By the 1490s, it is clear the situation is untenable, as at this point both the halflings and dwarves are complaining to the king and telling him to get these unruly humans under control before they take it into their own hands, to ensure stability, but at this point Derik II is old, and uncertain, and so nothing is done.

[Charlotte I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/charlotte-i.md>), Derik II’s daughter, inherits the crisis. Unwilling to let relations with the dwarves deteriorate further, Charlotte rides with a large army up the River Semb, and in a relatively bloodless series of campaigns forces [Ardlas](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/ardlas.md>) and Lavnoch to the negotiating table, asserting suzerainty over the territory of these kingdoms. Soon after, in 1508 DR, rumors of something terrible in the north are growing. 
#### The Preamble to the Great War

After his defeat as the hidden puppet master of Dominion of Avatus, [Cha'mutte](<../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) has turned his attention north, where far across the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) he is growing an empire. Still maintaining footholds in the southern [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) where several loyal hobgoblin tribes attempt to prevent the consolidation of the [Istabor Alliance](<./istabor-alliance.md>) into a united front, he has turned his attention to a move from the north, through the empty northern steppes. Still working through proxies, and not ready to show himself yet, he summoned one of his dragonspawn, the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and set him to gather allies across the northern plains -- orcs, monstrosities, ogres, and trolls -- and set upon Vostok and Zimkova from the north. 



Derik III, 19 years old in 1508 DR, is sent to the north. Vostok at this point is ruled in the east by descendants of Skaer raiders, in the lakes region along the Volta increasingly by Zovcka, around Tollen largely as an oligarchy of rich merchants, and to the north as a loose confederation of semi-nomadic tribes. Derik III, channeling the charisma of his great-grandfather, cloaked in the blessing of the Gods, leads a grand alliance north to repair the ancient wall and defeat the dragon. In response, he is acknowledged as Prince of the North, and when he comes to the throne he is acknowledged as high king by the people of Vostok. Tollen retains its charter as a free city, but acknowledges the suzerainty of Derik III. 



By DR 1525, Derik III is at least nominally acknowledged as the overlord and high king of all the land from the southern highlands to the northern wall, from [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) to the [Western Gulf](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/western-gulf.md>).  In DR 1533, now several years a widower, Derik III marries Jane, the young daughter of an important merchant family in Tollen. 

Over the next 20 years, Sembara remains a strong and united kingdom as various conflicts spread along its borders, culminating in the [Great War](<../events/1500s/great-war.md>).

## The Peace of Cece
DR 1650 - DR 1713; 2 Cece I - 65 Cece 1
### Overview
In the autumn of 1650, after three summers of campaigning, the [Shattered Ice Clan](<../groups/hobgoblin-clans/shattered-ice-clan.md>) has been cleansed from the land. Three years prior, a hobgoblin dominion stretched in the Enst valley, from the [Sentinel Range](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) to the headwaters of the Aure in Addermarch, and even northwards into the Barony of Varbonne. It is now gone, although people have only slowly started returning to the war-torn lands.

The reign of [Cece I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) is a time of peace and prosperity. The borders are secure, trade is growing, and Sembara's relations with its neighbors are friendly, and the hobgoblin threat, although not entirely gone, is isolated to [the Western Marches](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/western-marches/western-marches.md>).

# The Third Hobgoblin War

A major conflict between the [Shattered Ice Clan](<../groups/hobgoblin-clans/shattered-ice-clan.md>) of hobgoblins and the [Duchy of Maseau](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>) and [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) during the reign of [Arryn II](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/arryn-ii.md>), [Charlotte I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/charlotte-i.md>), and [Cece I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>). It devastated much of the [Barony of Aveil](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>), the [Barony of Dunfry](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/western-marches/barony-of-dunfry.md>), as well as [Rinburg](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>) and parts of the [Duchy of Wisford](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>).

The war began when a new leader amongst the [Shattered Ice Clan](<../groups/hobgoblin-clans/shattered-ice-clan.md>), established in the southern banks of the [Enst](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) since the Second Hobgoblin War launched a brutal assault against [Maseau](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>) in the spring of 1644. [Sembara](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) quickly joined the fight, and after brief early success, endured a long series of setbacks and defeats. Only in 1648, when the young queen, [Cece I](<../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>), said to be blessed by [The Father](<../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-father.md>), takes personal command of the Radiant Alliance, does the tide turn.

Between 1648 and 1653 the Radiant Alliance pushed the hobgoblins further and further back, until the [Shattered Ice Clan](<../groups/hobgoblin-clans/shattered-ice-clan.md>) was decisively defeated in the foothills of the [Sentinels](<../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) in the summer campaign of 1653.

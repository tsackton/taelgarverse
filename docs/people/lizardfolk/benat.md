> A salt [lizardfolk](<../../species/lizardfolk.md>) (he/him)  
>> 

A lizardfolk man in the prime of his life, clean blue-green scales, wise eyes, but walks slowly and rubs his hands a lot. Particularly curious about local history. 

Benat serves as an informal liaison between the people of Hamri and the various coastal lizardfolk villages.

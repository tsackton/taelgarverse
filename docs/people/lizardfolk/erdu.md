- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A [lizardfolk](<../../species/lizardfolk.md>) (he/him)  
    Born DR 1517 (232 years old)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Ganboa](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/ganboa.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>)

![Lizardfolk Erdu](../../assets/lizardfolk-erdu.png){align="right"; width="320"}The spokesperson for the village of [Ganboa](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/ganboa.md>) when dealing with humans. Older, with graying scales. Has a relatively low opinion of humans, all things considered. His family has lived along the Enst for hundreds of years (he says), and he is skeptical of [Sembaran](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) claims to the land. 


The death of his brother [Edur](<./edur.md>) by giant spiders has further soured his opinion of humans.

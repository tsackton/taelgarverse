![Elazar Portrait](../../assets/elazar-portrait.png){align="right"; width="400"}A lizardfolk man in the prime of his life, a prophet, seer, and spirit guide who has deeply felt visions and exceptional perception into the spirit realms. A bit of an outcast in his village, seen as someone who sees trouble in everything.

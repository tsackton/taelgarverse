:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } The Cured of lycanthropy by [Delwath](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) on July 1st, 1748 in [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)  


Dag is the youngest member of the Hardstone clan, an extended family of dwarves that have lived at and worked for the [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>) for generations, helping to maintain the building. 


In the summer of 1748 DR, Dag was caught by werewolves when the [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>) were raided, and wounded, becoming cursed by lycanthropy. After he was subdued by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), he was cured by [Delwath](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), with the blessing of [Yezali](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/tanshi/meswati/yezali.md>).

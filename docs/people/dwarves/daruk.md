A dwarven scholar, who lived and died before the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), and was fascinated with lost runic magic. Rumors and tales say he traveled the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/feywild.md>), and to many other exotic places, seeking to understand how to create runic magic that would permanently change the essence of things. 


[Agata](<../fey/agata.md>), while pretending to be the fey creature [Typhina](<../fey/typhina.md>) whiled trapped in the [Ring of the Warded Mind](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/treasure/ring-of-the-warded-mind.md>), claimed that Daruk created the [Ring of the Warded Mind](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/treasure/ring-of-the-warded-mind.md>) and gifted it to [Typhina](<../fey/typhina.md>) as a present for her aid in helping him understand the nature of the magic of the [Heartwood Grove](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/heartwood-grove.md>). But whether there is any truth to this story, no one knows.

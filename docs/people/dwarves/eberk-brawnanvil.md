An elder [dwarf](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>), a respected member of the Brawnanvil clan and priest of the [Bahrazel](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>). He was born in the [Sentinel Range](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) before the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and grew up in the [dwarven outpost](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dwarven-outpost-raven-s-hold.md>) near [Raven's Hold](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/raven-s-hold.md>), but fled south during the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). He now lives with many other Brawnanvils in [Tharn Todor](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/tharn-todor.md>). 

Eberk is [Riswynn](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s great uncle, who helped her develop her divine magic, and passed along a map of the [dwarven outpost near Raven's Hold](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dwarven-outpost-raven-s-hold.md>) to aid her in the quest to recover the [Shield of the Brawnanvil Clan](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-raven-s-hold/shield-of-the-brawnanvil-clan.md>).

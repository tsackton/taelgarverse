A dwarven smith, born in [Ardith](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>) before the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). He was trapped there after the war, but rescued by an expedition sent from [Nardith](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/nardith.md>) in DR 1575, led by [Nora](<./nora-silverspark.md>) Silverspark and [Hagrim](<./hagrim.md>) Firebrand. Trapped in the shadowfell realm of [Bleakhold](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/bleakhold.md>) after the rescue mission failed. 

In DR 1748, he was freed from [Bleakhold](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/bleakhold.md>) by [Riswynn](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) and her companions, after the [Chalice of the Runepriest](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/chalice-of-the-runepriest.md>) was recovered. Joined the [Bleakhold](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/bleakhold.md>) refugees who traveled with [Riswynn](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) to [Nardith](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/nardith.md>), and is now settled there. While time passes differently in the [Shadowfell](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/shadowfell.md>), the years were hard on those trapped there, and he looks his chronological age. 

He has a nervous habit of sharpening his sword to the point of their being no edge at all, which he has found hard to shake even after being freed from [Bleakhold](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/bleakhold.md>).

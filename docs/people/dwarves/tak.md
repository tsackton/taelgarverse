A young dwarf, living in [Bleakhold](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/bleakhold.md>) but hoping for something better and wondering about the lives of [dwarves](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) outside [Morkalan](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/morkalan.md>), even before he knew such [dwarves](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) existed.

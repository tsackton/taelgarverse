Faldrak Bronzehammer is an aged dwarf runecrafter and tinker, with a touch of Feywild whimsy.
## Overview

Faldrak Bronzehammer, with his eccentric blend of traditional dwarven craftsmanship and fey magic, has become a subject of both admiration and curiosity. Born in Fahnukan, a strange northern dwarven kingdom, his life took an unexpected turn during an accidental sojourn in the Feywild. Although he emerged with peculiar behaviors, his enhanced craft bearing fey enchantments has left many in awe.
## Description

Despite his aging exterior and graying, rune-braided beard, Faldrak's eyes sparkle with mischief. His wardrobe—a combination of dwarven armor and fey fabrics—reflects his diverse experiences. A small pouch, perpetually moving, is always by his side. He walks with a cane, which seems to be magical and multipurpose.

## Events

- In DR 1748, during [Pyravela](<../../time/holidays-and-festivals/pyravela.md>) in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), Faldrak attended the party hosted by The Dunmar Fellowship on [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), where he met and bonded with Seeker, requesting his aid in journeying to the Edge of Echoes, a mysterious place where the boundaries between the planes (especially between Taelgar and the elemental planes) are thin.

    { .bio }

    Originally from: [Bleakhold](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/shadowfolds/morkalan/bleakhold.md>), [Morkalan](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/shadowfolds/morkalan/morkalan.md>), [Shadowfolds](<../../cosmology/demiplanes-and-echo-realms/shadowfolds.md>)

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by [Riswynn](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) on August 25th, 1748 in [Bleakhold](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/shadowfolds/morkalan/bleakhold.md>), [Morkalan](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/shadowfolds/morkalan/morkalan.md>), [Shadowfolds](<../../cosmology/demiplanes-and-echo-realms/shadowfolds.md>)  


Rurik is a dwarf, of indeterminant age, who remembers little of his life in [Bleakhold](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/shadowfolds/morkalan/bleakhold.md>) except his close connection to his son, [Tak](<./tak.md>), who he cares for deeply and worries over constantly.

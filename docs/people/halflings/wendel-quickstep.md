Wendel is the long-time proprietor of *The Windward Sail*, a busy sailor's tavern in Fiskurth. Known as a place for tales and stories - some true, many not - and a place for gossip, as well as a place to find a crew. Has a few dirty, cramped rooms stacked with "human sized" bunks, and some slightly more comfortable halfling rooms.

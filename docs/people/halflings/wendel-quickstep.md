Wendel is the long-time proprietor of *The Windward Sail*, a busy sailor's tavern in Fiskurth. Known as a place for tales and stories - some true, many not - and a place for gossip, as well as a place to find a crew. Has a few dirty, cramped rooms stacked with "human sized" bunks, and some slightly more comfortable halfling rooms. 
## Relationships
Wendel knows several regulars of [The Windward Sail](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/the-windward-sail.md>) well, including:
- [Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), an old acquaintance who frequented The Windward Sail in his youth
- [Nika](<../tollenders/nika-hyne.md>), a collector of tales and legends, with connections to the [University of Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/university-of-tollen.md>)

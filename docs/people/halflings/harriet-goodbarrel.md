:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by [Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) on DR 1730 at [The Singing Fox](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/the-singing-fox.md>), in Fairgate Outer, the [Free City of Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>)

Harriet's melodious voice graces *[The Singing Fox](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/the-singing-fox.md>)* on performance nights, drawing an enthusiastic crowd of locals and passing halflings. Though initially reserved, she truly shines when on stage, and alongside her wife, [Chenna](<./chenna-goodbarrel.md>), she's made the tavern a warm haven for many.

Harriet married into the Goodbarrel clan; while she never had her own children, she feels a matronly duty to all the scattered Goodbarrel youth. 
## Relationships
- [Chenna Goodbarrel](<./chenna-goodbarrel.md>), wife
- [Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), a distant relation, something like a third cousin once removed by marriage

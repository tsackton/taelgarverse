Harriet's melodious voice graces *[The Singing Fox](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/the-singing-fox.md>)* on performance nights, drawing an enthusiastic crowd of locals and passing halflings. Though initially reserved, she truly shines when on stage, and alongside her wife, [Chenna](<./chenna-goodbarrel.md>), she's made the tavern a warm haven for many.

Harriet married into the [Goodbarrel clan](<../../groups/halfling-families/goodbarrels.md>); while she never had her own children, she feels a matronly duty to all the scattered Goodbarrel youth. 
## Relationships
- [Chenna Goodbarrel](<./chenna-goodbarrel.md>), wife
- [Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), a distant relation, something like a third cousin once removed by marriage

Garret Tealeaf grew up traveling the roads of Dunmar with the Tealeaf trading family, eventually becoming the patriarch of a group of 5 well-armed and defended caravans that regularly made the circuit from Chardon, east to [Songara](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/songara.md>), Tokra, and Karawa, before turning south across the Yuvanti Mountains to Nayahar, and then north along the coast to Darba, and back to Chardon. 

## Relationships
- [Charmhearts](<../../groups/halfling-families/charmhearts.md>), occasional traveling companions after being freed from imprisonment in [Agata's lair](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/agata-s-lair.md>). 
- [Agata](<../fey/agata.md>), his captor and tormentor
- [Seeker](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>), who freed him from his wooden puppet form
- [Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>), who introduced him to the Charmhearts
- [Oswalt Tealeaf](<./oswalt-tealeaf.md>), a cousin
## Events
In DR 1737, the Tealeaf family fought of an orc attack from the [Dustthorn Horde](<../../groups/orc-hordes/dustthorn-horde.md>), associated with [Agata](<../fey/agata.md>). In revenge, [Agata](<../fey/agata.md>) herself attacked, killing a number of Tealeafs, and then capturing Garret, and using her magic to turn him into a wooden puppet, forced to serve her. She promised the surviving Tealeafs, including [Oswalt Tealeaf](<./oswalt-tealeaf.md>), that if they did not come east of the Hara River for 15 years, she would return Garret to them. 

The [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) saw a vision of this attack in the [Soul Lantern Vision](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/soul-lantern-vision.md>). 

Garret spent the next 11 years in servitude, as a wooden scarecrow, until he was rescued by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>). Since then, he has slowly come back to himself, although he reminds extremely nervous around magic, and especially any treasure claimed from Agata herself.

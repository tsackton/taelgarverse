:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Currently on [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), in the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/gulf-of-chardon.md>), the [Endless Ocean](<../../gazetteer/endless-ocean.md>)


![Mica Copperharp](../../assets/mica-copperharp.jpg){align="right"; width="250"}Mica Copperharp is a halfling sailor, formerly part of the crew of the [Stormdancer](<../../things/ships/stormdancer.md>), who followed his wife, [Willow Copperharp](<./willow-copperharp.md>), to join the crew of [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). He is a comic, a joker, good with his hands and the drums, but not always the most subtle or careful with his words. He is a good brewer, and likes a mug of ale and meeting new people.

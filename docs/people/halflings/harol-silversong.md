Captain of the [Emerald Song](<../../things/ships/emerald-song.md>). He is tough and wiry, tall for a halfling, with olive-brown skin and curly white hair, with bright silver eyes. Although not very talkative for a halfling, he has a good singing voice and often takes up the bass viol in the evenings.

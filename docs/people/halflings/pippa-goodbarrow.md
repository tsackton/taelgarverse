![Pippa Greenbarrow Portrait](../../assets/pippa-greenbarrow-portrait.png){align="right"; width="400"}Pippa is a cheerful halfling woman, with a warm, welcoming smile, often seen wearing a wide-brimmed hat. She has a love of good food, great ale, and great company, and attracts like-minded crew to her ship, the [Summer's Breeze](<../../things/ships/summer-s-breeze.md>). 

She has no fixed route or typical path, but is welcome is every port along the [Apporian Peninsula](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>) and the ~Emerald Coast~ for her genial nature, and her tendency to throw impromptu parties on deck.

# Mermin Stonebridge
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> A [Sembaran](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) [halfling](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/halflings/halflings.md>) (he/him), of the [Stonebridges](<../../groups/halfling-families/stonebridges.md>)

A young halfling trader based out of Cleanseau, although he travels between [Rinburg](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>) and [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) somewhat regularly.  Like most halflings, but unlike most Stonebridges, he is anxious to travel and is just looking for the opportunity which, as he says, "the ancestors want for him".

He was working with [Gentza](<../lizardfolk/gentza.md>) to potentially sell her remedy before she died and was shocked by her murder and the subsequent misuse of her medical investigations.

## Event
Dee was part of a party of adventurers (herself, [Dain Goldhammer](<../dwarves/dain-goldhammer.md>), and [Alban](<../chardonians/alban.md>)) who traveled to [Stormcaller Tower](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>) and returned to Chardon with several treasures, including [Hralgar's Eyes](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/hralgar-s-eyes.md>) and the [Binding Stones](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/binding-stones.md>). 

- Dec 23, 1747 DR: Arcus, Servius, Dee Wildcloak, Dain Goldhammer, and Alban leave Chardon together, on a mission to find treasure for the Society of the Open Scroll, funded by [Fausto](<../chardonians/fausto.md>).
- Feb 02, 1748 DR: Arcus, Servius, Dee Wildcloak, Dain Goldhammer, and Alban arrive in Songara.
- Feb 03, 1748 DR: Dee Wildcloak, Dain Goldhammer, and Alban leave across plains to the north, parting ways with Arcus and Servius. 
- Mar 13, 1748 DR: Dee Wildcloak, Dain Goldhammer, and Alban find the [Stormcaller Tower](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>), and make plans to explore. 
- Mar 18, 1748 DR: Alban, Dee Wildcloak, and Dain Goldhammer loot [Stormcaller Tower](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>), taking [Hralgar's Eyes](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/hralgar-s-eyes.md>) and the [Binding Stones](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/binding-stones.md>), which awakens [Hralgar](<../giants/hralgar.md>) in a confused, disturbed state. In the chaos of fleeing, Alban is killed.
- Mar 19, 1748 DR: Dee Wildcloak and Dain Goldhammer bury Alban outside Stormcaller Tower, and depart for Chardon
- Apr 22, 1748 DR: Dee Wildcloak and Dain Goldhammer arrive in Chardon with [Hralgar's Eyes](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/hralgar-s-eyes.md>) and the [Binding Stones](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/binding-stones.md>), and give them to [Fausto](<../chardonians/fausto.md>). 

After the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) acquired [Hralgar's Eyes](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/hralgar-s-eyes.md>) from [Fausto](<../chardonians/fausto.md>) and caused a stir in [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), Dee decided to flee south and get out of [Fausto](<../chardonians/fausto.md>)'s control, first traveling to [Darba](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>) and then booking passage south, past the [Sea of Storms](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/sea-of-storms.md>).

![Willow Copperharp](../../assets/willow-copperharp.jpg){align="right"; width="250"}Willow Copperharp is a halfling sailor, formerly part of the crew of the [Stormdancer](<../../things/ships/stormdancer.md>), who joined the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) out of a desire to witness and document their quest to end [Apollyon](<../historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>). She is a storyteller, a poet; serious and soft-spoken, but eloquent. She is religious as halflings go, devoted to the [First Ones](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/first-ones/first-ones.md>).

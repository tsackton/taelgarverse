![Roman Portrait](../../assets/roman-portrait.png){align="right"; width="400"}Roman is a dapper, silver-haired gentleman who runs [The Silver Wolf](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk/the-silver-wolf.md>), a high-end inn and restaurant frequented by merchants in town for the famous markets of [Zvervinka](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk/zvervinka.md>). His impeccable manners mask his self-centered perspective; Roman is always on the lookout for an angle to improve things for himself. Nonetheless, he knows how to run a high-end inn, and his establishment is a hub for gossip and intrigue.

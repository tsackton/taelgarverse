Fyodar is a large, burly man with a thick beard and a ready smile. He is a member of the Zvervinkan Guard, tasked with guarding the city gates and approving the entry of visitors and travelers coming to trade in Zvervinka's markets. 

He is well-connected among the city merchants and often has useful tips on where and what to buy, or sell.

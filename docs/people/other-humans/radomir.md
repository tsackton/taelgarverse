A man from a strange place to the east.

## Safri's Tale 

Maybe 10 or 15 years ago she met a strange man, maybe 25 at the time, from somewhere faraway to the east. Ursk, he said, and he spoke halting Common with a strange accent. He said his name was Radomir. He had run a long way, across the empty plains of the kenku and over the mountains, fleeing home, he claimed. He carried with him a [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/notable-items/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>) that he said he found in the far north, in the ice. The full tale is his to tell, not mine. But he also asked about destroying artifacts, for this [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/notable-items/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>) he carried haunted his dreams.

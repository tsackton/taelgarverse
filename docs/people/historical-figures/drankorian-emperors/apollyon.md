# Emperor Apollyon
>[!info]+ Biographical Info
> lich (undead), he/him
>> 

The last emperor of Drankor, who is said to have wanted to become a god. Creator of the [Scepter of Command](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/scepter-of-command.md>), and perhaps other artifacts of power. Was a very successful general and commander. 

Originally allied with [Cha'mutte](<../../extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>), although towards the end of his reign this relationship turned to conflict and when he died, he was imprisoned and prevented from resurrection by [Cha'mutte](<../../extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>).

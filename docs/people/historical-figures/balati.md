:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Died in the [Forest of Nightmares](<../../gazetteer/far-north/forest-of-nightmares.md>), [Ainumarya](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/ainumarya.md>), the Chasa-Nahadi Watershed


A hero of the Deno'qai during the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), and the man who once bore the armor and shield [Delwath](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) now carries.

He was a young warrior, blessed by [Nisir](<../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/nisir.md>), the tanshi of eagles and far sight, and by [Yezali](<../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/yezali.md>), the tanshi of the hunt, in his prime. He is said to have been able to sense enemies a mile away, and hunt them with implacable skill. When [Cha'mutte](<../extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s forces first probed the defenses of the Red River (the [K'eye](<../../gazetteer/far-north/k-eye.md>), the northern of the two rivers that cross what was once the northern edge of the [Forest of Dreams](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/forest-of-dreams.md>)), Balati led the ambush that drove back the hobgoblin vanguard, and his legend grew as it was said he called upon the tanshi to guide his spear and pierced the hobgoblin wizard's heart, killing him dead, from 1000 feet. But no mere mortal could stand against the forces of the [Abyss](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/primal-realms/abyss.md>) summoned by [Cha'mutte](<../extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>), and Balati fell with many others. It was only by a miracle that Balati's armor and shield were preserved undamaged, blessed by the tanshi.

The second wife of [Derik III](<./derik-iii.md>), from a powerful and rich merchant family in [Tollen](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>). She was Queen Regent in the immediate aftermath of the Great War, and history has not always been kind to her reign. Many consider her short-sighted and overly concerned with promoting her son, [Bertram I](<./bertram-i.md>), at the expense of his older half-siblings, [Reginald](<./reginald.md>) and [Hugh](<./hugh-of-sewick.md>). Others argue that her intelligence and careful stewardship of the throne prevented further deterioration of Sembara in the aftermath of the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>).

All agree that she was shrewd, at times spiteful, and always economical. She was known for her dislike of waste: wasted effort, wasted money, wasted time.

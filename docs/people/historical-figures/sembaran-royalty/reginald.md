The eldest son of [Derik III](<./derik-iii.md>) by his first wife, [Sarabet](<./sarabet.md>). Although he never reigned, largely due to the influence of [Jane of Tollen](<./jane-of-tollen.md>) to support her son during the chaos of the end of the Great War, he had five children, three of who reigned as monarchs.

His children were: [Bertram II](<./bertram-ii.md>), [Blanche I](<./blanche-i.md>), the twin sisters [Elaine I](<./elaine-i.md>) and [Anne](<./anne.md>), and [Gyles](<./gyles-of-teckberg.md>).

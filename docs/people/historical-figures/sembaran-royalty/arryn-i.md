# King Arryn I
>[!info]+ Biographical Info
> A [Sembaran](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) [human](<../../../species/humans/humans.md>) (he/him), of the [House of Sewick](<../../../groups/sembaran-noble-houses/house-of-sewick.md>)
> 
> 

A ruler of Sembara and Tyrwingha. The eldest son of [Elaine I](<./elaine-i.md>) and [Cynan](<./cynan.md>). As a young prince of Tyrwingha, while on a royal tour with his father, he was an early victim of the Cursed Cold, which left the lower half of his body withered and skeletal. His allegiances were more closely aligned with Tyrwingha than Sembara, and he rarely left his palace in [Tafolwern](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tafolwern.md>). He preferred to be seen with heavy blankets covering his lower body, and he was very self-conscious about his injuries.

Rumors persist in Tyrwingha to this day that he never really died, and instead fled to [Twilight's Grace](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/twilight-s-grace.md>) to seek healing.

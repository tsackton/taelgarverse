The king of Sembara during the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>); of the [House of Sewick](<../../../groups/sembaran-noble-houses/house-of-sewick.md>). He reigned from his mother [Charlotte I's](<./charlotte-i.md>) death in DR 1519 until his death, shortly after the end of the Great War, in DR 1549. 

He is known as one of the greatest kings in Sembaran history, a hero and legendary commander during the Great War, and the savior of his kingdom.

He had two sons ([Reginald](<./reginald.md>) and [Hugh](<./hugh-of-wisenfold.md>)) with his first wife, [Sarabet](<./sarabet.md>), and one son ([Bertram](<./bertram-i.md>)) with his second wife, [Jane of Tollen](<./jane-of-tollen.md>). 

Mostly due to the influence of his powerful second wife, [Bertram](<./bertram-i.md>) succeeds him upon his death.

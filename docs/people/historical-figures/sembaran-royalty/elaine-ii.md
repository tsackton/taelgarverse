</div>


The first monarch of the [House of Lils](<../../../groups/sembaran-noble-houses/house-of-lils.md>), descended from, Derik, the youngest son of [Elaine I](<./elaine-i.md>), and [Morgaine](<./morgaine.md>), a Tyrwinghan [oracle](<../../../groups/oracle-of-the-riven.md>).

Her reign was a time of peace and prospertity, and an intentional throwback to the glorious years of [Cece I](<./cece-i.md>). 

She was succeeded by her son [Arryn III](<./arryn-iii.md>)

The youngest daughter of [Charlotte I](<./charlotte-i.md>), she lived a long life and had eight children, who married into many of the noble families of Sembara and Tyrwingha.

Her eldest son, [Wisym I](<./wisym-i.md>), briefly ruled the kingdom after the Interregum of 1568, as a compromise between the warring camps of his cousins, the twin sisters [Anne](<./anne.md>) and [Elaine I](<./elaine-i.md>).

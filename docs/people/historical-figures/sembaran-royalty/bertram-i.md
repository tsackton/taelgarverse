Bertam I, [Derik III’s](<./derik-iii.md>) youngest son, came to the throne in December of 1549, a boy of 11. His mother, [Jane of Tollen](<./jane-of-tollen.md>), was appointed regent, and Bertram’s entire kingship is dominated by her, a shrewd woman who disliked waste.

He did not live long enough to have children. He is believed to have died of the effects of the Blood Plague.

The founder of the [House of Sewick](<../../../groups/sembaran-noble-houses/house-of-sewick.md>), he established modern Sembara at the Treaty of Wisford in the fall of 1429 and reigned over a united Sembara and Tyrwingha until his death in DR 1462.

He had five children, and was succeeded by his second son, [Derik II](<./derik-ii.md>).  His third child, Matilda, inherited the Duchy of Telham, and after his reign the Sembaran royalty no longer styled themselves "Dukes of Telham".

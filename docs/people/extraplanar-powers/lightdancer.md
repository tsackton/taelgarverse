>> 

Lord Egon, the Lightdancer, is the ruler of the domain of [Shimmersong](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>). Most of the time, they are vibrant, vivacious, obsessed with color and light and the beauty of the realm, but they have a dark side. For some time each year the Lightdancer retreats to hidden caves underground, and color fades from [Shimmersong](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>), while the Winter Knights patrol the borders protecting the realm from dangers.

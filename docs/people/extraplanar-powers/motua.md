In DR 1747, Motua fought [Grash](<../other-nonhumans/grash.md>) in the [Land of the Dead](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/proximate-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>), and was wounded, and driven to the material plane. They arrived at the [Footprint of the Gods](<../../gazetteer/far-south/azta-lekua.md>), in pain, wracked by spiritual chains created by the [Ring of Undying](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/ring-of-undying.md>), and unconsciously draining the spiritual essence of [Azta Lekua](<../../gazetteer/far-south/azta-lekua.md>), the Footprint of the Gods. Motua was healed by [Kenzo](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) and his [lizardfolk](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>)allies in DR 1748.

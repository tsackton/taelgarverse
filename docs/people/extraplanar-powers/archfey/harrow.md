# Harrow
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    An [archfey](<../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) (he/him)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Darkfall](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/darkfall.md>), the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/feywild.md>), [Multiverse](<../../../cosmology/multiverse.md>)
</div>


Harrow, the Shadow That Looms, is an archfey and the ruler of [Darkfall](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/darkfall.md>). He is often spoken of in the same sentence as [Wend](<./wend.md>), the Silence That Follows, ruler of [Hollowdark](<../../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/hollowdark.md>); whether these are truly two separate entities, or two aspects of the same dread, is not known.

An elder wyrm, one of the original children of [Arha](<../../cosmology/gods/high-gods/arha.md>) and [Malik](<../../cosmology/gods/high-gods/malik.md>).

Sought to overthrow the gods, breaking the order of things that has held since [The Riving](<../../events/ancient/the-riving.md>), freeing the elder races from the binds and power of the Embodied Gods. 

Was defeated in the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>).

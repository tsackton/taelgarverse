![Selma Wisthelwind](../../assets/selma-wisthelwind.png){align="right"; width="320"}Selma bought The Fox's Flagon for cash 8 years ago, and seems to enjoy running the inn as a retirement of sorts. From what exactly is not clear. She has always been a bit of an outsider in town and is one of the few people who keeps the old [Kestavo](<../../cosmology/religions/kestavo/kestavo.md>) religion of [Zimkova](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/zimkova.md>).

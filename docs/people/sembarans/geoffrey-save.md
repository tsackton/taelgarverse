    A [Sembaran](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) [human](<../../species/humans/humans.md>) (he/him)  
    Born DR 1692 (57 years old)  
    { .bio }

    Originally from: [Embry](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/embry.md>), [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>)
    Based in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>)

A compatriot of [Rinault](<./rinault-essford.md>), his family came to [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) when he was a young boy as part of [Wymar's](<./wymar-essford.md>) efforts to attract a larger market population. Recently inherited a thriving brewery and bakehouse from his parents at an unexpectedly young age, and also a significant landlord in Underhill. 

His wife Annabelle, has been ill frequently, and miscarried twice recently. Geoffrey has spent much time with [Rinault](<./rinault-essford.md>) instead of caring for his holdings, and often talks about how his family is cursed. His brother Jacques and his brother's husband, Ari have recently taken over the bakehouse and brewery, leading Geoffrey to complain even more to whoever will listen.

Vincent de Arban is an agent of [Susanne Garay](<./susanne-garay.md>). He visited [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) to investigate [Viepuck](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) (when he was masquerading as [Najeer Garay](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>)).  He was extremely interested in Viepuck's spider silk scheme, and may return to see how it is faring.

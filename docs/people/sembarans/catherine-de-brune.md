![Catherine de Brune](../../assets/catherine-de-brune.png){align="right"; width="320"}The cousin of [Sabine de Brune](<./sabine-de-brune.md>) and an trading agent for a number of Embry trading families, including the Garay Family. She is a confidant of [Rinault](<./rinault-essford.md>) and it is a rather open secret that she has an on-again, off-again affair with him.

Her husband Emmanuel is a doting father to their four children, and somewhat bookish.

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Last known location (as of DR 1715): [Asineau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/asineau.md>), the [Manor of Asineau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-asineau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>)


The heir of [Sarabeth Asa](<./sarabeth-asa.md>) and biological child of the Valbert family in Embry. He disappeared, along with his three grown children, in 1715. His father's family inherited the [Manor of Asineau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-asineau.md>) on his disappearance after a lengthy legal dispute, and ended up nominating a cousin, [Lorin Valbert](<./lorin-valbert.md>), for lord.

[Anselm's](<./anselm.md>) assistant at the [Temple of the Warlord](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/temple-of-the-warlord-in-cleenseau.md>). A young, rather shy man, who looks up to Anselm but has become fascinated by the [Heroes of Cleenseau](<../pcs/cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>). He is the main organizer of the [temple's](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/temple-of-the-warlord-in-cleenseau.md>) charity, and knows the people of Beggar's Way relatively well. He was one of the few people in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) who was sad to learn of [Nicholas the Beggar's](<./nicholas-the-beggar.md>) death.

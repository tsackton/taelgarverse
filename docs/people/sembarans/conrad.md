- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A [Sembaran](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) [human](<../../species/humans/humans.md>) (he/him)  
    Born DR 1699 (50 years old)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>)
</div>



[Anselm's](<./anselm.md>) assistant at the [Temple of the Warlord](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/temple-of-the-warlord-in-cleenseau.md>). A young, rather shy man, who looks up to Anselm but has become fascinated by the [Heroes of Cleenseau](<../pcs/cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>). He is the main organizer of the [temple's](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/temple-of-the-warlord-in-cleenseau.md>) charity, and knows the people of Beggar's Way relatively well. He was one of the few people in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) who was sad to learn of [Nicholas the Beggar's](<./nicholas-the-beggar.md>) death.

The nephew of [Ames Benthey](<./ames-benthey.md>), recently appointed sergeant of the [Bridge Patrol](<../../groups/sembaran-army/army-garrison-of-cleenseau.md>) after [Odo Cordwaner](<./odo-cordwaner.md>) was dismissed. He is untested and rumored to be somewhat stern, and not very close to his uncle.

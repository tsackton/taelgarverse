A striking and comely woman with a rough scar running from her eye to her neck. She is the sheriff of [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) and leads a part of the [Lord's Guard](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/lord-s-guard-of-cleenseau.md>). She has many opinions about her employers, in particular [Rinault Essford](<./rinault-essford.md>), and does not always successfully keep them to herself.

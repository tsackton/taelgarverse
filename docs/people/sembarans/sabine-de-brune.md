The aging castellan of [Valit](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/valit.md>), a vassal of the Baron of Aveil. Organized about managing the manor, but with a soft spot for bardic tales and romance. Never married, although is rumored to have had several great loves in her youth.

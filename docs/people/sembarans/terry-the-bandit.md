One of the bandits involved in the [Attempted Poisoning of Cleenseau](<../../events/1700s/1719/11/attempted-poisoning-of-cleenseau.md>). Local to [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), he fell on hard times during the winter of 1718-1719 and was recruited to banditry by [Fran√ßois](<./francois-the-bandit.md>).  He was killed by an enraged Ankheg during the battle outside the bandit lair on November 3rd.

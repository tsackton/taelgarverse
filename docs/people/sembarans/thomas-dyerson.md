![Thomas Dyerson](../../assets/thomas-dyerson.png){align="right"; width="200"}One of three assistants to [Victorine Rosseau](<./victorine-rosseau.md>), Thomas is an important magistrate in the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>) and often travels to investigate and adjudicate crimes on behalf of the Barony.

Lorin Valbert is the lord of [Asineau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/asineau.md>). He is the second cousin of the old lord, Robert Assante, who was much beloved before his death in 1715. Lorin did not expect to inherit a manorial lordship, and regards it as beneath his station, being a backwater far from the centers of power.

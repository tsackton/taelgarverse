    A [Sembaran](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) [human](<../../species/humans.md>) (he/him)  
    Born DR 1677 (72 years old)  
    Lord of the [Manor of Asineau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-asineau.md>) (DR 1715 - January 13th, 1720)

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Last known location (as of January 19th, 1720): heading towards the [Borderlands](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/borderlands/borderlands.md>), in [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/greater-sembara.md>)


![Lorin Valbet](../../assets/lorin-valbet.png){align="right"; width="320"}Lorin Valbert is the lord of [Asineau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/asineau.md>). He is a cousin of the old lord, [Lucas Asa](<./lucas-asa.md>) ,via Lucas' biological father. Lorin did not expect to inherit a manorial lordship, and regards it as beneath his station, being a backwater far from the centers of power. 

He has a wife and two young children who often reside in [Embry](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/embry.md>).




He fled his manor after the [Undead Attacks in Sembara](<../../events/1700s/1720/01/undead-attacks-in-sembara.md>), in part because he was convinced some of the misfortune of the Asa family was falling on him, and partly because he was scared and did not want to deal with the [Undead Attacks in Sembara](<../../events/1700s/1720/01/undead-attacks-in-sembara.md>).

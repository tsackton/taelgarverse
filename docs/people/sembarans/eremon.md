A newcomer to town and acolyte of the Night Queen. Eremon is well-travelled and a personal friend of [Rosalind's](<./rosalind-essford.md>). He walks with a pronounced limp.  He was from [Fellburn](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/fellburn.md>) originally and left shortly after [Cece I](<../historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) died. What he has been doing for the last seven years is not clear.

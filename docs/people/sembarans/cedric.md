A transman who lived in Underhill, he was killed by a zombie during the [Undead Attacks in Sembara](<../../events/1700s/1720/01/undead-attacks-in-sembara.md>) along with his unborn child. He lived at Tumbledown Farm, and was quiet and preferred the company of his husband (a solider in the [Army Garrison of Cleenseau](<../../groups/sembaran-army/army-garrison-of-cleenseau.md>)) to large groups. 

He was found near [Auloutte](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/auloutte.md>) by [Gideon Thorne](<./gideon-thorne.md>) and some other fishers.

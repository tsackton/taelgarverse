![Arthur Bybet Portrait](../../assets/arthur-bybet-portrait.png){align="right"; width="320"}The husband of [Rosalind](<./rosalind-essford.md>) (whom he married in 1706), he wisely takes a back seat in local affairs. He hails from a prominent family in [Ainwick](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-ainwick/ainwick.md>). He is a aficionado of stories and songs and often frequents [The Crossroads Inn](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/the-crossroads-inn.md>) to hear the latest news.

In the fall of 1719, he lost his three children during the [Tragic Flood of the River Enst](<../../events/1700s/1719/10/tragic-flood-of-the-river-enst.md>) and his and [Rosalind's](<./rosalind-essford.md>) sadness over this has been profound.

The captain of the household guard of [Essford Manor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/essford-manor.md>), part of the [Lord's Guard](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/lord-s-guard-of-cleenseau.md>) in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>). Likes to play dice with [Celyn](<../pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>). Better at delegating than doing any actual work and enjoys his food. However, when push comes to shove, he is a competent fighter and captain.

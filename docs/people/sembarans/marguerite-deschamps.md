    A [Sembaran](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) [human](<../../species/humans.md>) (she/her)  
    Chief Clerk of the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>) (since May 1719)  
    { .bio }

    Originally from: [Rinburg](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>)
    Based in [Veltor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/veltor.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>)

![Marguerite Deschamps](../../assets/marguerite-deschamps.png){align="right"; width="320"}The chief clerk of the Barony of Aveil, she is originally from [Rinburg](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>) and her family has longstanding ties to the [Duchy of Wisford](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>). Her appointment was widely seen as an attempt to ensure the [d'Aslains](<../../groups/sembaran-noble-houses/d-aslains.md>) did not dominate the barony for their own benefit.

![Gideon Thorne](../../assets/gideon-thorne.png){align="right"; width="320"}A fisherman and the most prominent person in the small hamlet of [Auloutte](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/auloutte.md>). Much of his family lives in the North Close of Cleenseau, including his son [Gabriel Thorne](<./gabriel-thorne.md>) and his nephew [Jon Thorne](<./jon-thorne.md>). He lives with his two grown daughters and their families, both of whom are also fisherfolk. 

He knows the river well, and is an admirer of the lizardfolk of [Ganboa](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/ganboa.md>). He went with [Rinault](<./rinault-essford.md>) on his ill-advised trip searching the river after the [Tragic Flood of the River Enst](<../../events/1700s/1719/10/tragic-flood-of-the-river-enst.md>).

An old man with a thick grey beard, a beggar who lived in the ramshackle Beggar's Way outside of [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>). His body was found in the Cleansing of the Ettercap Lair by [Najeer](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>), [Izgil](<../pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>), [Robin](<../pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>), and [Celyn](<../pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>). He was believed to have been killed by spider's on or around October 14th.

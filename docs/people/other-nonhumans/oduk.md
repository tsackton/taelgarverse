:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } The Banished back to the Abyss by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on April 12th, 1748 in [Raven's Hold](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/raven-s-hold.md>), the [Sentinel Range](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range.md>)  


Oduk is a demon created with the ability to corrupt animals into gnolls. 




He was summoned into the material plane, in the abandoned Dunmari stronghold of [Raven's Hold](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/raven-s-hold.md>), in the spring of 1748, where he was charged by his summoner to spawn as many gnoll warbands as possible and release them into the Dunmari frontier. He was [banished back to the Abyss](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-11-dufr.md>) by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) in April, 1748 DR. 



Later, the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) learned he had been summoned with the aid of the [demonic summoning scroll ](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/ivory-scroll-cap-vision.md>)provided by the hag [Agata Dustmother](<../fey/agata.md>) as payment in exchange for the [Scepter of Command](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/scepter-of-command.md>). This was part of a complicated plan by the [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>) to sneak into [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) with a flood of refugees, and complete a ritual to summon the madness of [Jinnik](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/high-gods/jinnik.md>) into the material plane using the [Extraplanar Weak Point](<../../cosmology/planar-concepts/extraplanar-weak-point.md>) north of [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), connected to [Pandemonium](<../../cosmology/spiritual-realms/pandemonium.md>), as a focal point.

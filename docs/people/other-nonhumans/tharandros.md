:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on April 12th, 1748 in [Samtal](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/samtal.md>), [Eastern Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)  



:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Last seen by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on June 1st, 1748 in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), [Eastern Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)  


![Tharandros](../../assets/tharandros.png){align="right"; width="500"}A centaur, the leader of a wandering herd. Wise and knowledgable.


The Dunmar Fellowship met this herd traveling across the [Samtal](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/samtal.md>), the northern plains of [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), and convinced them to aid [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), which proved crucial in driving off gnoll attacks. 

Tharandros stayed in Karawa for a time, but left to travel north with his herd in June, 1748.

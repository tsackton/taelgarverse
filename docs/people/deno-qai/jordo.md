The Godcaller of the [Te'kula](<../../groups/deno-qai/te-kula.md>), who found a [Jade Piece of Rai's Hand](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/gifts-and-heirlooms/jade-piece-of-rai-s-hand.md>). Refused to turn it over to [Grimbaskal](<../other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>), prompting Grimbaskal to attack and Rai and the tanshi [Aasimti](<../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/aasimti.md>) to work together to protect the [Te'kula](<../../groups/deno-qai/te-kula.md>) in a pocket dimension. 

Some of his stories were recorded by [Gnaeus](<../chardonians/gnaeus.md>) in [On the Lost People of the Forests](<../../things/books/on-the-lost-people-of-the-forests.md>).

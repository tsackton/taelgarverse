- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A Deno'qai [human](<../../species/humans.md>) (she/her)  
    Born DR 1717 (32 years old)  
    { .bio }

    Based in Bek'eni village, the [Elderwood](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/elderwood.md>), [Ainumarya](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/ainumarya.md>)

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Scryed by [Delwath](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) on October 22th, 1748 in Bek'eni village, the [Elderwood](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/elderwood.md>), [Ainumarya](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/ainumarya.md>)  




The formely disgraced Godcaller of the Bek'eni, out of favor due to [Mezzar](<../other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>)'s influence. Aided the party in their travels and fights in the [Elderwood](<../../gazetteer/central-highlands/elderwood.md>), and agreed to take charge of rebuilding the relations among the Deno'qai after [Mezzar](<../other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>)'s meddling. This seems to be going well, in Oct 1748 at least.

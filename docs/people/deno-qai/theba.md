- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A Deno'qai [human](<../../species/humans/humans.md>) (she/her)  
    Born DR 1717 (32 years old)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Bek'eni village](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/bek-eni-village.md>), the [Elderwood](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>), [Ainumarya](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/ainumarya.md>)

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Scryed by [Delwath](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>) on October 22nd, 1748 in [Bek'eni village](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/bek-eni-village.md>), the [Elderwood](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>), [Ainumarya](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/ainumarya.md>)  




The formely disgraced Godcaller of the [Bek'eni](<../../groups/deno-qai/bek-eni.md>), out of favor due to [Mezzar](<../other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>)'s influence. Aided the party in their travels and fights in the [Elderwood](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>), and agreed to take charge of rebuilding the relations among the Deno'qai after [Mezzar](<../other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>)'s meddling. This seems to be going well, in Oct 1748 at least.

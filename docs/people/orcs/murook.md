>>  Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on December 10th, 1749 in [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) 

Murook, an [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) woman from the [Plaguelands](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/plaguelands.md>), was freed from [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s curse in childhood by [Lubash](<./lubash.md>)'s father, Karguk. She now serves as the General of [Lubash](<./lubash.md>)'s army, and the unofficial leader of the Hezguli, the reborn [Orcs](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) who've been similarly freed.
## Overview

General Murook was born chained, under dark influence of [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>), to a wandering [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) tribe in the [Plaguelands](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/plaguelands.md>). She was freed from [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s hold by [Lubash](<./lubash.md>)'s father, Karguk, using the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>), and learned to exist as a free [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) in [Uzgukhar](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>). She now serves [Lubash](<./lubash.md>) as the commander of his armies, and also is the unofficial leader of the Hezguli, a group of [Orcs](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) that share a similar backstory of redemption.
## Description

A formidable [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) woman in her prime, with pale green skin, Murook is usually found in battle gear, wearing her chain mail and carrying a magical halberd she was gifted by [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), after they joined forces to defeat [Kadmos](<../chardonians/kadmos.md>) and his allies. Her demeanor is mostly silent, but her presence demands respect and attention.

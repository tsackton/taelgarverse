Vorgaz was a skilled [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) warrior and the commander of the garrison at [Khumarz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/khumarz.md>), on the western border of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), known for his tactical brilliance but lack of political acumen.

>>  Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on December 10th, 1748 in [Uzgukhar](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>), [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) 

A young man of 14, current heir to the kingdom. The family resemblance to [Lubash](<./lubash.md>) is apparent, but Uzgul is full of the vigor of youth, with a mohawk of wiry black hair, a dangling silver earring on a chain in one ear, and vibrant green skin. He has a nervous excitement to him, and has a hard time sitting still.

<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    An [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) (he/him)  
    Born DR 1734 (15 years old)  
    Member of the The People of the Rainbow  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Uzgukhar](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>), [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>)
</div>



:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on December 10th, 1748 in [Uzgukhar](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>), [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>)  


A young man of 14, current heir to the kingdom. The family resemblance to [Lubash](<./lubash.md>) is apparent, but Uzgul is full of the vigor of youth, with a mohawk of wiry black hair, a dangling silver earring on a chain in one ear, and vibrant green skin. He has a nervous excitement to him, and has a hard time sitting still.

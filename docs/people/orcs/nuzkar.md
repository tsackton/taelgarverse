    { .bio }

    Originally from: Gorzum
    Based in [Uzgukhar](<../../gazetteer/upper-istaros/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>), [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/upper-istaros/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/drankorian-hinterland/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>)

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Currently on [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), in the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/drankorian-hinterland/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>)


![Nuzkar Potrait](../../assets/nuzkar-potrait.png){align="right"; width="320"}An orc scholar, loremaster, and archivist, seeking stories, rumors, and information about other free orcs, about how [Thark](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s enslavement works, and how to free more of her people. 

She has a twin sister, [Aygul](<./aygul.md>), as well as a husband and large family in Uzgukhar. 


Inspired by [Riswynn](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>) and the [Battle for Uzgukhar](<../../events/1700s/1749/battle-for-uzgukhar.md>) to rededicate herself to her childhood dream of doing more for all orcs who suffer, unfree, in [Thark](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s control.

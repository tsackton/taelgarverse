Azogar is an old [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) loremaster from [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), one of the unchained [orcs](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) of the [People of the Rainbow](<../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>). He has dark green skin, which is almost black in patches, and long, but thinning white hair. He is frail and uses a cane to walk. Generally prefers simple robes and understated dress. Although he speaks with a wavering voice, he is clear and precise in this language. 

Azogar is very knowledgeable about the history of his people, and can tell many stories of the [People of the Rainbow](<../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>), both before and after the founding of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>). He serves as one of the primary advisors to [Lubash](<./lubash.md>), the chief of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>).

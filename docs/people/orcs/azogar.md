:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on December 9th, 1748 in Uzgukhar, Xurkhaz, the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>)  


Azogar is an old [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) loremaster from Xurkhaz, one of the unchained [orcs](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) of the People of the Rainbow. He has dark green skin, which is almost black in patches, and long, but thinning white hair. He is frail and uses a cane to walk. Generally prefers simple robes and understated dress. Although he speaks with a wavering voice, he is clear and precise in this language. 

Azogar is very knowledgeable about the history of his people, and can tell many stories of the People of the Rainbow, both before and after the founding of Xurkhaz. He serves as one of the primary advisors to [Lubash](<./lubash.md>), the chief of Xurkhaz.

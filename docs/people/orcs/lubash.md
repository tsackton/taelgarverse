Chief Lubash is the stern and protective ruler of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), and by extension the [People of the Rainbow](<../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>). He is also the bearer of the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>).  Lubash holds immense pride for his kingdom, [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), and resides in [Uzgukhar](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>).
## Overview

Chief Lubash ascended to the throne of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) three years prior. He took over rulership after a tragic event where his older brother, along with his brother's wife and child, were killed by marauding hill [Giants](<../../species/children-of-the-divine/giants.md>) during a royal tour. As a ruler, Lubash is marked by his intense pride in [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) and a deep-seated mistrust of gods.
## Description

Lubash has a pale green complexion and is bald. His features are striking, characterized by a long, stern face and a notably large nose.
## Relationships

- **[Uzgul](<./uzgul.md>)**: Lubash's nephew, the son of his younger sister, and his heir. Lubash is deeply protective of [Uzgul](<./uzgul.md>) since his sister passed away due to sickness when [Uzgul](<./uzgul.md>) was young.
- **[Murook](<./murook.md>)**: Lubash's chief general and confidante. 
- **[Azogar](<./azogar.md>)**: Lubash's loremaster and confidante.

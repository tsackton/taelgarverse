:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Killed by [Seeker](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) on May 5th, 1748 in [Kharsan](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>), the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>)  


An [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) cleric in [Grash's army](<../../groups/orc-hordes/grash-s-horde.md>). 


Captured in battle in May 1748 by [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), and interrogated before using magic to convince [Seeker](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) to kill him, seemingly because he insisted he could not die under [Grash](<../other-nonhumans/grash.md>)'s power. After his death, his body was burned and did not reanimate.

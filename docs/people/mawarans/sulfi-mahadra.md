    A Mawaran [human](<../../species/humans.md>) (she/her)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Hamri](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/hamri.md>), the [Mawar Confederacy](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawar-confederacy.md>), the [Mawakel Peninsula](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>)

Known as the Queen of Ships, she lives with her partner Iesha on Glittercliff. Owns a large fraction of the fishing fleet of [Hamri](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/hamri.md>), and is the most important boat builder in the region. She inherited and greatly expanded the family business and has been a fixture in Hamri for many decades. She also owns the North Dock, and makes a good profit from the rents collected for tie ups here. She controls a tollhouse (known as Sulifi's Tollhouse) on the North Dock and pays for guards that collect rents and walk the dock at night.

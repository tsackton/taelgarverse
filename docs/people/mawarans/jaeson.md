- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A Mawaran [human](<../../species/children-of-divine-creation/humans/humans.md>) (he/him)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Hamri](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/hamri.md>), the [Mawar Confederacy](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawar-confederacy.md>)
</div>


A somewhat shady character who lives in the Sunken Cliffs, just west of the main port of [Hamri](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/hamri.md>), neighbor to [Ryu](<../pcs/mawar-confederacy/ryu.md>) and [Trok](<../pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>). Keeps to himself but will occasionally do favors for Ryu in exchange for fish.

- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A Mawaran [human](<../../species/children-of-divine-creation/humans/humans.md>) (he/him)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Hamri](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/hamri.md>), the [Mawar Confederacy](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawar-confederacy.md>)
</div>


Orden is a beach bum of sorts, who lives in a shack on the beach,  north of the main port of [Hamri](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/hamri.md>). While he came from wealth, something happened that he refuses to talk about, and he now ekes out a living on salvage and what fish he can catch. He is short and stocky, with great bushy hair and a bushy beard, with many piercings and proud eyes. 

He is a friend of [Trok](<../pcs/mawar-confederacy/trok.md>); they often work salvage together, and sometimes smoke gatza on the beach late at night, each seeking their own solace. 

He is also [Hiyasa](<./hiyasa.md>)'s father.

A friend of Trok's, a beach bum who lives in a shack north of the main port of Hamri. Short and stocky, great bushy hair and beard, piercing proud eyes. Many piercings. Trok and Orden sometimes work salvage together, and often smoke gatza on the beach late at night, each seeking their own solace. Came from wealth, but something happened. Daughter Hiyasa.

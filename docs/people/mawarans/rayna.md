Rayna is a middle-aged woman in her mid-40s, with sun-kissed skin, strong features, and a determined expression. She has curly black hair that falls in loose waves over her shoulders, and her piercing green eyes are often squinted from years spent at sea. Rayna wears a practical sailor's outfit, consisting of a white linen shirt, brown leather vest, and sturdy breeches. She carries herself with a quiet confidence, born of a lifetime spent navigating the seas and facing challenges head on. She is a descendant of the Ocean Watchers, a proud member of a once-great sailing tradition, and is on a mission to uncover their lost legacy.

    A [dwarf](<../../../species/dwarves.md>) (he/him), of the [Shockstones](<../../../groups/dwarven-clans/shockstones.md>)  
    Born DR 1707 (42 years old)  
    Member of the [Silver Tempests](<./silver-tempests.md>), and the [Priest Thuhr](<../../../groups/dwarven-thuhr/priest-thuhr.md>)

    Originally from: [Zarkandur](<../../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/zarkandur.md>), [Am'khazar](<../../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/am-khazar.md>), [Labkhan](<../../../gazetteer/sentinel-range.md>)

Brelith was born in [Zarkandur](<../../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/zarkandur.md>), the City of Gems in the dwarven kingdom of [Am'khazar](<../../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/am-khazar.md>), the third child of a rich and powerful Dwarven family, part of the [Shockstones](<../../../groups/dwarven-clans/shockstones.md>), the ruling clan of [Zarkandur](<../../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/zarkandur.md>). Brelith's childhood was uneventful, full of study of history and religion, learning from the best tutors under the proud eyes of his parents, Diesa and Osrik. It was a peaceful and priviledged, but boring, childhood, and Brelith often longed for more excitement in his life. After reaching adulthood, and discovering his connection to the [Bahrâzel](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>) and membership in the [Priest Thuhr](<../../../groups/dwarven-thuhr/priest-thuhr.md>), he decided to leave home to seek adventure and glory in the name of the [Bahrâzel](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>).

Leaving [Zarkandur](<../../../gazetteer/central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/zarkandur.md>) and wandering with no particular aim, Brelith eventually met Cato Stormtouched, an itinerant priest of [the Wildling](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wildling.md>), a human with some skill in the arts of divine magic. Travelingn with Cato for several years, Brelith learned to channel the power of the storm himself, drawing on his connection to the [Bahrâzel](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>). 
 
During Brelith and Cato's travels together, they were attacked by bandits on the road in the wilds near the [Myraeni Gap](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/myraeni-gap.md>). Brelith's quick thinking and timely Thunderwave saved Cato's life. As a token of his thanks, he gave Brelith a holy symbol of the Wildling, as a mark of [the Wildling](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wildling.md>)'s favor. 
 
Spurred by this encounter to seek greater glories, the old priest told Brelith that the [Great Library](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>) in [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) was seeking adventurers and treasure-seekers to help recover ancient artifacts and knowledge of a lost age. And so, seeking excitment, Brelith headed towards [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) and glory.

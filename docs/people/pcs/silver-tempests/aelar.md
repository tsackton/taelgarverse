:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Last known location (as of May 1st, 1748): the [Tempest Towers](<../../../campaigns/great-library/tempest-towers.md>), [Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/voltara.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>)


Aelar is an elf and a monk, from the first generation of elves born after the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). Always something of a loner, he spent much of his early life on the streets of [Chardon](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), a bit of an outcast, learning to survive and fight while mourning in his own way the massive destruction of elven society during and after the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). 

Eventually, he found his way to the [Great Library](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>), where he was recruited to help search for lost artifacts and treasures from before the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) on the [Northern Frontier](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-frontier.md>) of the [Chardonian Empire](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>). In the city of [Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/voltara.md>), he met [Adrik](<./adrik.md>), [Aglath](<./aglath.md>), [Brelith](<./brelith.md>), and [Samso](<./samso.md>), and became one of the original members of the [Silver Tempests](<./silver-tempests.md>).

After the [Silver Tempests](<./silver-tempests.md>) defeated the beholder Vilaxes, Aelar departed Voltara, and his current whereabouts are unknown.

Mabist is a changeling of uncertain origin. Their first clear memory was waking on a straw bed in a quiet cottage in the mountains, the scent of herbs thick in the air. Their rescuer, Dinia, called them “soldier” before they even spoke; their stance made it plain. While they cannot recall the details of their past life, images sometimes come to them in flashes: a forest of silver leaves glinting the brilliant mid-morning sun; the sound and pulse of waves crashing like drums; banners of war fluttering in the winds. 

They know they are a fey, that they grew up in the Feywild, and were a solider and a knight, but who they fought for, and why, and even the faces of their life before slip away when Mabist tries to grasp them. Their dreams drift between echoes of two voices: one like bells in sunlight, the other like deep water pressing on their skull. They wake with fists clenched and tears on their cheeks, not knowing which voice to fear.

Over the course of a month, Mabist stayed with Dinia, their training coming back to them, both their martial prowess and their strange powers of control over magic, of the sea and the entities of the depths. Their rehabilitation was ended when Dinia's cottage was attacked by mercenaries of the Havoc Host. Mabist, on Dinia's orders, fled to Voltara, where they met the Silver Tempests.

> [!warning]- Mabist's Secret Backstory
> 
>Mabist is a changeling from the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/feywild.md>). They grew up in a time of war, a war between the fey and fathomless. They constantly yearned for it to cease and wished they could make a difference, so finally, when they came of age they volunteered to be a knight. Years of battle, bloodshed, and loss went by as Mabist rose through the ranks, gaining respect and trust from all. Eventually Mabist was even promoted to be a general of a full platoon. One day Mabist was tasked to take their men into the forefront of enemy lines, and so Mabist was gifted means of protection against the enemy's psychic powers, directly from the queen.
>
>Mabist tore through the enemy lines, leading their men. But as they reached the leader, their men quickly dwindled due to the unforeseen defenses and sheer power of the enemy. Somehow, although only a dozen of them were left, Mabist and their knights were able to reach the leader. The battle was quickly ended due to the leaders unforeseen abilities, so seeing their comrades on the verge of death, Mabist conceded themself to the enemy, allowing the enemy to fully control them.

>Mabist is a changeling from an unknown area. They trained in the abyss during a time of war, a war between the fathomless and fey. They constantly yearned for victory and wished they could be the one to end the queen, so finally, when they gained enough power, they became a warior. Years of battle, bloodshed, and deaths went by as Mabist rose through the ranks, gaining fear and respect from all. Eventually Mabist was even promoted to be a general of a full platoon. One day Mabist was tasked to take their men into the forefront of enemy lines. So Mabist was gifted means of protection against the enemy's mystical powers, directly from the leader.

>Mabist tore through the enemy lines, leading their creatures. But as they reached their queen, their men quickly dwindled due to the unforeseen defenses and sheer power of the enemy. Somehow, although only a dozen of them were left, Mabist and their monsters were able to reach the queen.  Mabist was quickly subdued by the queen though they were, for some reason spared.
>
>Mabist's vision went dark and their thirst for blood calmed. They only could remembered crying then a faint glow. Then, everything went blank, their memories and their life anything from their mental banks were gone. Only their common knowledge and proficiencies remained.
>
>The queen was saddened to see one of her greatest warriors was reduced to a savage blood craving beast; Mabist had even changed their appearance. The queen only recognized her knight when they had  been knocked out. It seemed Mabist's bloodthirst was calmed and they reached at strange form of discomforting peace. For the queen, she only saw a husk of her former warrior, for she whipped Mabist's memory. In an attempt to return Mabist to their former self, she instead created a blank sheet of paper. For Mabist, this is where everything went dark.
>
>The queen decided it was best for Mabist to not rejoin the feywilds and instead find their own story. So they were dropped off unconscious in an unknown area near a commoner hut. From then on Mabist was rehabilitated by Dinia.

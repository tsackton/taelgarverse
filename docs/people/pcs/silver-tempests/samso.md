- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A [lizardfolk](<../../../species/lizardfolk.md>) (he/him)  
    Born DR 1716 (33 years old)  
    Member of the [Silver Tempests](<./silver-tempests.md>)  
    { .bio }

    Originally from: Urkabi, [Portalia](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/portalia.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>)
    Based in the [Tempest Towers](<../../../campaigns/great-library-campaign/tempest-towers.md>), [Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>), [Greater Voltara](<../../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/greater-voltara.md>)

Samso was born in the small, isolated village of Urkabi, nestled near the source of the [Zurrua](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/zurrua.md>), a minor river west of the [Old Chardon Canal](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/old-chardon-canal.md>) in the [Chardonian](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>) provence of [Portalia](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/portalia.md>), on the [Apporian Peninsula](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>). It was a great place for a young lizardling to grow up, with endless hidden forests to explore in the foothills, and there was nothing that Samso enjoyed more than exploring the woods and streams of Urkabi and the surrounding land. As Samso grew, he spent longer and longer away from home, learning the paths and thoughts of the plants and animals of the [Zurrua](<../../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/zurrua.md>) valley. 

One year, returning to his village after exploring for several days, Samso was shocked to find Urkabi gone,  a black rot clinging to the trees and polluting the streams. Everybody he knew and loved was gone. The only clue left behind was a shimmering green sigil on the ground, that slowly faded as Samso watched.
 
Distraught, and overcome, Samso turned to the woods, living in seclusion as he helped the forest heal and river valley from whatever had happened. While in the seclusion in the woods around Urkabi, with no one to talk to, Samso learned to listen to the feeling of the animals and plants around him, able to extend his senses catch glimpses of the feelings of the natural world.
 
After many years with no sign of his family, and nothing but silence from the spirits of his ancestors, Samso decided he needed to venture out in the wider world learn what had happened, and he headed for Chardon. There, Samso learned that the Great Library was seeking adventurers to help recover lost artifacts and forgotten magic, and the learned sages of the Library seemed like the best option for clues. So he decided to join them and see what he could learn.

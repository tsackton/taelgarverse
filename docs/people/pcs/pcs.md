# Players of Taelgar

Many groups have adventured in Taelgar over the years. 

Among the most famous are the [Heroes of the Great War](<great-war/heroes-of-the-great-war.md>). While many of the details of their adventures are lost to time, now told as legends and myths, the names of [Rai](<great-war/rai.md>), [Kyr](<great-war/kyr.md>), [Aerin](<great-war/aerin.md>), and [Beryl](<great-war/beryl.md>), the heroes who defeated the shadow dragon [Cha'mutte](<../extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) and ended the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), are widely known. 

In the DR 1700s, four groups of adventurers are most active in Taelgar:
- The [Dunmar Fellowship](<dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), a renowned group of adventurers who met in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) in DR 1748, and have since [traveled across much of the world of Taelgar](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/dunmari-frontier-campaign.md>) in their flying skyship [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>). 
- The [Silver Tempests](<silver-tempests/silver-tempests.md>), whose exploits are [chronicled elsewhere](<../../campaigns/great-library-campaign/great-library-campaign.md>), a group of heroes made a name for themselves in the [Northern Provinces](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/northern-provinces.md>) of the [Drankorian Empire](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) in the late DR 1740s. 
- The [Heroes of Cleenseau](<cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>), a party of heroes who met in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) in DR 1719, and have since made a name for themselves as they work to defend the people of southern [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>). 
- The [Addermarch Mercenaries](<addermarch/addermarch-mercenaries.md>), a group of chance-met travelers, whose exploits in the service of [Caradoc](<../addermarians/caradoc.md>) the alchemist are chronicled elsewhere.

Other adventurers include:
- The Adventurers of Mawar, united by their shared home of [Hamri](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/hamri.md>), and whose exploits are [told elsewhere](<../../campaigns/mawar-adventures/mawar-adventures.md>).
- The companions of Oskar and Riswynn, who solved some problems around [Tharn Todor](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/tharn-todor.md>) in DR 1748
- The prisoners of Grimstone, who escaped from an abandoned manor in [Western Cymea](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/realms/western-cymea.md>).
- [Izar](<ausson-s-crossing/izar.md>), [Roe DoTorka](<ausson-s-crossing/roe-dotorka.md>), and [Soraine](<ausson-s-crossing/soraine.md>), who investigated a murder in [Ausson's Crossing](<../../gazetteer/upper-istaros/refounded-alliance-of-aurbez/ausson-s-crossing.md>) in DR 1688.

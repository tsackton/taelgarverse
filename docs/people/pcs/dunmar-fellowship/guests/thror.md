>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> A [dwarf](<../../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>)

A sailor and a pirate and a storm sorceror, feeling remose and praying to the [Bahrazel](<../../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>) to give him another chance, and nearly instantly pulled away to aid [Riswynn](<../riswynn.md>).

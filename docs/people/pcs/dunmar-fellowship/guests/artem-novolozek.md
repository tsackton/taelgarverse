![Artem Portrait](../../../../assets/artem-portrait.png){align="right"; width="320"}Human wizard, originally from [Ursk](<../../../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/ursk.md>), but fled the magocracy there, bringing a treasure – the crystalline heart of a remorhaz – as payment to a patron in [Medju](<../../../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/medju.md>) who will set him free from pursuers. Currently on his way to [Medju](<../../../../gazetteer/eastern-green-sea/medju.md>) after helping [Wellby](<../wellby.md>) and companions kill aboleth, and retrieve his treasure.

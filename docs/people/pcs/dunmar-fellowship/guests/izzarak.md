A lizardfolk shaman, traveler, and guardian to two young lizardfolk babies. Came to [Bedez](<../../../../gazetteer/far-south/bedez.md>) because he was told that the babies must get to the [Footprint of the Gods](<../../../../gazetteer/far-south/azta-lekua.md>). Traveled with [Kenzo](<../kenzo.md>). After helping to heal the wounds to the [Footprint of the Gods](<../../../../gazetteer/far-south/azta-lekua.md>), decided to stay and raise the babies in the protection of the spirits of the [Azta Lekua](<../../../../gazetteer/far-south/azta-lekua.md>).Â

A Deno’qai druid and devotee of the tanshi [Istari](<../../../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/istari.md>), the spirit of intense fire, and especially the forest fires that renew the land. Expert fisherman; travels with a wildfire companion. After bidding [Delwath](<../delwath.md>) farewell, returned to his role among the Deno’qai of the [Ko'zula](<../../../../groups/deno-qai/northern-tribes/ko-zula.md>) tribe.

   :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } An adventuring party  
</div>


An adventuring party who met in Dunmar and have traveled together from April 1748 through the present. 

Consists of:
- The elven warlock [Delwath](<./delwath.md>)
- The halfling scout [Wellby](<./wellby.md>) and his axebeak mount and companion [Baxter](<companions/baxter.md>)
- The dwarven bard, scholar, and rune master [Seeker](<./seeker.md>)
- The human monk [Kenzo](<./kenzo.md>)

They frequently travel with the dwarven cleric [Riswynn](<./riswynn.md>). The stoneborn druid [Drikod](<guests/drikod.md>) traveled with them from May 23 1748 through June 20 1748. 

In the fall of 1748, they were split up due to magical effects. During this time, they traveled alone.

- Seeker traveled with [Mikasa](<guests/mikasa.md>), [Raven](<guests/raven.md>), [Spirala](<guests/spirala.md>), and [Caulaus](<guests/caulaus.md>) in the Feywild
- Kenzo traveled with [Izzarak](<guests/izzarak.md>) in the lizardfolk jungles to the south
- Delwath traveled with [Iascaire](<guests/iascaire.md>) and [Aristaea](<guests/aristaea.md>) in the battlefields of the far north
- Wellby traveled with [Artem](<guests/artem-novolozek.md>), [Rufus](<guests/rufus.md>), [Shoal](<guests/shoal.md>), and [Alimash](<guests/alimash.md>) in the eastern isles. 
- Riswynn traveled with [Thror](<guests/thror.md>), [Rothfis](<guests/rothfis.md>), and [Merash](<guests/merash.md>) in the [Shadowfolds](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfolds/shadowfolds.md>) domain of [Morkalan](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfolds/morkalan.md>).

Kenzo, Seeker, and Wellby were reunited in the Feywild and traveled with [Caulaus](<guests/caulaus.md>) briefly.

The group was reunited on Nov 15 1748 in Dunmar.

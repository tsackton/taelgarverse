# Selkan
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> A [Dunmari](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) [human](<../../species/humans/humans.md>) (he/him)

A Dunmari man freed from the [Mirror of Soul Trapping](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-agata/mirror-of-soul-trapping.md>). 

He is prematurely aged, bald, weary eyes full of pain. His thumbs are cut off, he looks in rough shape.

An older man, in his mid-50s, bulky and solidly built, with gray eyes, short black hair, and a beard. He is the blacksmith in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), and a common partron of [Ikramâ€™s](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/ikrams.md>), where he can often be found drinking in the courtyard in the evenings.

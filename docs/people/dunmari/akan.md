## Chronology
- Mar 22, 1748 DR: Attacked with his extended family at the [Gomat](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/gomat.md>) oasis by enraged giant lizards. One of the few survivors. 
- Mar 23, 1748 DR: Met the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) (who [killed the lizards](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-2-dufr.md>)) while returning to camp to gather supplies for the ride to [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). They returned his sister's amulet to him (she was killed in the giant lizard attack), helped his family recover, and made a very favorable impression.

- Jun 15, 1748 DR: Returns to [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) from [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), for the [Feast of Bhishma](<../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/feast-of-bhishma.md>)

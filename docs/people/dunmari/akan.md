## Chronology
- Mar 22, 1748 DR *(Akan)*: Attacked with his extended family at the [Gomat](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/gomat.md>) oasis by enraged giant lizards. One of the few survivors. 
- Mar 23, 1748 DR *(Akan)*: Met the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) (who [killed the lizards](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-2-dufr.md>)) while returning to camp to gather supplies for the ride to [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>).

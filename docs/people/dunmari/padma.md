An innkeeper and master of a caravanserai waystation on the [Tokra-Darba Road](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/roads/tokra-darba-road.md>), running one of the first waystations on the west side of the [Copper Hills](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/darba-highlands/copper-hills.md>).  Generally well positioned to receive and pass along news. 

In late July 1748, was briefly cut off from Tokra by wyverns who had made a nest in the ruined mining town of [Vandar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/vandar.md>). Pleased to receive news that [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) had killed the wyverns and the road was clear on 26 July 1748.

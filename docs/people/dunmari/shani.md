A goat herder from the area around Karawa. 

In April 1748, she and the group of herders she traveled with were delayed returning to [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) for the [Festival of Rebirth](<../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/festival-of-rebirth.md>) because of a large fire, started by lightning from the endless storm around [Stormcaller Tower](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>). She met [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on the road, and warned them to flee east.

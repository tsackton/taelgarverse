</div>


The middle-aged Dunmari Head Archivist at the [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>). Cautious to a fault and rather uninterested in administration, allowing many basic functions of the [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>) to drift into disorganization and uselessness through lack of attention during his tenure.

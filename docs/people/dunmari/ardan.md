# Head Archivist Ardan

The middle-aged Dunmari Head Archivist at the [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>). Cautious to a fault and rather uninterested in administration, allowing many basic functions of the [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>) to drift into disorganization and uselessness through lack of attention during his tenure. 

As of mid-July 1748, he has allowed [Govir](<./govir.md>) to take over some of the administrative burden at the Archives, at the urging of [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), and has secured funds for [Govir](<./govir.md>) to hire additional scribes and clerks.

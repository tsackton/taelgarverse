- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A [Dunmari](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) [human](<../../species/humans/humans.md>) (he/him)  
    Born DR 1695 (54 years old)  
    { .bio }

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on July 1st, 1748 in [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)  



:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Last seen by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on July 9th, 1748 in [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)  


The middle-aged Dunmari Head Archivist at the [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>). Cautious to a fault and rather uninterested in administration, allowing many basic functions of the [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>) to drift into disorganization and uselessness through lack of attention during his tenure. 

As of mid-July 1748, he has allowed [Govir](<./govir.md>) to take over some of the administrative burden at the Archives, at the urging of [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), and has secured funds for [Govir](<./govir.md>) to hire additional scribes and clerks.

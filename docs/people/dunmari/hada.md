He was researching, with [Govir](<./govir.md>), the events surrounding [Exile of Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../events/1600s/exile-of-fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>) in DR 1625 from [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) in the [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>), in support of [Govir](<./govir.md>)'s planned treatise on the miracles of the [Five Siblings](<../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>) in aid of the Nayan dynasty. 

In 1748, Hada was captured by werewolves of the [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>), along with [Govir](<./govir.md>), his superior at the [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>). Imprisoned in the werewolves' hidden lair in [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), he was eventually killed by [Govir](<./govir.md>) while [Govir](<./govir.md>) was transformed into a werewolf and unaware of his actions under the curse of lycanthropy.

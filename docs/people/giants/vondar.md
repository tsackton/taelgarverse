A cursed giant who guards the passes from [Shimmersong](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/shimmersong.md>) into [Amberglow](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>), asking for a toll of a memory in order to pass. Killed, but presumably not permanently, by [Seeker](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and friends.

A cursed giant who guards the passes from [Shimmersong](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/shimmersong.md>) into [Amberglow](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), asking for a toll of a memory in order to pass. Killed, but presumably not permanently, by [Seeker](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and friends.

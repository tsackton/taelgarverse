    King of [Kaldhalla](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/kaldhalla.md>) (until DR 1511)  
    { .bio }

</div>




A powerful frost giant king who ruled the frost giant realm of [Kaldhalla](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/kaldhalla.md>) in its heyday. He established [Kaldhalla](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/kaldhalla.md>) as a refugee for the people of the north, and led his armies in many battles against dragons and other creatures of the north to keep the [~Northern Boreal Forest~](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/northern-boreal-forest.md>) safe. 

He led the giants of [Kaldhalla](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/kaldhalla.md>) into [war](<../../events/1500s/vimfrost-s-war.md>) against the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, ultimately falling in battle.

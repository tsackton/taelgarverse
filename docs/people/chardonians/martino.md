![Martino Portrait](../../assets/martino-portrait.png){align="right"; width="400"}Martino is a retired sailor, fisherman, and navigator. He once sailed widely along the coasts of [Apporia](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>), seeking the best fishing grounds, until he was hurt in a storm and lost most of the use of his right hand. 

He is extremely knowledgeable about the waters and coasts of [Apporia](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>), but now spends his days hanging around [Artevus](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/artevus.md>), gazing out to sea.

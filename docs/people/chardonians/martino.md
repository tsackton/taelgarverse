:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on May 6th, 1749 in [Artevus](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/artevus.md>), [Portalia](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/portalia.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>)  


![Martino Portrait](../../assets/martino-portrait.jpg){align="right"; width="400"}Martino is a retired sailor, fisherman, and navigator. He once sailed widely along the coasts of [Apporia](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>), seeking the best fishing grounds, until he was hurt in a storm and lost most of the use of his right hand. 

He is extremely knowledgeable about the waters and coasts of [Apporia](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>), but now spends his days hanging around [Artevus](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/artevus.md>), gazing out to sea.

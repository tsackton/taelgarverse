:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Petrified in the [Dunmari Fort (Gomat)](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dunmari-fort-gomat.md>)



:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Discovered as a statue by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on March 25th, 1748 in the [Dunmari Fort (Gomat)](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dunmari-fort-gomat.md>)  


An adventurer and treasure hunter from the [Society of the Open Scroll](<../../groups/society-of-the-open-scroll.md>), found petrified in the fort east of [Gomat](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/gomat.md>). 

Left [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) with [Servius](<./servius.md>), [Dee Wildcloak](<../halflings/dee-wildcloak.md>), [Dain Goldhammer](<../dwarves/dain-goldhammer.md>), and [Alban](<./alban.md>). Argued constantly with [Servius](<./servius.md>), acording to [Dee Wildcloak](<../halflings/dee-wildcloak.md>). Parted ways with other travelers in [Songara](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/songara.md>), presumably to press ahead. 

Passed through [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) alone in late February or early March, according to [Jasu](<../dunmari/jasu.md>) and [Ikram](<../dunmari/ikram.md>).

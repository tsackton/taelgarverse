# Amelia
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A [Chardonian](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>) [human](<../../species/humans.md>) (she/her)  
    Born DR 1728 (21 years old)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>)
</div>


Amelia is a mid-level official, part of the [Chamber of Stamps](<../../groups/chardonian-organizations/chamber-of-stamps.md>), involved in the work of managing the chalyte monopoly. 


Amelia was controlled for some time by [Fausto](<./fausto.md>) using the [Crown of Purity](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/crown-of-purity.md>), and when that control was broken she was left adrift and lost in her own mind, clinging strangely to Dwarven prayers for comfort.

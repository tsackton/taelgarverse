:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Currently trapped in the [Mirror of Soul Trapping](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/treasure/mirror-of-soul-trapping.md>), stored on [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), in the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/drankorian-hinterland/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>)




A barbarian. A huge Chardonian man, muscled and over 6 feet tall. Silent. Does not wear any armor, just a simple sailorâ€™s cloak, and carries a clearly well-loved and dangerous-looking halberd. 

According to [Marcella](<./marcella.md>), he was once a sweet sailor with a beautiful singing voice, but was turned somehow by [Kadmos](<./kadmos.md>) and now is his devoted servant.

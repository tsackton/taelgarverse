## Overview

A Chardonian adventurer, treasure hunter, and sellsword.

Vola was born on the streets of [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), living a life of squalor, disease, and poverty. Grew up in the Riverside slurms, near the chalyte refineries.  Eventually discovered by [Agon](<./agon.md>), who helped her grow into her power and fulfill her potential.  She moved to the Academy district, specifically the Whitsun Tower area, and grew into her talents as a scout and rogue, eventually becoming a treasure hunter effectively working for [Agon](<./agon.md>) and the [Society of the Open Scroll](<../../groups/chardonian-organizations/society-of-the-open-scroll.md>). 

She is dedicated to the cause of the [Society of the Open Scroll](<../../groups/chardonian-organizations/society-of-the-open-scroll.md>), believing in their mission to secure dangerous knowledge from those who would use it for harm, and to preserve magic for future generations.

Less friendy with [Riswynn](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), largely because or [Riswynn](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>)'s distain.

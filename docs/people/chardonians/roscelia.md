An elderly magician, prim and proper, a member of the Faculty of Magic at the [University of Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/university-of-chardon.md>) and [Kaeso](<./kaeso.md>)'s mentor.

Still somewhat friendly with [Kaeso](<./kaeso.md>), despite her disappointment in his path and refusal to share secrets with the [Society of the Open Scroll](<../../groups/society-of-the-open-scroll.md>).

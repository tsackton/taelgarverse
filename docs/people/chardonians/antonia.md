:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Imprisoned by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on December 8th, 1748, in the [Mirror of Soul Trapping](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-agata/mirror-of-soul-trapping.md>), [Uzgukhar](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>), [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>)  


![Antonia Portrait](../../assets/antonia-portrait.png){align="right"; width="320"}A lanky, red-haired Chardonian woman, wearing a probably-magical heavy suit of plate armor that seems perfectly molded to fit her body. 


Seemed to have mixed feelings about [Kadmos](<./kadmos.md>) actions to charm the party in [Session 44 (DuFr)](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-44-dufr.md>), and was not involved in the battle in [Session 45 (DuFr)](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-45-dufr.md>). 

As far as you know, still traveling with [Kadmos](<./kadmos.md>).

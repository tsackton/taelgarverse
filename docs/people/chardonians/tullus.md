Tullus is a portly man with spectacles perched on the bridge of his nose, surrounded by stacks of books and scrolls in his cluttered shop. He is a scribe and bookseller by profession, with a particular fondness for maps, albeit somewhat colored by a rather provincial lack of interest in distant, far off lands.

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by [Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) on May 7th, 1749 in [Castrella](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>), [Cedrano](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/cedrano.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>)  


Tullus is a portly man with spectacles perched on the bridge of his nose, surrounded by stacks of books and scrolls in his cluttered shop. He is a scribe and bookseller by profession, with a particular fondness for maps, albeit somewhat colored by a rather provincial lack of interest in distant, far off lands.

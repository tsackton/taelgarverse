![Nika Hyne](../../assets/nika-hyne.png){align="right"; width="320"}Nika Hyne is a sly young woman in her early twenties known to frequent [The Windward Sail](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/the-windward-sail.md>), listening to stories and doing odd jobs for coin. She was briefly a student at the [University of Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/university-of-tollen.md>): although she dropped out, she knows the area and the people well. She is a bit of a hustler.

Guy Marchand is a mapmaker from [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>), known for his meticulous craftsmanship and his thriving shop in Nordgate.
## Overview

Guy Marchand, a mapmaker and bookseller, resides in the Nordgate district of [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>), where he runs a shop on the bustling [Scrollwright Street](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/scrollwright-street.md>). This major thoroughfare connects [Magnus Street](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/magnus-street.md>) and [Godshome](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/godshome.md>), and is the heart of book production and related trades in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>). He is of Isinguese ancestry, and his shop doubles as a local center for the Isinguer diaspora in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>). 
## Description

![Guy Marchand](../../assets/guy-marchand.png)

Guy, an aging man in his mid-60s, looks young for his age; he has lived a comfortable life. His attire is modest but well-crafted, reflecting his middle-class merchant roots. He lives and works in a spacious, if cluttered, mapmaking shop on [Scrollwright Street](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/scrollwright-street.md>).
## Relationships

- **The Isinguese Diaspora:** Guy has established himself at the center of a loose, informal network of Isinguese in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>). While some dream of rebuilding [Isingue](<../../gazetteer/upper-istaros/isingue.md>), Guy and his circle are content preserving the memory and traditions of their fallen homeland.
- **Wanderers and Explorers:** While Guy himself doesn't travel, his insatiable curiosity about distant places has made him a friend of many wanderers. He exchanges tales, rumors, and knowledge about far-off lands with them, enriching his mapmaking skills, and making his shop something of a center for rumors and information. 
- **[Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>):** Guy remembers [Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) fondly. 
- **Sarah de Grey:** Sarah frequently dines at Guy's shop, with a few other local Isinguese.

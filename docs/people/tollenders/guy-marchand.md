## Relationships

- **The Isinguese Diaspora:** Guy has established himself at the center of a loose, informal network of Isinguese in Tollen. While some dream of rebuilding Isingue, Guy and his circle are content preserving the memory and traditions of their fallen homeland.
- **Wanderers and Explorers:** While Guy himself doesn't travel, his insatiable curiosity about distant places has made him a friend of many wanderers. He exchanges tales, rumors, and knowledge about far-off lands with them, enriching his mapmaking skills, and making his shop something of a center for rumors and information. 
- **[Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>):** Guy remembers [Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) fondly. 
- **Sarah de Grey:** Sarah frequently dines at Guy's shop, with a few other local Isinguese.

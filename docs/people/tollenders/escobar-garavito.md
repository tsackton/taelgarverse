![Escobar Garavito](../../assets/escobar-garavito.png){align="right"; width="400"}A young and charismatic student at the University of [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>), Escobar's journey from the humble village of [Lavila](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/cymea/lavila.md>) in [Cymea](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/realms/cymea.md>) to the bustling streets of [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) showcases his adaptability and determination.

Escobar is outgoing and gregarious, and often at the center of student activities and student life at the [University of Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/university-of-tollen.md>).

![Elder Godfrey Portrait](../../assets/elder-godfrey-portrait.png){align="right"; width="400"}Godfrey is an Elder of the Sibyl, strongly blessed and capable of channeling powerful miracles. He is associated with the large Temple of the Sibyl in Tollen. He is a serious, deeply religious man, knowledgable both in the lore of magic and the rituals and miracles of the Sibyl. 

Godfrey grew up in a small village in [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>). In his teenage years, it became obvious that he had a powerful and unusual connection to the Sibyl. He traveled to [Embry](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/embry.md>), and then later to [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), where he stayed.

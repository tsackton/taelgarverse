>>  Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on January 15th, 1748 in [Erelion](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/erelion.md>), [Orenlas](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/orenlas.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>) 

Vahaiya is a warrior, traveler, adventurer, and now artist and collector. After surviving the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), fighting alongside the Sembaran Army in the [Battle of Urlich Pass](<../../events/1500s/1545/battle-of-urlich-pass.md>), they traveled extensively around [Addermarch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>), the [Aurbez Plateau](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/aurbez-plateau.md>), [Maseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>), and other Sembaran borderlands. They made a name for themselves in the hobgoblin wars, but growing tiring of fighting after many years, decided to settle in [Erelion](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/erelion.md>).

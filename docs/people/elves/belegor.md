Belegor is a solitary [elf](<../../species/elves.md>) wanderer, who has travelled across the forests of the western region of Taelgar for many years, not wanting hide in isolation as many of his generation chose after The [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). 
## Overview

Belegor is an [elf](<../../species/elves.md>) of the 36th ka, the generation that came of age during the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). He chose to wander in his later years, after fathering children, and is driven by a sense of wanderlust but also melancholy for what was lost. 
## Description

Belegor is a tall, ageless [elf](<../../species/elves.md>), with medium length copper hair, pale skin, and green eyes. He wears elegant clothes in greens and yellows, with high collar and long, wide sleeves. Graceful.

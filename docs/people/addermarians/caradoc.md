    { .bio }

    Based in [Brantor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/brantor.md>), [Carlinshire](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/carlinshire.md>), [Addermarch](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>)

Caradoc is alchemist and scholar, who lives by himself in an isolated hamlet near the small village of [Brantor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/brantor.md>), outside [Roscombe](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/roscombe.md>). He is has neatly trimmed white hair, a short well-groomed beard, and is going a little bald on the top of his head, but otherwise does not seem to be particularly old or frail despite his age. His piercing green eyes are always alert, and walks and speaks with purpose. He dresses plainly, in carefully mended brown robes. 

Caradoc has a wide reputation across much of [Carlinshire](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/addermarch/carlinshire.md>) as a skilled alchemist. He rarely sells his potions and concoctions, though is free with gold to pay those who bring him alchemical materials. It is rumored he is fabulously wealthy from adventures in his youth, though no one has ever claimed to have seen this reputed treasure.

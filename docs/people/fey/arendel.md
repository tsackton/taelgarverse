    A [fey](<../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) (he/him)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Sunwine Hall](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/sunwine-hall.md>), [Emberwine](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/emberwine.md>), the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/feywild.md>)

Arendel is a boisterous and friendly member of [Lord Soven](<../extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-soven.md>)'s court. He is friendly, and loud, and looms larger than life, full of laughter and a quick wit. He loves to duel, and is extremely good at it, having rarely been beaten in his many years of fighting. He is a gracious winner, though, pleased and happy to be challenged. Though he often wagers on his duels, he almost never demands a payment that would be a hardship for his challenger to pay.

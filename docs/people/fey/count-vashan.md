    A [fey](<../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) (he/him)  
    { .bio }

    Originally from: [Amberglow](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberglow.md>), the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/feywild.md>), [Multiverse](<../../cosmology/multiverse.md>)
    Based in [Sunwine Hall](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/sunwine-hall.md>), [Emberwine](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/emberwine.md>), the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/feywild.md>)

Count Vashan, who calls himself by the epithet "The Broken Mask", is a drunken hanger-on in the court of [Lord Soven](<../extraplanar-powers/archfey/lord-soven.md>). He does not recall his origin any longer, and most have ceased to ask, leaving him to his forgetfulness. Persistent rumors claim that he was once a respected member of the [Cloudspinner](<../extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>)'s court, long ago.


In a brief moment of lucidity, Count Vashan spoke of how he was once a trusted advisor to the [Cloudspinner](<../extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>), but -- whether due to stupidity, or carelessness, or some hidden treachery in his heart, he no longer can recall -- he betratyed her, allowing [Cha'mutte](<../extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) to surprise her in a moment of weakness. Now, he seeks to forget what he did, drowning his past in the wines of [Sunwine Hall](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/emberwine/sunwine-hall.md>).

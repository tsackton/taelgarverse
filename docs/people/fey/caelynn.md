- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A [fey](<../../species/children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>) (she/her)  
    { .bio }

    Originally from: [Dreamhaven](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/dreamhaven.md>), the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>)
    Based in the [Free City of Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>)
</div>



:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on December 17th, 1748 in the [Free City of Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>)  


A fey woman from across the mountains, from the fey realm of [Dreamhaven](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/dreamhaven.md>), who has been living in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) for many years, although whether a hundred or a thousand is the matter of much debate. 
## Overview

Caelynn the Seer, a fey woman from the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>) domain of [Dreamhaven](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/dreamhaven.md>), has lived in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) near the [University of Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/university-of-tollen.md>) for an indetermine time -- at least a century, perhaps much longer. She is a mysterious presence, known for prophecy and lore and understanding of dreams, but rarely sharing her vast knowledge without a price of some kind. 
## Description

![Caelynn Portrait](../../assets/caelynn-portrait.png)

Caelynn is an elegant elfin woman of ambiguous age, with long silver hair and strikingly vibrant green eyes.  She resides in an unassuming house close to the University. Inside, there's a perpetual feeling of twilight. She often greets guests in a tea room, which boasts a unique circular table, which always seems to have space somehow to accommodate anyone who she invites to sit, while never feeling large. 
## Relationships

- Caelynn is well known across [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), although few would consider her even an acquaintance, much less a friend. 
- According to [Delios the Sage](<../tollenders/delios-the-sage.md>), the [Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers](<../../groups/tollen-guilds/ancient-and-honorable-guild-of-philosophers.md>) does not appreciate her presence in the city
## Events

- Acquired the "[Legendary Gates of Kenzo](<../../things/books/legendary-gates-of-kenzo.md>)" from [Seeker](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) in DR 1748, an adventure story granting readers the freedom to navigate their journey.
## Rumors and Information

Many rumors circulate about Caelynn
- she has lived in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) since it was founded
- she is just the latest in a long line of [Fey](<../../species/children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>) living as Caelynn
- she is actually the seer who founded the Ancient and Honorable Order of Shanachie (called the Shanachs, a philosopher's guild that supposedly dates to the original settling of [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>))
- her prophecies always come true
- her prophecies never come true, and ill befalls all who ask a prophecy of her
- she only speaks to those who give her a memory in exchange
- she collects secrets, and will only grant you a boon if you tell her something no one else knows
- she collects secrets, and will only grant you a boon if you gift her a secret, forgetting it in the process

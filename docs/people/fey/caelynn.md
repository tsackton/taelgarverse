    { .bio }

![Caelynn Portrait](../../assets/caelynn-portrait.png){align="right"; width="400"}Caeylnn, often known as Caelynn the Seer, is a fey woman from across the mountains, from the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/feywild.md>) realm of  [Dreamhaven](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/dreamhaven.md>), who has been living in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) for many years. While she does not discuss her history, rumors claim she has made Tollen her home for many centuries, or perhaps even a millenia. She is a mysterious presence, known for prophecy and lore and understanding of dreams, but rarely sharing her vast knowledge without a price of some kind. 
## Description
Caelynn is an elegant elfin woman of ambiguous age, with long silver hair and strikingly vibrant green eyes.  She resides in an unassuming house close to the University. Inside, there's a perpetual feeling of twilight. She often greets guests in a tea room, which boasts a unique circular table, which always seems to have space somehow to accommodate anyone who she invites to sit, while never feeling large. 
## Relationships

- Caelynn is well known across [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>), although few would consider her even an acquaintance, much less a friend. 
- According to [Delios the Sage](<../tollenders/delios-the-sage.md>), the [Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers](<../../groups/tollen-guilds/ancient-and-honorable-guild-of-philosophers.md>) does not appreciate her presence in the city
## Events

- Acquired the "[Legendary Gates of Kenzo](<../../things/books/legendary-gates-of-kenzo.md>)" from [Seeker](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) in DR 1748, an adventure story granting readers the freedom to navigate their journey.
## Rumors and Information

Many rumors circulate about Caelynn
- she has lived in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) since it was founded
- she is just the latest in a long line of [Fey](<../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) living as Caelynn
- she is actually the seer who founded the Ancient and Honorable Order of Shanachie (called the Shanachs, a philosopher's guild that supposedly dates to the original settling of [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>))
- her prophecies always come true
- her prophecies never come true, and ill befalls all who ask a prophecy of her
- she only speaks to those who give her a memory in exchange
- she collects secrets, and will only grant you a boon if you tell her something no one else knows
- she collects secrets, and will only grant you a boon if you gift her a secret, forgetting it in the process

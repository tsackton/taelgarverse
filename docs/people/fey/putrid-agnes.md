:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Last known location (as of May 3rd, 1749): [Shadowkeep](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/shadowkeep.md>), the Northern Green Sea



:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on May 3rd, 1749 in [Shadowkeep](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/shadowkeep.md>), the Northern Green Sea  


Putrid Agnes is a hag with a morbid fascination with beets. She lived for some time on the outskirts of [Shadowkeep](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/shadowkeep.md>) under the protection of [Rhodar von Glauer](<../other-nonhumans/rhodar-von-glauer.md>), feasting on the minds of those deemed unworthy of being turned to vampire spawn. 

She is rumored to have spend time in Ursk, but was driven out by [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>) some time ago, and her beet necklace stolen and locked away in [Voknaz Manor](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/voknaz-manor.md>), which she is desperate to recover. 

She is known for her [creepy lullabies](<../../primary-sources/songs/hush-little-beet.md>).

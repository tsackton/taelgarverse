Somi-nai, also known as Ember, or Sugarra among the [Lizardfolk](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>), stands as the personification of the volcanic essence and a spirit of the encompassing jungle.
## Overview

Representing the dual nature of creation and devastation, Somi-nai embodies the volatile energies of fire, lava, and the nurturing volcanic ash. This fire elemental is an intrinsic part of the jungle ecosystem, bringing both life and death through his powers.
## Description

![Fire Spirit](../../assets/fire-spirit.png){width="400"}

Somi-nai manifests as a fiery spirit, pulsating with intense heat and radiating the aura of the volcanic caldera. His very presence can make the air sizzle, and his moods can sway the balance between a nurturing warmth and an all-consuming inferno.
## Events

A fire spirit, the essence of the volcano, also called Ember, or Sugarra in the [Lizardfolk](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) tongue. A spirit of the jungle itself and of the destructive power and renewing energy of fire and lava and fertile volcanic ash. Powerful with Ohana ki. Fleeing an invasion of his home by the  [Elemental Plane of Fire](<../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-plane-of-fire.md>), which was eventually healed by [Kenzo](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), [Enari](<../lizardfolk/enari.md>), and [Izzarak](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/izzarak.md>).

- In DR 1748, [Azta Lekua](<../../gazetteer/far-south/azta-lekua.md>) was thrown out of balance by the presence of [Motua](<../extraplanar-powers/motua.md>), a wounded [Gidari](<../../species/children-of-belief/gidari.md>). Somi-nai fled his home as invaders from the [Elemental Plane of Fire](<../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-plane-of-fire.md>) threatened to overwhelm the volcano. The crisis was eventually averted thanks to the intervention of [Kenzo](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>), [Enari](<../lizardfolk/enari.md>), and [Izzarak](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/izzarak.md>).

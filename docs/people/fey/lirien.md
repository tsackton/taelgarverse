Lirien is a willowy, flame-haired fae with a presence that flickers between fierce determination and quiet sorrow. Her hair shifts in hue, from the deep gold of sunset to the dying embers of a hearth, its glow dimming or flaring in response to her emotions. Her eyes are a molten amber, catching and reflecting light like polished gold, though in moments of despair, they dull to the color of old brass. She wears a cloak of deep red and umber, tattered at the edges as if burned away by time, and carries a lantern wrought from delicate silver filigree, within which a single, flickering light still struggles to shine. 

She is the last Lanternkeeper of [Redsun Watch](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>), a minor member of [Redsun Watch](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>), charged with using the [Amberlight](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>) to seal cracks in the Sunset Gate that would sometimes appear from [Darkfall](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/darkfall.md>). When [Redsun Watch](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/redsun-watch.md>) finally fell, she fled, taking the [Amberlight](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>) with her and running to [Everlight's Bloom](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/everlight-s-bloom.md>). 


When the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) brought the [Cloudspinner](<../extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) out of [Cha'mutte](<../extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s prison on the ~Circular Island~, Lirien's [Amberlight](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/amberglow/amberlight.md>) flickered to life again, and she left [Everlight's Bloom](<../../gazetteer/extraplanar/feywild/everlight-s-bloom.md>) to search for the [Cloudspinner](<../extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>). She found [Vindristjarna](<../../things/ships/vindristjarna.md>), but was tragically killed in an attack by minions of [Harrow](<../extraplanar-powers/archfey/harrow.md>) and [Wend](<../extraplanar-powers/archfey/wend.md>).

Dear Festian,
I hope this letter finds you well. As promised, I am recording my observations of the lands I pass through. The crossing over the mountains was grueling and perhaps I should not have struck out from Tokra so early, but I was impatient to leave the Dunmari - fine people, but I have visited their lands twice before and the prospect of reaching Sembara left me breathless.

The land here is beautiful, but dry. It reminds me of the Mycani Gap, in some ways. Tall aspen and pine, and rushing water everywhere, but outside the rocky and gravelly streams, there is little signs of water. Patches of snow still dotted the high road as I came down from the high pass two days ago, but today I saw no snow. The land seems quiet. I have seen any people, although I saw a spiral of smoke from a cave in the mountainside yesterday. It seems the people here shy away from strangers, and I am walking with my sword and shield at the ready.

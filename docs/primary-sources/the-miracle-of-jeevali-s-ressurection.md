title: The Miracle of Jeevali's Ressurection
---


It is told among the Dunmari, that when their ancestors first came to the land now called Dunmar, it was dry and dead, a barren landscape cursed by an ancient plague, in which no crops could grow. The people suffered, and died, from drought and hunger and fear. 

Jeevali, it is said, who had sheltered her people on the long journey, wept in sorrow an despair, wept for her people who were starving in the land that should sustain them. She cried tears that poured from the heavens, falling as soft rains, cleansing the land and purifying the soil. Rivers sprung up where her tears fell, and the land was blessed. 

As she cried, the power of her tears grew and grew, washing away the curse upon the land. But she put so much of her power and spirit into her tears that she began to fade away. As the rains faded, so did Jeevali. She diminished, and was gone, falling silent to even the most fervent prayers of her miracle workers. 

For a year, the people, led by Bhishma, prayed, singing her name every day, calling to her, begging her to return. Though she was quiet, still, her people prospered. The harvests that year were bountiful, the lambs and calves and foals healthy and numerous. Until the hot summer passed, and the rains came again to fall gently on the land, the people prayed and chanted her name. 

Then, in a miracle, the rains came again and as new life began to grow from the fertile soil, Jeevali also grew from the ground, the power of the belief of her people restoring her.

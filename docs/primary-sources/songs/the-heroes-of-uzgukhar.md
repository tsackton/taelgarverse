[Verse 1:]
Sunrise siege at Uzgukhar, the battle fiercely roars,
Trebuchet towering, undead scores.
Seeker conjured a boulder, into the sky it soared,
Striking the siege beast, its threat no more.
Lord Boulder, they hailed, a hero made of stone,
In the heart of battle, they stood not alone.

[Refrain]
Drums beat on, as tales of valor grow,
Heroes strong, in the face of a shadowed foe.

[Verse 2]
Grash stood waiting, darkness in his eyes,
His ring of undying, a curse kept him alive
The heroes fought hard, through pain and through fear,
Their resolve unyielding, their mission clear.

[Verse 3]
Kenzos's courage, Delwath's blade bright,
Riswynn's divine light, shining through the night.
The ring was destroyed, the undead fell silent,
Victory at last, the battle now quiet.

[Refrain]
Drums beat on, as tales of valor grow,
Heroes strong, in the face of a shadowed foe.

[Verse 4]
Wellby's sacrifice, a spark in the dark,
Riswynn's prayer, a hopeful embark.
Life from death, the cycle renewed,
In Uzgukhar's heart, courage ensued.

[Refrain]
Drums beat on, as tales of valor grow,
Heroes strong, in the face of a shadowed foe.

[Outro]
And so the tale ends, but legends never die,
Under starlit skies, their spirits fly.

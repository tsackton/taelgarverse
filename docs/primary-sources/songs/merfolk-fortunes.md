## Lyrics

[Call] Ho, ye sailors, brave and true,  
[Response] Hoist the sails and hold the brew!

[Call] When the north winds blow up strong,  
[Response] Steer clear of the kelp and its siren song!

[Call] Oh, the merfolk, sleek and sly,  
[Response] They sing their songs as ships sail by!

[chorus]
Heave ho, sail high, watch where the kelp beds lie,  
Sing loud, stay clear, lest the merfolk draw you near!

[Call] Many a ship has sailed to meet,  
[Response] Merfolk’s charm and found defeat!

[Call] For kelp forests, thick and wide,  
[Response] All within them dangers hide!

[chorus]
Heave ho, sail high, watch where the kelp beds lie,  
Sing loud, stay clear, lest the merfolk draw you near!

[Call] Brave the waves but guard your sail,  
[Response] Or the merfolk’s spell be your jail

[Call] A sailor’s tale is old and grand,  
[Response] Respect the sea, and safely land!

[chorus]
Heave ho, sail high, watch where the kelp beds lie,  
Sing loud, stay clear, lest the merfolk draw you near!

[chorus]
By star and stone, by flame and sand,
Family divine, you guide our hand.
Life, war, truth, harvest, free,
By star and stone, by flame and sand,

[verse]
Jeevali, goddess of hearth and home,
In your warmth, we're never alone.
Through cycles of life and rebirth anew,
You guide our families, steadfast and true.
Your temples stand, in honor bright,
In your embrace, we find our light.

[chorus]
By star and stone, by flame and sand,
Family divine, you guide our hand.
Life, war, truth, harvest, free,
By star and stone, by flame and sand,

[verse]
Aagir, our shield in war's fierce blaze,
Protector in our darkest days.
God of fire, of death, and might,
In your name, we stand to fight.
Defender of honor, keeper of vows,
To you, we warriors bow.

[chorus]
By star and stone, by flame and sand,
Family divine, you guide our hand.
Life, war, truth, harvest, free,
By star and stone, by flame and sand,

[verse]
Sonkar, beauty and truth you weave,
In your justice, we believe.
Artisans under treasured eyes,
Create wonders not seen across skies.
Your scales balance, your gaze is just,
In your fairness, we place our trust.

[chorus]
By star and stone, by flame and sand,
Family divine, you guide our hand.
Life, war, truth, harvest, free,
By star and stone, by flame and sand,

[verse]
Laka, keeper of seasons and lore,
In your fields, our crops soar.
God of knowledge, of rain and earth,
Under your care, we find rebirth.
Centers of learning, your sacred space,
In your wisdom, we embrace.

[chorus]
By star and stone, by flame and sand,
Family divine, you guide our hand.
Life, war, truth, harvest, free,
By star and stone, by flame and sand,

[verse]
Chidya, wild and free, you roam,
Nature's child, the land your home.
Goddess of beasts and the weather's flow,
In your footsteps, we learn to grow.
Herders and nomads seek your face,
In your wilderness, we trace.

[chorus]
By star and stone, by flame and sand,
Family divine, across the land.
In unity, our hearts and voices rise,
Under open skies.
Family divine, together we stand.

## Lyrics

[verse]
In a shroud of mist, so thick and grey,  
A lone ship sailed the old bay way,  
Lost to the stars, no light to guide,  
Its captain stared at the turning tide.  
Then from the depths, a soft light shone,  
A mystic guide, through waters unknown.

[chorus]
Oh, the merfolk sing beneath the moon,  
The merfolk sing, a haunting tune,  
The merfolk sing, twixt wave and dune,
The merfolk sing, a sailor's boon

[verse]
The captainâ€™s heart, it filled with dread,  
As swirling fog around him spread.  
But figures danced across the foam,  
Singing songs of light and grace and home.  
With guiding hands, so fair and bright,  
They led his vessel through fog and night.

[chorus]
Oh, the merfolk sing beneath the moon,  
The merfolk sing, a haunting tune,  
The merfolk sing, twixt wave and dune,
The merfolk sing, a sailor's boon

[verse]
When morning broke, the shore was near,  
The fog had lifted, the sky was clear.  
Grateful tears the captain wept,  
By merfolk's grace, his life was kept.  
Back to port, with tales to tell,  
Of merfolk magic, that saved him well.

[chorus]
Oh, the merfolk sing beneath the moon,  
The merfolk sing, a haunting tune,  
The merfolk sing, twixt wave and dune,
The merfolk sing, a sailor's boon

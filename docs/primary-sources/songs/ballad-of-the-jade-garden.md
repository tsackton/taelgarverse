[verse 1]
In the depths where shadows weave,
Beneath the storm and ocean's heave, 
Lies a garden, lush and wide, 
Where merfolk secrets do abide. 

[chorus] 
O sing ye of the kelp so green, 
Where jade lies deep and still unseen, 
A hundred leagues west o' Tamaro Bay, 
Where secrets sleep 'neath waves of grey 

[verse 2] 
The merfolk dance with silken fins, 
Among the kelp where light begins. 
They tend the jade with gentle care, 
Each name a whisper, soft as air. 

[chorus] 
O sing ye of the kelp so green, 
Where jade lies deep and still unseen, 
A hundred leagues west o' Tamaro Bay, 
Where secrets sleep 'neath waves of grey 

[verse 3] 
From the deep, the jade does grow, 
Glowing faint with mystic show. 
Names of old, names anew, 
Sprout in gardens deep and blue. 

[chorus] 
O sing ye of the kelp so green, 
Where jade lies deep and still unseen, 
A hundred leagues west o' Tamaro Bay, 
Where secrets sleep 'neath waves of grey 

[verse 4] 
Tales are told of those who find, 
The garden vast, left behind. 
Merfolk's whisper, ocean's call, 
In the jade, the names of all.

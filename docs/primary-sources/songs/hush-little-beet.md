## Lyrics

Hush little beet, now don’t you cry,
Granny’s gonna make you into a pie.
If that pie is tasting sour,
Granny’s gonna add some boney powder.

If that powder is too dry,
Granny’s gonna watch somebody die.
If the death spills blood like rain,
Granny's laughter will echo your pain.

If that laughter chills your dream,
Granny’s got her beetroot cream.
If the blood red beet stirs fear,
Granny whispers, "Sleep, my dear."

If your slumber's filled with screams,
Granny thrives within your dreams.
If from nightmares you try to flee,
Granny claims your soul for tea.

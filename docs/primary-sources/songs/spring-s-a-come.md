## Lyrics

[verse]
In Ursk's embrace, when spring dares to show,
The snows flee slowly, revealing earth below.
With a sigh and a glance where once was white,
Comes the mud, thick and deep, a weary sight.

[chorus]
Oh, wade through the mud, dark and deep,
Where dreams of dry paths are lost in sleep.
But with each heavy step, let's not forget,
Spring's muddy cloak, winter's icy debt.

[verse]
Beneath the moon, 'neath the stars' faint light,
We spoke in whispers of the cold, the bite.
Of dragons white, and ice worms beneath,
Their shadows long in the winter's teeth.

[chorus]
Oh, wade through the mud, dark and deep,
Where once fierce ice did creep.
With a heavy heart, we welcome the spring,
For the mud, though tiresome, life does bring.

[bridge]
Let's not curse too hard the mud's embrace,
For it tells us we're safe, at least for a space.
In the thawing earth, and the softening ground,
In whispered tales, our resilience is found.

[verse]
Now gathered 'round fire, with tales to unfurl,
We remember the winter, the snow's icy swirl.
And though our boots sink, and our steps are slow,
In the mud lies the path where spring flowers grow.

[chorus]
Oh, wade through the mud, dark and deep,
A testament to the vigil we keep.
In each step, the story of survival we sing,
Of Ursk, of winter, and the arrival of spring.

[outro]
So here's to the mud, to the thaw, to the night,
To the end of the cold, the ice worm's flight.
Around the campfire, in our songs, we blend,
In Ursk, where the tales of winter never end.

### Lyrics

[call]
What should we trade for the dyes of Tollen?
What should we trade for the dyes of Tollen?
What should we trade for the dyes of Tollen?
Ere the winds blow fiercely

[response]
Barter with silks and the rarest spices,
Barter with silks and the rarest spices,
Barter with silks and the rarest spices,
Ere the winds blow fiercely

[call]
Where will we sail from Tollen's harbors?
Where will we sail from Tollen's harbors?
Where will we sail from Tollen's harbors?
Ere the winds blow fiercely

[response]
To lands unknown across the oceans,
To lands unknown across the oceans,
To lands unknown across the oceans,
Ere the winds blow fiercely

[call]
What do we seek in the cold northern frostlands?
What do we seek in the cold northern frostlands?
What do we seek in the cold northern frostlands?
Ere the winds blow fiercely

[response]
Dragonhide tough, to trade for treasure,
Dragonhide tough, to trade for treasure,
Dragonhide tough, to trade for treasure,
Ere the winds blow fiercely

[call]
Why do we sail to the ends of the ocean?
Why do we sail to the ends of the ocean?
Why do we sail to the ends of the ocean?
Ere the winds blow fiercely

[response]
For magic of old and the songs of our sires,
For magic of old and the songs of our sires,
For magic of old and the songs of our sires,
Ere the winds blow fiercely

### Lyrics

Oh, we sail the green sea wide and free, 
With the wind in our sails, merry as can be. 
From Tollen’s ports, where the dyes do bloom, 
To Praznitsky’s cold, 'neath the pale moon. 

Hoist the sails, catch the wind, off we go, 
Trading tales, singing songs, high and low. 
Halflings bold, with hearts so brave and true, 
On the green sea, under skies so blue. 

Past the waves, where the dragonhide gleams, 
In northern Praznitsky, where the icy wind screams. 
We barter and trade with the greatest of ease,
For treasures rare, 'cross the seven seas. 

Hoist the sails, catch the wind, off we go, 
Trading tales, singing songs, high and low. 
Halflings bold, with hearts so brave and true, 
On the green sea, under skies so blue. 

To Wahacha’s shores, where the kenku sing, 
And the feathers of trade, to our ships we bring. 
In lands far and wide, our stories unfold, 
Of halfling traders, so daring and bold. 

Hoist the sails, catch the wind, off we go,
Trading tales, singing songs, high and low.
Halflings bold, with hearts so brave and true,
On the green sea, under skies so blue.

Yes, on the green sea, we make our way,
Singing our shanty, day by day.

### Lyrics

Bright dawns in Tollen, where the colors meet, 
We trade at first light, where the waters do greet. 
Our sails catch the wind, as we leave the bay,
Laughing and singing, we're on our way. 

Heave ho, heave ho, 'cross Green Sea we fly, 
Dreams in our sails, under vast sky.
Deserts to snow, through calm and through storm, 
Halflings wander, sea tales to form. 

Northward Praznitsky, 'neath the aurora's glow, 
Seeking rare dragonhide found in the snow. 
Trade by the starlight, bright hearts alight, 
Sailing at dawn, fleeing dark northern night. 

Heave ho, heave ho,'cross Green Sea we fly, 
Dreams in our sails, under vast sky. 
Deserts to snow, through calm and through storm, 
Halflings wander, sea tales to form. 

Sing of Wahacha, where the kenku do dwell, 
Spices and stories, we trade and we sell. 
Gold for a tale, in warm sun's embrace, 
With every journey, we chart out our trace. 

Heave ho, heave ho, with the Green Sea we blend, 
Ancestors' whispers, on winds they do send. 
Deserts to snow, through calm and through storm, 
Halflings wander, sea tales to form.

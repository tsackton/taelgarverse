# Cavarrio's Chronicles of Drankor

A list of the Emperors of Drankor, based on Cavarrio's Chronicles of Drankor, considered the definitive history of the Empire in post-Great War Chardon. May not be accurate; written based exclusively on secondary sources, many of which have since been lost. Takes the form of annals of emperors.

Cavarrio divides the history of Drankor into five eras:
- Founding Era, when the Drankorian Empire was established and first grew across what is now the lower Istaros and the Dunmari Basin, and then into the western Green Sea. 
- First Peace, a long period of peace and prosperity and stability
- Western Expansion, when the Empire expanded north along the west coast
- Golden Age, a second period of peace and prosperity. 
- Decline, marked by civil war and then fruitless battles in the east, leading up to the destruction of Drankor.

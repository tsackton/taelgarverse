The Green Sea is a large inland sea, surrounded on all sides by significant land masses. To the west, it is bordered by the [Western Gulf](<western-green-sea/western-gulf.md>) and the Cymean Peninsula; to the north, by the varied islands of [Skaerhem](<western-green-sea/skaerhem/skaerhem.md>) and the strange lands of [Ursk](<northern-green-sea/ursk.md>); to the east, the mysterious and magical [~Eastern Islands~](<eastern-green-sea/eastern-islands.md>) separate the Green Sea from the oceans beyond; and a variety of diverse lands to the south. The large island known as [Irrla](<eastern-green-sea/irrla.md>) forms the boundary between the [Eastern Green Sea](<eastern-green-sea/eastern-green-sea.md>) and the [Western Green Sea](<western-green-sea/western-green-sea.md>). 

Climatically, the [Western Green Sea](<western-green-sea/western-green-sea.md>) is dominated by the spring and summer monsoons that bring rain from the ocean to [Sembara](<greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), [Cymea](<western-green-sea/cymea/cymea.md>),  [Tyrwingha](<greater-sembara/tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), and [Vostok](<western-green-sea/vostok/vostok.md>). The monsoon winds drive upwelling, and the [Western Green Sea](<western-green-sea/western-green-sea.md>) is rich in phytoplankton and the marine life that feeds on it, giving the Green Sea the characteristic greenish tint from which its name derives. The [Eastern Green Sea](<eastern-green-sea/eastern-green-sea.md>), much less affected by the monsoons, and with wider expanses of open water, tends towards maritime climates along the immediate coast, often with drier summers and wet winters. 

The prevailing winds tend to favor sailing east in the winter, and west in the summer, especially along the north and west parts of the ocean, where monsoon winds are most dominant.

The pirate realm of [Illoria](<./illoria.md>) is the major culture of the [Nevos Sea](<./nevos-sea.md>), although since its conquest by the [Chardonian Empire](<../greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>) the southern (unconquered) islands have splinted somewhat. Historically, [Castrella](<../greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/castrella.md>) was a major realm in the region, although it has been part of the [Chardonian Empire](<../greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>) for over a hundred years now.

# The Forest of Nightmares
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A forest in [Ainumarya](<../chasa-nahadi-watershed/ainumarya.md>), the Chasa-Nahadi Watershed  
</div>


A cursed forest, once home to many Deno'qai. The scene of many battles during the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), and now haunted by the dead. Not a safe place to travel, for the restless dead swarm the living who enter the forest and remain still for more than a few hours. Many early battles in the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) were fought here. 

On the western border of the territory of the Ko'zula Deno'qai tribe.

The broad, flat terrain stretching from the [Yuvanti Mountains](<./yuvanti-mountains.md>) west to the [Nevos Sea](<../west-coast/nevos-sea.md>). A humid, tropical region, with a climate dominated by the annual monsoons that cause the rivers to flood. 

The city of [Nayahar](<realms/dunmar/western-dunmar/nayahar.md>) is the largest settlement in this region.

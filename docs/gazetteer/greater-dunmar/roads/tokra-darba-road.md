# The Tokra-Darba Road
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A road in [Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


A Dunmari road that runs from the [~Crossroads Caravanserai~](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/crossroads-caravanserai.md>), northwest of [Tokra](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), through the [Copper Hills](<../darba-highlands/copper-hills.md>), until it joins the [~Darba-Songara Road~](<./darba-songara-road.md>) northeast of [Darba](<../realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>). This road has seen better days: it is dusty and dry in the summer, and muddy during the monsoon. Nonetheless, for much of its length there are maintained way stations, and well-stocked caravanserai, spaced a day's journey apart. The only truly rough spot is the 60 miles or so where the road passes through the rocky outcroppings of the [Copper Hills](<../darba-highlands/copper-hills.md>), where there are no inns or way stations.

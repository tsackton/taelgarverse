# The Stoneway
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A road in [Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>




The Stoneway is the Dunmari name for the ancient Drankorian road that once connected [Chardon](<../../west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) and [Isingue](<../../istaros-watershed/isingue.md>). It is wide enough for two wagons to pass, paved with massive, smooth stones, with drainage ditches on both sides for almost its entire length. It is heavily traveled for much of its length and serves as a key linkage between [Karawa](<../realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) and [Eastern Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>), [Tokra](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), and [Songara](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/songara.md>), especially during the monsoons when mud and rain can make passage overland across the plains difficult at times. 

Since the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) the upheavals that followed, much of the road east of [Gomat](<../dunmari-basin/gomat.md>) is in ruins: the [Daraar Canyon](<../dunmari-basin/daraar-canyon.md>) cuts across the path of the Stoneway, and beyond it is in poor repair. 


About halfway between Tokra and Karawa, a three-mile segment of an old Drankorian aqueduct still exists, carrying a faded enchantment that amplifies the volume of water flowing over it. While it cannot create water out of thin air, a gallon of water poured into the aqueduct will grow to two gallons as it travels. 

[Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) built [earthen berm along these ruins](<../../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-33-dufr.md>), to make access easier, so Dunmari can use as a mini-oasis.

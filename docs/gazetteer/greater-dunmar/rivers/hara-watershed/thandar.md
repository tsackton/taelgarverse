# Thandar
:speaker:{ .middle } *(t-HAHN-dur)*  
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the Hara Watershed, the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


The Thandar flows about 240 miles from its source in the Sentinels to its confluence with the Hara on the [~North Tokra Plains~](<../../dunmari-basin/north-tokra-plains.md>). The upper reaches of the Thandar are swift flowing and marked by rapids and gorges as the river cascades from the steep slopes of the Sentinels to the plains below. 

As the Thandar enters the flat plains of the Dunmari basin, it winds slowly southwest across the eastern edge of the ~Songara Plains~. 

Near the confluence with the Hara stands a [massive statue of stoneborn warrior](<../../dunmari-basin/stoneborn-statue-dungeon.md>), of ancient and unknown construction.

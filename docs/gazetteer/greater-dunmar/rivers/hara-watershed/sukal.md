The Sukal is a meandering river that flows from the Darba Highlands east, joining the [Hara](<./hara.md>) on the arid [~Southern Tokra Plains~](<../../dunmari-basin/southern-tokra-plains.md>). During the dry winter months, the Sukal is often little more than a trickle, but when the monsoon rains fall on the Darba Highlands it bursts to life.

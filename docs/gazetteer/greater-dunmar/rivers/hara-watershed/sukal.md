# Sukal
:speaker:{ .middle } *(su-KAHL)*  
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the [Hara Watershed](<./hara-watershed.md>), the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


The Sukal is a meandering river that flows from the [Darba Highlands](<../../darba-highlands/darba-highlands.md>) east, joining the [Hara](<./hara.md>) on the arid [~Southern Tokra Plains~](<../../dunmari-basin/southern-tokra-plains.md>). During the dry winter months, the Sukal is often little more than a trickle, but when the monsoon rains fall on the [Darba Highlands](<../../darba-highlands/darba-highlands.md>) it bursts to life.

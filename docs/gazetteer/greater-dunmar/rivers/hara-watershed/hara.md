<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the Hara Watershed, the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


The Hara flows 750 miles through the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), from its source in the foothills of the [Sentinel Range](<../../../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) to the [~Hara River Gorge~](<../../dunmari-basin/hara-river-gorge.md>). Once, it flowed more than twice that length in total, joining the [Istaros](<../../../istaros-watershed/rivers/istaros.md>) north of [Drankor](<../../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>). Whether it still does after the cataclysms and upheavals following the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), no one knows.

At its source, the Hara is a swift flowing mountain river, descending to the  flat plains of the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>). As the Hara enters the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), it slows and widens as it meanders south towards [Tokra](<../../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), joined first by the [Sone](<./sone.md>) and then by the [Thandar](<./thandar.md>), along with several minor tributaries. 

South of the confluence with the [Thandar](<./thandar.md>), the Hara turns broad and sluggish as it flows through the [~North Tokra Plains~](<../../dunmari-basin/north-tokra-plains.md>). Here, the Hara frequently floods during the monsoon season. 

The region in the immediate vicinity of [Tokra](<../../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) is rocky and hard, especially just south of the city, where the rocky land of the [Darba Highlands](<../../darba-highlands/darba-highlands.md>) protrudes into the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>). Here, the river widens again as it passes beneath the ~Tokra Bridge~. 

South of [Tokra](<../../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), the river passes through a series of small canyons on the rugged [~Southern Tokra Plains~](<../../dunmari-basin/southern-tokra-plains.md>). The [Sukal](<./sukal.md>) joins between [Tokra](<../../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) and [Askandi](<../../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/askandi.md>), and a number of dry washes and seasonal rivers flow into the Hara in this stretch during the monsoon. 

Just north of [Askandi](<../../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/askandi.md>), the terrain levels, and the Hara pursues a slow, twisting path southeast. [Askandi](<../../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/askandi.md>) sits on the floodplains of the [~Lower Hara Valley~](<../../dunmari-basin/lower-hara-valley.md>), a wide flat basin between the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>) and the [Garamjala](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) Plateau. Here, virtually no rain falls, even during the monsoon, but the flood of the Hara, swollen from monsoon rains to the north, sustains a rich riparian ecosystem and the city of [Askandi](<../../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/askandi.md>) itself. 

Beyond [Askandi](<../../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/askandi.md>), the land begins to rise again as the [Garamjala](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) Plateau joins the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>). This is a land of dry desert canyons, as the Hara narrows again as it cuts through the highlands via the [~Hara River Gorge~](<../../dunmari-basin/hara-river-gorge.md>). 

Beyond the [~Hara River Gorge~](<../../dunmari-basin/hara-river-gorge.md>), no one knows the fate of the river. Does it feed a seasonal lake in the depths of the [Garamjala](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>)? Does it flow all the way through the plateau to join the [Istaros](<../../../istaros-watershed/rivers/istaros.md>), as it once did? Or does something stranger happen?
## In Dunmari Culture

The Hara is a central river of Dunmari myth and culture. Before the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), when the Dunmari settled in this land, the two great rivers of the Hara and the [Kharja](<../../../istaros-watershed/rivers/kharja.md>), collectively known as Jeevali's Tears, provided water and sustenance to much of the people of the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>). Before the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>) and the [Garamjala](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) Plateau were raised, these rivers were separated only by the high land around [Karawa](<../../realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), and the monsoons swept across the entire plains, supporting a rich grassland ecosystem.

Since the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the [Kharja](<../../../istaros-watershed/rivers/kharja.md>) has nearly or completely dried up. None have traced its route into the [Garamjala](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>), but even near [Kharsan](<../../dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) it flows only fitfully, in sudden floods after rare storms, and it is presumed it no longer meets the Hara. 

The Hara has thus taken on greater significance for the Dunmari. Without it, life would not be possible in the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>).

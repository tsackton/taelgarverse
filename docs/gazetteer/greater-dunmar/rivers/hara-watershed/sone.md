# Sone
:speaker:{ .middle } *(SO-nay)*  
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the Hara Watershed, the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


The Sone is a broad, winding river that flows about 380 miles east from its source in the [Chataan Mountains](<../../../greater-chardon/chataan-mountains.md>), across the [~Songara Plains~](<../../dunmari-basin/songara-plains.md>), to its confluence with the [Hara](<./hara.md>). During the drier months, from November to April, the Sone is a slow, sluggish river. Its outflow increases dramatically during the monsoon, fed by the rains that fall on the [~Songara Plains~](<../../dunmari-basin/songara-plains.md>).

The Sone is a broad, winding river that flows about 380 miles east from its source in the ~Darba Coastal Mountains~, across the ~Songara Plains~, to its confluence with the [Hara](<./hara.md>). During the drier months, from November to April, the Sone is a slow, sluggish river. Its outflow increases dramatically during the monsoon, fed by the rains that fall on the ~Songara Plains~.

# Western Dunmar

</div>


Western Dunmar is a productive agricultural region, occupying the flat lands of the [Nayan Floodplains](<../../../nayan-floodplains.md>), west of the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../../yuvanti-mountains.md>) and east of the [Nevos Sea](<../../../../west-coast/nevos-sea.md>). The densest settlement is in the Nayan river valley, which contains the largest city in the region, [Nayahar](<./nayahar.md>), which also serves as the administrative center and Samraat court of [Dunmar](<../dunmar.md>). 

This is a land of savannas and rice paddies, small villages and semi-nomadic pastoralists, with strongly seasonal rainfall peaking during the summer monsoon, followed by a cool, sometimes foggy winter and a brutally hot, dry season leading up to the monsoon.

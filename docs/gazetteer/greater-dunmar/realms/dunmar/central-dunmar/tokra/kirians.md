# Kirian’s
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } An inn in [Tokra](<./tokra.md>), [Central Dunmar](<../central-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../../dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


A substantial, three-story inn near the main market square. One of the few inns in town, and fairly elegant. Caters strongly to merchants and the wealthy, and especially Chardonians and other foreigners. Dunmari tend to camp outside, or stay at [Darshana's Caravanserai](<./darshana-s-caravanserai.md>). Run by [Kirian](<../../../../../../people/dunmari/kirian.md>), a retired Dunmari solider from the west. 

3 gp/day for party for decent rooms and plain food.

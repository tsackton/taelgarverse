# Tokra
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A city in [Central Dunmar](<../central-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../../dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


*As you crest the height of the land, you can see the River [Hara](<../../../../rivers/hara-watershed/hara.md>) winding slowly from north to south, barely more than a trickle at this time of year, before the rains of the monsoon season come.

*The city of Tokra lies just beyond the river, on the other side of a huge arching bridge of solid gray stone. The bridge is worn and has seen better days: decorative pillars that once lined the crossing are clearly missing, and only on the far side of the river have they been replaced by statues of two rearing horses with flowing manes.*

*Stretching north of the city, along the river, is a small dockyard, now mostly quiet in the dry heat of late summer. Beyond, fields of summer season crops, mostly bitter melon and watermelon, await the harvest with the monsoon rains.

*The city itself is surrounded by a solid, thick wall of stone, with several striking gates. A scattering of buildings stand outside the walls, mostly inns and merchant houses, but also including a small halfling neighborhood near the river.**

*While much of the city is hidden behind the walls, three large buildings dominate the skyline. The dome of a large temple rises in the center of town, presumably the main temple of [Five Siblings](<../../../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>) in Tokra, and also the center of the civil adminstration of the city. Near the temple, two other buildings, both tinged with Dwarven architectural elements stand. Rising over all the buildings in Tokra is a great tree, hundreds of feet tall and seemingly made of stone. 

*To the south, the land rises in a series of small hills, with the [Lakan Monastery](<./lakan-monastery.md>) visible on a hill overlooking the city and the river, perhaps five miles south of Tokra.

### Markets

There are three major markets in Tokra, each based in an open plaza.

The River Market, to the east, is the smallest, and functions mostly as a daily market for food and sundries for locals, operating roughly 8am - 11 am every day.

The Trader's Market, to the west, is the largest market and the most exotic. Operates three days a week, and is a major source of civic revenue as it costs money to set up a stall here. This is where booksellers, potion makers, other exotic wares, and goods from [Chardon](<../../../../../west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), [Sembara](<../../../../../greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), and beyond are sold. One addtiional day a week, this serves as an animal market.

The City Market, south of [Jita](<../../../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/jita.md>)'s square, is located in the midst of the artisan's quarter, and is lined with small shops, especially local artisans, smiths, etc. A weekly market brings various high-end goods for sale here. But regularly active with artisanal shops even when market is not operating.

### Jita's Square

The large, central plaza on which the temple, [Archives](<./archives.md>), and palace sit is known as [Jita](<../../../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/jita.md>)'s Square. In the center of the plaza is a statue/fountain of [Jita](<../../../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/jita.md>) riding a horse, [Chidya](<../../../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/chidya.md>) standing in front with her hands raised, guiding [Jita](<../../../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/jita.md>).

### Temple

The temple is the largest building in Tokra, topped with a large dome that rises 300 feet into the sky, towered over the nearby buildings, even the palace and the [Archives](<./archives.md>).

Actually a temple complex. The main worship space is a pentagonal space beneath the dome, with significant altars to [Five Siblings](<../../../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>). There is also an entryway area, and private prayer space, clerical offices, and storerooms in the upper floors and the basement levels.

Attached to the temple is a major administrative complex, where acolytes manage funds, taxes, census data, and service obligations for eastern [Dunmar](<../../dunmar.md>), technically now from [Songara](<../songara.md>) to Tokra.

The temple was constructed during the early years of the Dharajun dynasty, and shares the grand, almost ostentatious, architectural style that characterized the first part of the Dharajun years. Horse motifs are frequent, as is mosaic designs, and few surfaces are left undecorated.

### Palace 

The palace is a large rectangular building with a large central courtyard, originally constructed at the same time as the [Archives](<./archives.md>) for the use of the traveling court of the Darajun dynastic court. During the [Great War](<../../../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), this was used as the headquarters of the western army of the Dunmari, coordinating defenses against the eldritch horrors in the mountains to the north. During this time it was expanded and used as a barracks as well, so it is a bit of a clash of architectural styles, with a older "Dharajunic" building and a newer more utilitarian design.

During the [Fire War](<../../../../../../events/1500s/fire-war.md>) it was damaged, but not as badly as the [Archives](<./archives.md>), and required only cosmetic repairs, which were done in a Dwarvish style.



### History

Tokra was originally the site of a Drankorian settlement, a river crossing and trade post associated with a pair of forts guarding [extraplanar weak points](<../../../../../../cosmology/multiverse/extraplanar-weak-point.md>) to the north and south. After the [First Plague](<../../../../../../events/1000s/1059/first-plague.md>) and the Settlement of Dunmar, was resettled by the Dunmari but remained little more than a small village associated with the monastery, until Tokra became the center of administration of the Dharajun. After surviving the [Great War](<../../../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) relatively unscathed, Tokra was severely damaged in the [Fire War](<../../../../../../events/1500s/fire-war.md>), but rebuilt and became a notable center of administration during the Nayan dynasty.

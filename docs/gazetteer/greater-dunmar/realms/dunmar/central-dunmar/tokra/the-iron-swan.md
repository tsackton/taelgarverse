>[!info]+ Information

>> 

A dwarven tavern, towards the northern part of town, in the (small) dwarven quarters behind the [Archives](<./archives.md>). Has a few rooms reserved for traveling dwarves; otherwise, exclusively a tavern. Dark, cramped, interior, but serves great beer. Run by [Vistra Fireforge](<../../../../../../people/dwarves/vistra-fireforge.md>), a retired mercenary / adventurer.

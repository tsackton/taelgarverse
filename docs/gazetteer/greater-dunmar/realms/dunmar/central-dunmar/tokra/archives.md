The Tokra Archives are located in a large square building with a significant tower rising 100 feet above the city, across the Dharajun Plaza from the Temple of Tokra. First constructed during the early years of the [Dharajun dynasty](<../../../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/dharajun-dynasty.md>), the Archives suffered significant damage during the [Fire War](<../../../../../../events/1500s/fire-war.md>), and was extensively reconstructed in the the simpler, less ostentatious, more flowing, melancholic, and organic style of post-Great-War [Dunmari Architecture](<../../dunmari-architecture.md>). 

The Archives primarily hold historical records from the [Dharajun dynasty](<../../../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/dharajun-dynasty.md>), with a focus on military and religious records; they are also the major location of records of the eastern army of [Dunmar](<../../dunmar.md>) during the [Nayan Dynasty](<../../../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/nayan-dynasty.md>). In the Archives is also some contemporary scholarship, largely relating to religious matters and the [Nayan Dynasty](<../../../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/nayan-dynasty.md>); contemporary religious and civil administration records are kept in the smaller archives of the Temple of Tokra. Smaller holdings in the Archives include books on ancient history, especially Drankorian history, and collected records of the [Great War](<../../../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) assembled by archivists in the years after [Mavdyr](<../../../../../../people/historical-figures/mavdyr.md>)'s invasion and the [Fire War](<../../../../../../events/1500s/fire-war.md>).

Access to the archives is restricted. Formally, permission is required from the Head Priest of [Tokra](<./tokra.md>), the highest civil authority in the city, but in practice the Chief Archivist manages access to the records stored within.

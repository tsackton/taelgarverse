# The Red Lily Inn
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [halfling](<../../../../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/halflings/halflings.md>) inn in [Tokra](<./tokra.md>), [Central Dunmar](<../central-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../../dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


A halfling inn, also on the west side of town, just inside the walls, near the western gate. Run by [Wes Strongbones](<../../../../../../people/halflings/wes-strongbones.md>) and his twin sons Tye and Cade. 

A cozy, comfortable place, with about 10 halfing sized rooms and another 20 human sized ones, plus a bunk room and stables, and a renowned kitchen. Mostly a merchant / out of town crowd, though.

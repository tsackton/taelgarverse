A caravanserai at the crossroads of the [Stoneway](<../../../roads/stoneway.md>) and the [Tokra-Darba Road](<../../../roads/tokra-darba-road.md>). It is often a busy place with travelers, and a good place to collect information. One of the larger caravanserai between [Tokra](<tokra/tokra.md>) and [Songara](<./songara.md>) along the [Stoneway](<../../../roads/stoneway.md>), with what amounts to a small village around the caravanserai structure itself. During in the months after the monsoon, when the grass in the surrounding plains is lush, grows to a few hundred people or more, but empties out during the heat of summer.

-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Dunmari](<../dunmar.md>) abandoned village in the [Copper Hills](<../../../darba-highlands/copper-hills.md>), [Central Dunmar](<./central-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


An abandoned mining village in the [Copper Hills](<../../../darba-highlands/copper-hills.md>). The village is set in the hills, on a bit of a rise. While most of the town is just ruins, the temple of the [Five Siblings](<../../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>), on a larger hill, is still mostly intact, albeit completely looted of any valuables. A short walk from the village is a flooded copper mine shaft.

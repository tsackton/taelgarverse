-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A city in [Central Dunmar](<./central-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


Songara is the westernmost city in [Dunmar](<../dunmar.md>), on the [Stoneway](<../../../roads/stoneway.md>) near the [Myraeni Gap](<../../../myraeni-gap.md>) and the tradition western boundary of the realm of [Dunmar](<../dunmar.md>). 

Songara is located in the productive [~Songara Plains~](<../../../dunmari-basin/songara-plains.md>) on the western edge of the [Dunmari Basin](<../../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), on the fertile plains on the north bank of the [Sone](<../../../rivers/hara-watershed/sone.md>). It is a major center of animal husbandry and horse rearing in Dunmar, and historically grew around the ancient horse markets. Relatively untouched by the upheavals after the [Great War](<../../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), Songara is among the oldest extant Dunmari cities. It was a major power center of the [Dharajun Dynasty](<../../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/dharajun-dynasty.md>), strongly associated with [Jita](<../../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/jita.md>), the founder of that dynasty. 

Songara's economy is based on trade, but it has seen its wealth and power diminish with the growth of the [Darba](<../coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>)-[Chardon](<../../../../west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) oceanic trade. The decline in cross-Dunmar traffic, and the concomitant decline in [tithes paid by travelers](<../dunmari-economy.md#land-ownership>) for the favor of the [Dunmari gods](<../../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>), has also had a significant impact on Songara's economy. However, Songara remains the center of the breeding, rearing, and trade of the famous Dunmari horses, with thriving horse markets.

# The Economy of Dunmar

Dunmar is a society of largely nomadic animal herders in the arid grasslands and deserts of the east, but increasingly a rich agricultural society in the west, on the fertile Nayan Floodplains.

Historically, Dunmar grew rich in large part off the profits of trade, given that a large portion of the east-west overland trade passed through Dunmari territory prior to the Great War. In addition to trade, a highly efficient message service was once famous across Taelgar. 

In the current day, Dunmar is largely known for horses; animal products, including fine leather and raw wool; tropical hardwoods from the Shrev river valley and beyond; and agricultural products of the Nayan Floodplains.
## Trade

Dunmar is not completely isolated from its neighbors. Although not a significant maritime power, a considerable amount of trade passes through Darba, the richest city in Dunmar. In addition to agricultural products, considerable dwarven trade passes through Dunmar between the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>) and the [Chardonian Empire](<../../../west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>). 

Trade from the Green Sea to the east usually comes via halfling caravans out of Sembara, that cross the passes of the Sentinels in season. 

The message system is largely extinct now, but fast messages still run from Askandi -~ Tokra -~ Songara, and Nayahar -~ Darba -~ Tokra; the latter is more efficient as it still has full official support and stocked waystations
### Coins

Coins are not commonly used in the current day in Eastern Dunmar, as much trade is conducted in barter and in kind. Coins are minted in Nayahar, however, and these are in occasional use in the east.

Gold coins (worth 1 gp) are known as steeds; silver coins as rupas, and copper coins as taams.

Older coins from pre-Blood Years uses the same names, but tended to be larger and more pure, and so can trade for more than their 'face value'


  
Dwarven coins are in common usage in Dunmar as well, as ar dwarven trade bars, stamped with a known weight of silver or gold, which are commonly used for large transactions.
## Taxes

In addition to the obligations of tithe and service that run through the temple system, other revenue sources provide money for the Dunmari state. 

The Dunmari hold that all land in Dunmar is owned by the gods. While most land is held in common for pasture, herding, and hunting, some land in cities and towns, as well as agricultural land where it can be supported, may be leased. The rents from these leases, typically collected in the form of a fraction of the profits of the land, flow to the temple that controls the land in that region, and are used to fund local needs, for defense, roads, and other needs. 

Traditionally, because the land is owned by the gods, passage across it is free and unencumbered, accounted for in the tithe for common lands. In better days, temples at border crossings would collect tithes from travelers so the gods would keep them safe on their journeys, but many of these have fallen into disrepair and have been abandoned, especially in the east. But in the former days of Dunmar, this was a major source of revenue for the Samraat. 

Many towns also impose market taxes or sales taxes, or maintain monopolies on certain goods. 

The mystery cults derive revenue from specific monopolies they are granted, as well as rents on land they control. All mystery cults have specific monopolies on the sale and provision of particular magical goods and services, and many also have rights to particular other monopolies in their area. In regions with both a mystery cult and a temple, the distribution of rents between them can be a tricky political issue, and there are usually founding charters that delineate rents owed. Some mystery cults which are isolated and far from settlements are largely self-sufficient, providing their own food and defense and acquiring occasional additional goods by bartering whatever they produce.

Shakun's Wellspring is a sacred grove on the southern edge of the [Red Mesa](<./red-mesa.md>), a place of peace and tranquility and a place to commune with [Shakun](<../../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>). Shakun's Wellspring is a hidden grove in the south of the [Red Mesa](<./red-mesa.md>), of old, gnarled trees that seem out of place in the desert. During the day, it is nothing, really, and has no particular power, but at night a clear pool appears in the middle of the trees, that reflects not just stars but other planes as well. Shakun herself is said to appear sometimes.

The pool leads to [Shakun's Realm](<../../../../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/shakun-s-realm.md>), a demi-plane of the divine controlled by [Shakun](<../../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>).

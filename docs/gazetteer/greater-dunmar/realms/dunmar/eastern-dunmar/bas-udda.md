-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village [Eastern Dunmar](<./eastern-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


A small village on the eastern side of the [Red Mesa](<./red-mesa.md>), in the [~Karawa Desert~](<../../../dunmari-basin/karawa-desert.md>), originally settled in the aftermath of the [Great War](<../../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). Like many other villages of [Eastern Dunmar](<./eastern-dunmar.md>), such as [Karawa](<./karawa.md>), Bas Udda sits on an oasis, which forms a large underground aquifer and provides water for a number of hardy, drought resistance crops that grow here. The village itself is centered on the large Temple of the Siblings that provides an architectural anchor for the town. 


In the summer of DR 1748, the village of Bas Udda was destroyed during the gnoll raids. Nearly the entire village burned, and few structures were left standing. Only the Temple of the Siblings survived the destruction even partially intact. The entire population fled or was massacred, and the village was abandoned. 



After the rains, in the winter of DR 1748, people began to rebuild, as refugees returned to their homes and land. Although there was much destruction, a new village is now beginning to rise from the ashes of the old.

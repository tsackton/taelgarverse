# Eastern Dunmar
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A subregion in [Dunmar](<../dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


Eastern Dunmar is marginal land centered on the [Red Mesa](<./red-mesa.md>) and the towns that surround it, principally [Karawa](<./karawa.md>) and [Bas Udda](<./bas-udda.md>). Once, this was the heart of Dunmar, but in the current day, it is a sparsely populated scrubland and desert.

Eastern Dunmar remains a highly significant religious site, however. The [Shakun Mystai](<../../../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/shakun-mystai.md>) are based at the [Temple of Shakun](<./temple-of-shakun.md>) in [Karawa](<./karawa.md>), and a number of holy sites significant to [Shakun](<../../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>) are here, including [Shakunâ€™s Wellspring](<./shakuns-wellspring.md>) and the [Red Mesa](<./red-mesa.md>). 

The densest settlement in this area, outside the villages of the [Red Mesa](<./red-mesa.md>), is on the northern plains north and east of the [Gomat Oasis](<../../../dunmari-basin/gomat.md>), known as the [Samtal](<../../../dunmari-basin/samtal.md>). This region gets more rain than the ~Karawa Desert~ and supports nomadic grazing and herding, largely of sheep and goats.

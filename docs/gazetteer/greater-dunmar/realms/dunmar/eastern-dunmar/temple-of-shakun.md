# The Temple of Shakun

A large, imposing structure carved out of the side of the red standstone mesa on the southern part of town. The temple itself stretches at least partially into the cliff itself, but you have never been in that part of the structure. Non-initiates are only allowed access to a few outbuildings, and to the chapel to Shakun facing the oasis. The chapel is beautiful - polished sandstone floors, and tile mosaics abound - but is a place primarily for prayer and does not seem to hold any secrets. The Mystai of Shakun do, however, sell and barter dusts and powders that are known to possess magical properties. The temple, strangely, seems more weathered and aged than the rock of the mesa itself.

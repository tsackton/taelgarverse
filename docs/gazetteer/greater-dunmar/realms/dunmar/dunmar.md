</div>


Dunmar is an ancient theocratic monarchy stretching more than 700 miles across the central lowlands of ~Northern Continent~, bordered by the coast of the [Nevos Sea](<../../../west-coast/nevos-sea.md>) and the [Myraeni Gap](<../../myraeni-gap.md>) in the west, the [Sentinel Range](<../../../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) in the north, and the  barren wastelands of the [Nashtkar](<../../dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>) and the [Garamjala Desert](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) in the east and south. Founded in DR 1173 by the great leader and first Samraat [Bhishma](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/bhishma.md>), who is now a goddess and a divine protector of her people, Dunmar survived the turmoil of the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and the upheavals that followed, and now occupies a land much-changed from the fertile grasslands of its founding.

Dunmar was founded on the territory that was formerly the heartland of the [Drankorian Empire](<../../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), but left largely, although not entirely, empty by the [First Plague](<../../../../events/1000s/1059/first-plague.md>). The palace and administrative center of the [Aatmaji Dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/aatmaji-dynasty.md>), the founding dynasty of Dunmar, was [Kharsan](<../../dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) and the [Kharja](<../../../istaros-watershed/rivers/kharja.md>) river valley. When the [Aatmaji Dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/aatmaji-dynasty.md>) was ended after a disastrous attempt to invade and cleanse [Drankor](<../../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), after a short period of chaos, the political and cultural center of the country moved west under the [Dharajun Dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/dharajun-dynasty.md>), to the city of [Tokra](<central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>). Dunmar reached its peak of power and influence during this time, thanks in part to its agricultural wealth (largely in horses and sheep) and overland trade network connecting the east and west. 

During the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), however, Dunmar suffered terribly. The [Dharajun Dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/dharajun-dynasty.md>) was destroyed, many Dunmari died in battle against [Cha'mutte](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s armies, and the eastern part of the country was destroyed. After [Cha'mutte](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s defeat, the land itself was reshaped: the [Garamjala Plateau](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-plateau.md>) and the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>) rose violently and suddenly, shifting the course of the [Mahar](<../../../istaros-watershed/rivers/istaros.md>) and creating the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>). Yet the Dunmari survived, and built a new country in the changed land. 

Now, Dunmar is culturally divided by the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>) and the [Darba Highlands](<../../darba-highlands/darba-highlands.md>). To the east, the Dunmari who live in the dry, arid grasslands and deserts of the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) maintain a traditional nomadic way of live, moving with their herds of horses, sheep, and goats across the plains with the seasons, and gathering at temples and religious sites to mark the festivals and turnings of the year. To the west, the people living on the coastal plains and in the river valleys and rolling hills of highlands have adopted a much more sedentary lifestyle, with a much greater focus on permanent agriculture. 

Nonetheless, the Dunmari remain united by their worship of the [Five Siblings](<../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>), the divinities that protect the people, and worship of these deities is a central part of all Dunmari culture and civic life. 

## Geography 

*See more: [Greater Dunmar Region](<../../greater-dunmar.md>)*

Dunmar is the largest and most significant populated realm in the [Greater Dunmar](<../../greater-dunmar.md>) region, covering nearly 400,000 square miles, although much of that territory is sparsely settled or uninhabited desert.  

On the western coast, the broad, flat [Nayan Floodplains](<../../nayan-floodplains.md>) stretch between the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>) and the [Nevos Sea](<../../../west-coast/nevos-sea.md>), a largely flat expanse of subtropical and tropical savannah. Further north, the rocky river valleys of the [Darba Highlands](<../../darba-highlands/darba-highlands.md>) stretch between the northern edge of the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>) and the [Chataan Mountains](<../../darba-highlands/chataan-mountains.md>). 

Inland, Dunmar is dominated by the [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), a flat depression surrounded by the [Copper Hills](<../../darba-highlands/copper-hills.md>), the [Chataan Mountains](<../../darba-highlands/chataan-mountains.md>), the [Myraeni Gap](<../../myraeni-gap.md>), the [Sentinel Range](<../../../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), and the high interior [Garamjala Plateau](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-plateau.md>), now extremely arid and primarily [desert](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>).

### Climate

Dunmar is a subtropical country, with hot, dry winters and hot, humid summers. The climate is strongly shaped by the seasonal monsoon rains, which bring moisture from the [Nevos Sea](<../../../west-coast/nevos-sea.md>) inland during the summer months, and the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>), which create a rain shadow over the Garamajala. 

The [Nayan Floodplains](<../../nayan-floodplains.md>) and the [Darba Highlands](<../../darba-highlands/darba-highlands.md>) generally are a subtropical humid monsoon climate, with extensive monsoon rains in June, July, August, and September, although the climate of the Darba Highlands tends to be moderated somewhat by the topography, which brings occasional winter rains off the ocean. The [Dunmari Basin](<../../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) is drier, with less overall rain and a shorter monsoon season. More rain falls in the west and north, and less in the south and east, so the richest grasslands tend to be the northwestern parts of Dunmar. The eastern and southern edges of the country are desert. 

### Regions

Although there are no formal administrative units within Dunmar larger than individual temple districts, conventionally Dunmar consists of four major regions.

- [Eastern Dunmar](<eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>), roughly the easternmost third of the country, contains the land around [Karawa](<eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) and the [Red Mesa](<eastern-dunmar/red-mesa.md>), and the fringes of settled land along the [Garamjala Desert](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>), as well as the more habitable [Samtal](<../../dunmari-basin/samtal.md>) north of the [~Karawa Desert~](<../../dunmari-basin/karawa-desert.md>).
- [Central Dunmar](<central-dunmar/central-dunmar.md>), the largest region by land area, is dominated by the Hara Watershed, and contains the important cities of [Tokra](<central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), [Askandi](<central-dunmar/askandi.md>), and [Songara](<central-dunmar/songara.md>), as well as the fertile grasslands of the [~Songara Plains~](<../../dunmari-basin/songara-plains.md>). 
- [Coastal Dunmar](<coastal-dunmar/coastal-dunmar.md>), the smallest and wealthiest region, is dominated by the port city of [Darba](<coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>) and the Rudhan, which flows through the [Darba Highlands](<../../darba-highlands/darba-highlands.md>). 
- [Western Dunmar](<western-dunmar/western-dunmar.md>), the administrative and political capital of the [Nayan Dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/nayan-dynasty.md>), and the most populous region of Dunmar, contains the city of [Nayahar](<western-dunmar/nayahar.md>) and the [Nayan Floodplains](<../../nayan-floodplains.md>).

Not part of Dunmar nor claimed by Dunmari rulers, but cutting through the territory of the realm, are the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>), home to the [dwarves](<../../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) of [Nardith](<../nardith/nardith.md>). 

### Borders

The southern and eastern borders of Dunmar are dangerous wildlands. To the south, the jungles south of the [Shrev](<../../rivers/shrev.md>) are home to strange monsters and the occasional undead, and extensive fortifications along the river keep the border safe. To the east, dangers of the the [Nashtkar](<../../dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>) and the vast [Garamjala Desert](<../../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>), part of the [Desolation of Cha'mutte](<../../../istaros-watershed/desolation-of-cha-mutte.md>), are kept from overrunning Dunmar by the divine grace of [Shakun's Protection](<../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/shakun-s-protection.md>) and the [Shakun Mystai](<../../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/shakun-mystai.md>). 

To the west, Dunmar is bordered by the [Nevos Sea](<../../../west-coast/nevos-sea.md>), the [Chataan Mountains](<../../darba-highlands/chataan-mountains.md>), and the [Myraeni Gap](<../../myraeni-gap.md>), beyond which lie the islands of [Illoria](<../../../west-coast/illoria.md>), and the [Chardonian Empire](<../../../west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>). 

To the north, the [Sentinel Range](<../../../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) forms the northern, and largely impassible, border of Dunmar, though several passes through the mountains made overland connections with the  [Greater Sembara](<../../../greater-sembara/greater-sembara.md>) region and the [Western Green Sea](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea.md>).

## History

Dunmar was founded in DR 1173, by a people from far to the east and south, who journeyed a long distance fleeing a great disruption in their homeland. Though the land they settled, what would become Dunmar, was ashy and cursed, a divine miracle healed the land for them to settle, and became the [founding myth](<../../../../primary-sources/founding-of-dunmar.md>) of the realm.

### Aatmaji Dynasty
DR 1173 - DR 1395

*See also: Timeline of the Aatmaji Dynasty*

The first Samraat of Dunmar, the blessed [Bhishma](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/bhishma.md>) who became a deity after her death, founded the ruling [Aatmaji dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/aatmaji-dynasty.md>), which ruled Dunmar for 212 years. During this time, [Kharsan](<../../dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) was the chief administrative headquarters of the realm, and the heartland of Dunmar was centered on the Khartja river valley. The greatest dangers that threatened the new kingdom came out of the swamps of [Drankor](<../../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), a cursed land still. The Aatmaji Dynasty ended when the Samraat Aatmaji [Dasa](<../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/dasa.md>), the last of the Aatmaji rulers attempted to invade [Drankor](<../../../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), and failed, disastrously, never to return. 

### Dharajun Dynasty
DR 1403 - DR 1545

*See also: Timeline of the Dharajun Dynasty*

The [Dharajun Dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/dharajun-dynasty.md>) was founded by Samraat Dharajun [Jita](<../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/jita.md>), a young woman from the [~Songara Plains~](<../../dunmari-basin/songara-plains.md>), skilled in battle and horsemanship. Uniting the Dunmari in the aftermath of the chaos that followed Dasa's defeat, Jita moved the administrative and religious center of the country to [Tokra](<central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), and ushered in a century of prosperity for the Dunmari. In the last years of the Dharajun Dynasty, the hobgoblin threat grew in the north, and extensive fortifications along the [Stoneway](<../../roads/stoneway.md>) and the [Sone](<../../rivers/hara-watershed/sone.md>) were constructed. The Dharajun Dynasty fell in the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), as Dunmar faced its greatest threat. 

### Nayan Dynasty
DR 1557 - 

*See also: Timeline of the Nayan Dynasty*

The [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) left Dunmar in chaos and the land changed, with much of the once-fertile heartlands of the country turned to arid, barren deserts, the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>) rising to the west, and the new lands of the [Nayan Floodplains](<../../nayan-floodplains.md>) emerging from the [Nevos Sea](<../../../west-coast/nevos-sea.md>). The [Nayan Dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/nayan-dynasty.md>) was founded in the west, establishing a new administrative center, [Nayahar](<western-dunmar/nayahar.md>), on the [Nayan](<../../rivers/nayan.md>) River, and slowly reclaims land as far east as the [~Karawa Desert~](<../../dunmari-basin/karawa-desert.md>). 

The first 50 years of the [Nayan Dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/nayan-dynasty.md>) was marked by a series of wars: 
- The [Fire War](<../../../../events/1500s/fire-war.md>), against the fire giant [Mavdyr](<../../../../people/historical-figures/mavdyr.md>) and his allies
- The [Bitter Knife War](<../../../../events/1500s/bitter-knife-war.md>), against the Bitter Knife hobgoblin nation based in the [Nashtkar](<../../dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>)
- The [Northern War](<../../../../events/1600s/northern-war.md>), against the [Blackened Claw](<../../../../groups/hobgoblin-clans/blackened-claw.md>) hobgoblin clan based in the [Samtal](<../../dunmari-basin/samtal.md>) and the upper reaches of the [Hara](<../../rivers/hara-watershed/hara.md>). 

At the end of the [Northern War](<../../../../events/1600s/northern-war.md>) in the 53rd year of the Nayan Dynasty (DR 1610), the hobgoblin threat from the [Desolation of Cha'mutte](<../../../istaros-watershed/desolation-of-cha-mutte.md>) was decisively defeated. Over the next 100 years, the attention of the Nayan Samraats largely turned to the lands around the [Shrev](<../../rivers/shrev.md>) and beyond, as repeated, unsuccessful attempts were made to clear the various magical dangers of the jungles beyond.

In the 161st year of the Nayan Dynasty (DR 1718), Samraat Nayan Lina came to power young, at a turbulent time, shortly after the [Summer of Red Storms](<../../../../events/1700s/1709/summer-of-red-storms.md>) and at a time of increasing dissent among the eastern temples. Her death in 171 Nayan (DR 1728) led to the [Nayan Succession Crisis](<../../../../events/1700s/nayan-succession-crisis.md>), which was eventually resolved by the ascension of Samraat Nayan Marathu to power the following year. 

Twelve years later, in 183 Nayan (DR 1740), Marathu was killed, along with a young woman named [Sura](<../../../../people/dunmari/sura.md>) who was widely seen as blessed by the gods and the obvious choice to succeed Marathu. Karnas, Sura's brother, is proclaimed Samraat [Nayan Karnas](<../../../../people/dunmari/nayan-karnas.md>) by the western temples in 183 Nayan (DR 1740), a move that was seen by many in the east as presumptuous and driven by political, not religious, considerations. 

In the 191st year of the Nayan Dynasty (DR 1748), Sura was freed from captivity by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>); she had been trapped in an extra-dimensional space in a magic mirror by the hag [Agata Dustmother](<../../../../people/fey/agata.md>). Sura's return triggered the [Sibling War](<../../../../events/1700s/sibling-war.md>).

## Life in Dunmar

### Culture

The Dunmari have long been a nomadic people, traditionally moving seasonally with their horses and herds, and only returning to permanent settlements and temples for major festivals. They are known for skill with animals, prowess in battle, and a close connection to their gods, the [Five Siblings](<../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>). The traditional focus of Dunmari settlement on religious, monumental, and administrative buildings has led to a variety of distinctive [Dunmari architectural styles](<./dunmari-architecture.md>). 

During the Nayan Dynasty, a more sedentary culture has developed on the fertile [Nayan Floodplains](<../../nayan-floodplains.md>) and [Darba Highlands](<../../darba-highlands/darba-highlands.md>). 

### Political Organization

*See more: [Dunmari Government](<./dunmari-government.md>)*

Dunmar is a theocratic monarchy, in which all power ultimately flows from the gods. The land of Dunmar itself is held in trust for the gods, and cannot be owned in a formal sense by mortals. The Samraat is the representative of the [Five Siblings](<../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>) on Taelgar, and is formally both the head of state and the head of the temple organization in Dunmar, which are traditionally considered the same office. 

Administratively, the Dunmari state is organized and run through temple districts. All Dunmari are members of a particular temple, a home region to return to for festivals and other significant religious events. It is through these temples that taxes and justice and other instruments of state operate. Indeed, Dunmar does not define itself by borders drawn on a map: to be part of the kingdom of Dunmar is to be part of a temple that acknowledges the supremacy of the Samraat.

While the Samraat is the supreme leader of the temple organization, there is little other formal hierarchy, and the head priests of each temple district are legally equal. Each head priest is also, by virtual of being a head priest, a member of the temple conclave, which also includes the speakers of the various mystical cults dedicated to specific divinities in Dunmar. The most important responsibility of the temple conclave is the election of the Samraat, which involves interpreting the divine will of the [Five Siblings](<../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>).

### Justice and the Law

In Dunmar, the law is religious law, and reflects the obligations of the community to the gods. Justice flows from the gods to the people. [Sonkar](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/sonkar.md>), in particular, is seen as the arbiter of justice, and many medium or large temples often have a specific priest dedicated to Sonkar who has the charge of deciding guilt or innocence. Interpretation of the will of the gods is key to justice, and minor miracles and divine magic are often crucial to this determination. 

The Samraat, as the supreme head of the temple, has the authority to overrule any decision of justice, and is themselves above mundane justice. 

Punishments in Dunmar rarely involve humiliation or pain, which is seen as cruel by the gods. Instead, they typically involve penance and restitution, which can include substantial fines or service obligations. More serious punishments include banishment, death, and excommunication. Excommunication, the most severe punishment possible, always involves the direct intervention of the gods themselves, as this ultimately condemns the soul of the perpetrator to dissolution.

### Religion

*See more: [Five Siblings of the Dunmari](<../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>)*

The Dunmari worship a close pantheon of deities, known as the [Five Siblings](<../../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>), as well as a small number of associated lesser divinities. Religion is closely intertwined with the Dunmari culture: indeed, to be Dunmari is to be in covenant with the Five Siblings, and vice versa. 

For most Dunmari, the yearly cycle of [Dunmari Festivals](<../../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/dunmari-festivals.md>) define their relationships to the gods. In particular, the major festivals of the year are typically celebrated at temples, and most Dunmari travel to their home temple for these occasions. Many Dunmari also carry with them shrines -- small icons and statuary of the gods, often carved or sculpted, that serve as a locus for prayer among a nomadic people. 

Outside of the normal temple organization are the [Dunmari Mystery Cults](<../../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/dunmari-mystery-cults.md>), mystical and magical secret organizations, each dedicated to one of the Dunmari gods.

### Magic
  
The Dunmari make little distinction between arcane, divine, and primal magic: all magic is ultimately considered to be the provenance of the gods. Nonetheless, the minor miracles of the gods associated with divine magic are by far the most common magical practice commonly seen among the Dunmari. 

Dunmari who display unusual magical talents or wish to seek other magical learning beyond channeling the miracles of the gods usually can only do so via the [Dunmari Mystery Cults](<../../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/dunmari-mystery-cults.md>). While the details are not reveled to outsiders, most of the mystery cults have associated magical traditions as well. For example, rumors persist that some initiates of the Chidyan mysteries can turn into animals.

In general, the practice of magic by those who are not priests or mystai is frowned upon, although not outright forbidden. Foreigners, including non-humans, usually an exception to this attitude. 

### Economy, Trade, and Foreign Relations

*See also: [Dunmari Economy](<./dunmari-economy.md>)*

Dunmar is largely agrarian, with an economy dominated by animal production. Dunmari horses are highly sought after, most notably, but the Dunmari are also known for leather products, wool, hides, and fur. Some seasonal crops are grown in the [Hara River Valley](<../../dunmari-basin/hara-river-valley.md>), as well as near the oases of the [Red Mesa](<eastern-dunmar/red-mesa.md>).

While historically Dunmar gained much wealth from its central position on trade routes between the east and west, since the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) minimal trade, mostly carried by long distance halfling caravans, moves from the [Green Sea](<../../../green-sea.md>) to [Chardon](<../../../west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>).  Nonetheless, Dunmar, especially [Darba](<coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>) and [Songara](<central-dunmar/songara.md>), remain important trading centers, with Darba serving as a link between the dwarves of [Ardith](<../../../sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>) and the west, and [Songara](<central-dunmar/songara.md>) retaining its ancient role as an important horse market. [Askandi](<central-dunmar/askandi.md>), in the south, is an important center of trade with the dwarves of the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>), who trade metal and finished metal products to the Dunmari. 

With trade connections to Chardon growing, the Nayan Floodplains have also begun to develop a significant timber industry, focused on sought-after tropical hardwoods.

# Nardith
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [dwarven](<../../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) realm in the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


The Kingdom of [Ardith](<../../../sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>) was once the great and prosperous southernmost kingdom in the central mountains, trading with the Dunmari, the people of the [Istabor Alliance](<../../../../history/istabor-alliance.md>), and even the mysterious Myraenians. However, during the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and the destruction that followed, this kingdom was entirely destroyed, and all that remains are ruins, lost mines, and forgotten roads in the deep.

Many of the people of [Ardith](<../../../sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>) fled south, crossing the Dunmari plains to settle in the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../yuvanti-mountains.md>), and founding the new kingdom of Nardith ("new [Ardith](<../../../sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>)"). The Yuvanti, newly risen from the plains of [Dunmar](<../dunmar/dunmar.md>), turned out to be easy to mine and full of mineral wealth, and the Kingdom of Nardith has grown prosperous over the past century, trading with [Dunmar](<../dunmar/dunmar.md>) and [Chardon](<../../../west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>).Â 

The Nardikhun, as the people of Nardith are called, bear the memories of the loss of their ancient homes and the flight across the open land, and many remain concerned with the fate of their lost heritage. But, the new land has been kind to them, and many have prospered with traditional Dwarven crafts of mining and smithing. Many Nardikhun have taken to exploring the deep hidden secrets of their new home and as such Travelers are common among the generation born in the Yuvanti.

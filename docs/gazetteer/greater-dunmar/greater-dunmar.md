<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A region [Taelgar](<../gazetteer.md>)  
</div>


This region of Taelgar includes the land south of the [Sentinel Range](<../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), from the [Myraeni Gap](<./myraeni-gap.md>) and the Dunmari coast in the west, past the [Garamjala Desert](<garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) and the [Nashtkar](<dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>) in the east to the unknown lands beyond the wastes. To the south, this region extends to the ruins of [Drankor](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>), and beyond to the [Sea of Storms](<./sea-of-storms.md>). 

This region experienced considerable upheaval after the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), as the [Yuvanti Mountains](<./yuvanti-mountains.md>) rose from the sea, creating the new land of [Western Dunmar](<realms/dunmar/western-dunmar/western-dunmar.md>), and turning the former fertile plains of the interior to desert. 

## Topography

The Central Lowlands region is dominated by four major topographical features. 
- The [Dunmari Basin](<dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) lies south of the Sentinels. This is a broad, flat plain, semi-arid, but with regular summer monsoons that bring rain and support expansive grassland. 
	- To the northwest, the [Dunmari Basin](<dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) is separated from the Yeraad watershed by the Myraeni Gap, a line of rugged hills between the Sentinels and the ~Darba Coastal Mountains~. 
	- To the west, the [Dunmari Basin](<dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) is separated from the Nevos Sea by the Darba Highlands extending from the [Copper Hills](<darba-highlands/copper-hills.md>), and the Yuvanti Mountains
	- To the north, the Sentinels form the edge of the basin; in the spring, snowmelt-fed streams and rivers bring life to the northern plains. 
	- To the east, the Garamjala Plateau, a high desert, separates the [Dunmari Basin](<dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) from the Istaros watershed. 
	- The only outflow from the [Dunmari Basin](<dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) is the ~Hara Gorge~, southeast of Askandi, that cuts through the rocky deserts on the western edge of the Garamjala Plateau. 
- The Yuvanti Mountains separate the [Dunmari Basin](<dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) from the Nevos Sea. Higher and more rugged in the south, the rain shadow of the Yuvanti Moutains creates the vast Garamjala Desert. 
	- At the northern edge of the Yuvanti Moutains, a series of hills and river valleys known as the Darba Highlands connects the Yuvanti to the ~Darba Coastal Mountains~, and isolates the [Dunmari Basin](<dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) from the Nevos. 
	- West of the Yuvanti, the broad, flat Nayan Floodplains stretch to the sea. 
- The Garamjala Plateau is an extremely arid mid-elevation plateau, that rises between the Hara and the Mahar watersheds. This area is almost entirely inhospitable desert.
- East and north of the Garamjala Plateau, the Istaros watershed runs from the foothills of the Sentinels near Sembara, through the Plaguelands, south into the Desolation of Cha'mutte and the fabled city of Drankor. 

## Climate

While historically the climate in this region was very different, in the current day this region is split between [hot arid desert and semi-arid scrub](https://geodiode.com/climate/hot-deserts), in the interior east of the [Yuvanti Mountains](<./yuvanti-mountains.md>),  and both [tropical](https://geodiode.com/climate/tropical-monsoon-and-tropical-savannah) and [subtropical](https://geodiode.com/climate/humid-subtropical) humid monsoon climates on the coast, especially in [Western Dunmar](<realms/dunmar/western-dunmar/western-dunmar.md>) between the [Yuvanti Mountains](<./yuvanti-mountains.md>) and the [Nevos Sea](<../west-coast/nevos-sea.md>).

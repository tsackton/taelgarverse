The Garamjala is a vast arid desert that stretches from the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../yuvanti-mountains.md>) to the eastern banks of the [Istaros](<../../istaros-watershed/rivers/istaros.md>), and beyond. It was formed in the aftermath of the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) as the upheavals in [Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) raised the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../yuvanti-mountains.md>) mountains, and lifted the central grasslands. As the rains stopped, the land turned dusty and rocky. 

The desert is now largely a landscape of rocky canyons, arid plateaus and rocks shaped by the wind, interspersed with open expanses of sandy dunes that bury lost cities. However, occasional rain does reach the desert during the monsoons, and rare thunderstorms cause the landscape to burst into bloom. The interior, east of the [Kharja](<../../istaros-watershed/rivers/kharja.md>) and west of the [Istaros](<../../istaros-watershed/rivers/istaros.md>), southwest of [Xurkhaz](<../../istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) is the driest and least hospitable, with miles of bare, cracked sand. The northwestern fringes, from [Kharsan](<../dunmari-basin/kharsan.md>) west to [Bas Udda](<../realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/bas-udda.md>) and [Karawa](<../realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), tend to be rockier and more likely to get occasional monsoon rain. 

## River Systems

Three major rivers run through the Garamjala. To the west, the [Hara](<../rivers/hara-watershed/hara.md>) drains the central Dunmari plains, entering the Garamjala southeast of [Askandi](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/askandi.md>). In the dry season, the [Hara](<../rivers/hara-watershed/hara.md>) flows quite sluggishly, but it swells during the monsoons on the plains. 



The [Kharja](<../../istaros-watershed/rivers/kharja.md>), once a mighty river, now is mostly dry, and only flows during the rainiest part of the season. It is suspected to peter out before reaching the confluence with the [Hara](<../rivers/hara-watershed/hara.md>), but few have mapped the [Desolation of Cha'mutte](<../../istaros-watershed/desolation-of-cha-mutte.md>) to know for sure. 



While the desert is mostly inhospitable, the [Istaros](<../../istaros-watershed/rivers/istaros.md>) drains an extensive region and flows year-round, supporting diverse riparian ecosystems, including the desert agriculture of the orcish kingdom of [Xurkhaz](<../../istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>). 

## Ecology

The desert supports little life. Nonetheless, the occasional giant vulture or band of ogres eke out a living amongst the rocks and sand, and desert-adapted axebeaks hunt small rodents in the more hospitable regions on the edges of the desert.

# The Copper Hills
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>

</div>


A small line of hills between [Tokra](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) and [Darba](<../realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>), once famous for copper mining but largely abandoned now.

Geographically, form the border between the Darba Highlands and the [Dunmari Basin](<../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), and are the source of the [Sukal](<../rivers/hara-watershed/sukal.md>) river.

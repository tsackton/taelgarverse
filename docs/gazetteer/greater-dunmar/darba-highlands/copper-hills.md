# The Copper Hills
>[!info]+ Information  
>   
>> 

A small line of hills between [Tokra](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) and [Darba](<../realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>), once famous for copper mining but largely abandoned now.

Geographically, form the border between the Darba Highlands and the [Dunmari Basin](<../dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), and are the source of the [Sukal](<../rivers/hara-watershed/sukal.md>) river.

# The ~North Tokra Plains~
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A grassland in [Central Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/central-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)  
</div>


The arid plains in the uppper Hara Watershed, north of the city of [Tokra](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>). This is a land of rolling hills, short grass, and few hills, except in rare riparian valleys. 

During the seasonal monsoon, the lands bursts to life, with small intermittent rivers springing awake and lush grass growing quickly. The land supports herds of antelope, axe beaks, and wild horses, which in turn are hunted by lions, wild dogs, and other more exotic predators.

# Dwarven Outpost (Raven's Hold)
>[!info]+ Information
> 
>> 

A dwarven fort and trading post in Raven's Hold. In better days, this was a major trading outpost, iron mine, and forge, serving as a point of communication and trade between the dwarves from the southern part of the central mountains and the Dunmari. While the Brawnanvils had a major presence here, numerous other clans either lived or spent time here, including the Strongaxe, Boulderbeard, Redpeak, and Deepcavern clans.

Abandoned during the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) when the dwarves here fled south in the face of mind flayer attacks.

# The Gomat Oasis
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } An oasis in [Eastern Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


A small oasis on the very eastern edge of [Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), about 40 miles east of [Karawa](<../realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). The oasis is a rocky area with a few bits of scrub, around a somewhat muddy open pool. Some trees provide a bit of shade, and the terrain to the north and west is more scrubland that pure desert. 

The oasis is frequently used as a temporary waystation by the Dunmari. Although there are no permanent habitation here, there are a few permanent structures -- a stone pen for animals, two wells, and a few mud and adobe shelters in the shade, as well as clear space for tents. 

A day's ride east from here is the [Daraar Canyon](<./daraar-canyon.md>), a massive, unnatural gash in the land, and the eastern edge of [Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>). Beyond the canyon rim, [Shakun's Protection](<../../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/shakun-s-protection.md>) ceases and [the desert](<./nashtkar.md>) becomes increasingly dangerous.

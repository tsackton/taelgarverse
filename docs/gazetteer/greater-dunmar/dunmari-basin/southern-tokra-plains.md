# The ~Southern Tokra Plains~
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A region in [Central Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/central-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../greater-dunmar.md>)

South of the city of [Tokra](<../realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>), the land grows increasingly arid, with little rain even during the monsoon season. The [Hara](<../rivers/hara-watershed/hara.md>) is the lifeblood of this land. 

To the west, the intermittent streams that flow from the Copper Hills, and the [Sukal](<../rivers/hara-watershed/sukal.md>), support a variety of drought-resistant plants, and provide grazing habitat in wide riparian valleys. To the east, the land turns to arid scrublands as it rises to meet the [Garamjala Plateau](<../garamjala-plateau/garamjala-plateau.md>).

# Agata's Lair

>> 

The home of the hag [Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>) Dustmother. Looted, but not destroyed, by the party in [Session 30 (DuFr)](<../../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-30-dufr.md>)

### Description

[Agata](<../../../people/fey/agata.md>)'s house is set on a hill, and is masked in illusion/planar magic so that you can only approach it from the north, via the path. If you circumnavigate the hill, the house will disappear, and the hill will be barren and dry.

The path leads up the slope through the scrubby, rocky ground, and follows a line of dead trees, dried out in the sun, but standing tall still, scraggly branches dripping with thorny vines. 

The hut itself is a plain dark brown mud hut, seemingly fairly shabbily made, with a large circular center room with a domed roof, and smoke rising from the chimney. A smaller extension come off the west side of the hut, also with a sloped mud roof. A wooden door, ajar, marks the entrance to the large circular room. 

Next to the house is a garden of thorns and rocks, tangled briars and such, but somehow, incongruously, a flock of hens is pecking in the dust of the garden. A stone wall surrounds it, and in the distance you can see a wooden scarecrow posed sitting on the wall watching over the chickens. A well sits towards the back of the garden.

Otherwise, the landscape is bleak, dusty, the barren rock only broken by the occasional dead tree, the cloudless sky only broken by the sight of a large bird circling high above. To the east about 100 feet is a small rocky outcrop stands, on top of which is a dense copse of dead trees.

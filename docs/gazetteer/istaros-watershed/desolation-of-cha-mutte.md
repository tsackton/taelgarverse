# The Desolation of Cha'mutte
>[!info]+ Information

>> 

The Desolation of Cha'mutte is a large area, spanning parts of the [Greater Dunmar](<../greater-dunmar/greater-dunmar.md>) and the [Western Green Sea Region](<../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>), that is magically corrupted as a result of the [First Plague](<../../events/1000s/1059/first-plague.md>) and the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). 

The Desolation of Cha'mutte includes:
- The area around the ruined city of [Drankor](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>) itself, destroyed during the chaos of the [First Plague](<../../events/1000s/1059/first-plague.md>), and now deeply cursed and unexplored.  
- The [Garamjala Desert](<../greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>), on a high, arid plateau spanning the [Kharja](<rivers/kharja.md>) and [Istaros](<rivers/istaros.md>) river valleys, and including the orc realm of [Xurkhaz](<xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>).
- The [Nashtkar](<../greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>), the blasted plains, north of the [Garamjala](<../greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) and east of [Dunmar](<../greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), a land of rocky canyons, twisted hills, and little water, on the western edge of the [Plaguelands](<./plaguelands.md>)
- The [Plaguelands](<./plaguelands.md>), in the Istaros Watershed, centered on the ruined city of [Isingue](<./isingue.md>).

While little of the desolation is readily habitable, the areas around the ruined cities of Drankor and Isingue are widely perceived as the most dangerous and cursed. The [Garamjala](<../greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>), which runs broadly west to east, well north of Drankor and well south of Isingue, is dry and hot but significantly less magically dangerous, and is home to a few brave or foolhardy souls.

Khumarz is a fortified border town that serves as a vital outpost for the kingdom of [Xurkhaz](<./xurkhaz.md>). Situated on the banks of the [Kulthul](<../rivers/kulthul.md>) River, it guards the western border of the kingdom against the dangers of the [Garamjala](<../../greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) and the [Desolation of Cha'mutte](<../desolation-of-cha-mutte.md>). The town is enclosed by high walls made of thick stone, with watchtowers strategically placed along the ramparts to provide a clear view of the surrounding wilderness. The gates of Khumarz are guarded by heavily armed [orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), ever-vigilant against any threat that might arise from the cursed land beyond. The town's buildings are simple and functional, designed for defense and survival rather than aesthetic appeal.

# Uzgukhar
>[!info]+ Information
> 
>> 

Uzgukhar is the capitol and primary city of the kingdom of [Xurkhaz](<./xurkhaz.md>), home of the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>). It is a desert city, nestled between the Kulthul and the [Istaros](<../rivers/istaros.md>) rivers, consisting largely of mud brick buildings decorated with colorful murals and intricate carvings. 
## Landmarks
Notable landmarks in Uzgukhar include the palace, a large cattle market, the plaza of freedom, and the hall of the ancestors. 

The palace, located near the center of the city and set on a small hill, has an elaborate public roof garden, with the throne room and apartments underground to provide relief from the heat. 

The hall of ancestors is a large, imposing structure made of sandstone, adorned with intricate carvings depicting both the ancient legends of the origin of the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>), and the founding of [Xurkhaz](<./xurkhaz.md>) under the leadership of [Uzgash](<../../../people/orcs/uzgash.md>). 

Outside the hall of ancestors is the Plaza of Freedom, the central public square of Uzgukhar. The plaza of freedom celebrates the refugees who kept the dream of the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) alive during the dark years when the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) was lost, and also includes a monument to all [orcs](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) that still suffer under [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s chains.

This region is a borderland, caught between the [Sentinel Range](<../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) to the west and the [Plaguelands](<./plaguelands.md>) to the east. It is a marginal land, with hot, dry summers when the ash-wind blows from the east and cold, dry winters when the westerlies blow over the mountains. The main rainfall is in the spring, when in lucky years several soaking rains will replenish the land, and in the summer when the punishing thunderstorms race from the east, bringing flash floods, lightning, and hail. In autumn the rivers shrink, and the temperature is briefly moderate before the cooler winters come.

Snow is rare, but sometimes a large winter storm will blanket the [Aurbez Plateau](<./aurbez-plateau.md>) for days, and the upper [Aursen](<rivers/aursen.md>) can freeze in particularly cold winters. The [Douren](<rivers/douren.md>), however, rushes too fast to freeze even in the coldest winters.

## Borders and Overview
The region is bordered by the [Plaguelands](<./plaguelands.md>) and the Darkwood in the east, the ~Gap of Mostreve~ and the ~Sentinel Range Spur~ in the north (which forms an informal and shifting border with the [Duchy of Maseau](<../greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>)), the [Sentinel Range](<../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) in the west, and the [Ardonne](<rivers/ardonne.md>) and [Douren](<rivers/douren.md>) rivers in the south. 

The land is lightly populated, but what people there are mostly live along the two rivers: the [Masance](<rivers/masance.md>) and the [Aursen](<rivers/aursen.md>). A significant road, the [Maseau - Dunmar Road](<../greater-sembara/roads/maseau-dunmar-road.md>) also runs through the region, providing a link between [Sembara](<../greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) and the west. Traffic along this road grows every year. 
   
In addition to these rivers, the land is divided into a highland and a lowland. A large plateau, the [Aurbez Plateau](<./aurbez-plateau.md>), stretches out from the mountain foothills from the just east of the headwaters of the [Masance](<rivers/masance.md>) to the headwaters of the [Douren](<rivers/douren.md>). This highland is gentler than the rest of the region, as the ash storms fall less strongly here, and there is marginally more rain, especially in the southern and western parts of the plateau, where aspens thrive amongst small streams and alpine meadows. The Aurbez plateau drops off rapidly to the east, and beyond the Masance the land flattens significantly into long scrubby grasslands, the Ardonne Plain. The soil here is marginal, but can support grazing, especially north of the [Ardonne](<rivers/ardonne.md>) where the plague ash lies less heavy on the land.

The region is divided into four areas, with different climate and politics.
## The Ardonne River
The land along the banks of the Ardonne and further south is largely a no-man’s land. The ash storms are fierce here, and at times the air can get too thick to breath easily. The Ardonne itself is corrupted and unsafe to drink, and crops do not grow on its banks. Before the Great War this region was a productive ranching land, and adventurers and treasure seekers occasionally venture into this land – in the winter, mostly, when the ash is less – to see what they can find. Some do not return.
## The Ardonne Plains
The central plains is the heartland of the [March of Ardonne](<../greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/march-of-ardonne.md>). Although the formal borders of the march are the [Ardonne river](<rivers/ardonne.md>), in practice most of the marcher lords establish fortified ranches in the central plains or along the [Maseau - Dunmar Road](<../greater-sembara/roads/maseau-dunmar-road.md>), where the ash storms are less intense. Cattle and goats are the main livelihood, as crops die too often in the ashy summers. Cattle can be brought inside the great fortified ranches when troubles come from the east and the marcher lords ride out to earn their stipends. The ranches along the road have grown into fortified rest-stops and places of refuge for travelers, and one does not need to camp in the open between [Cassons](<../greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/cassons.md>) and the crossing of the [Masance](<rivers/masance.md>). This is a land of scrubby grasses and small dryland trees.

### The Triangle and the Douren Valley
The land between the Dunmar Road, the Masance, and the Aursen is often referred to locally as the triangle, and is very similar to the Douren River Valley further south. These borderlands, along the Masance, Douren, and eastern Aursen rivers is a mix of marcher castles protecting small scale irrigation-driven farms, goat-and-sheep herders, and self-sufficient frontier farms that depend on hunting, fishing, small vegetable crops and ranching. Mostly claimed by no kingdom but many of the frontier farms are loyal to Aurbez, and the marcher lords are often loyal to Maseau. But the population density (perhaps no more than 2000 people in the whole region) is low enough that there is little conflict. This region is getting safer, and a popular recruiting ground for the Rangers.
### The Aurbez Plateau
The [Aurbez Plateau](<./aurbez-plateau.md>) rises sharply just north of the Dunmar Road, and is the heart of the [Refounded Alliance of Aurbez](<../greater-sembara/refounded-alliance-of-aurbez/refounded-alliance-of-aurbez.md>).

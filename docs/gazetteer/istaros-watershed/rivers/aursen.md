-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the [Istaros Watershed](<../istaros-watershed.md>)  
</div>


The Aursen starts in the foothills of the [Sentinel Range](<../../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) about 50 miles north of the headwaters of the [Douren](<./douren.md>). But in character and path, it is very different. The land here is flatter â€“ rocky and with poor soil, but studded with the occasional stand of pines, and the river flows gently and widely for 75 miles, before dropping in a series of large waterfalls off the plateau, to lower ground. The land around the Aursen is marshy and productive, although hard to farm. A small lizardfolk community has lived here since time immemorial, and they are much honored for the welcome and shelter they gave to the first refugees.

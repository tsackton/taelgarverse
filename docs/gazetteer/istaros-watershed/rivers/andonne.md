# The Andonne
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in [Greater Sembara](<../../greater-sembara/greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


The Andonne is formed by the confluence of the [Masance](<./masance.md>) and the [Aursen](<./aursen.md>), and flows for almost 300 miles until it joins the [Valmont](<./valmont.md>) at [Lake Aeulian](<./lake-aeulian.md>). The western quarter of the river runs swiftly with numerous rapids, until a particularly sequence of rapids and waterfalls known as the Washbasin. Since the Great War, the river, east of the Washbasin, has been ash-choked and corrupted, and unsafe to drink.

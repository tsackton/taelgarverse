# Valmont
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the [Istaros Watershed](<../istaros-watershed.md>)  
</div>


The Valmont flows south from [Addermarch](<../../greater-sembara/addermarch/addermarch.md>) and, with the [Andonne](<./andonne.md>), is one of the primary inflows to [Lake Aeulian](<./lake-aeulian.md>). It largely passes through uninhabited land, and forms part of the border of the [Darkwood](<../../greater-sembara/addermarch/darkwood.md>).

# Nidzahar
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [dwarven](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) realm in [Labkhan](<../sentinel-range.md>), [Central Highlands Region](<../central-highlands-region.md>)

Historically, Nidzahar, was a backwater, a minor kingdom of not much importance, which is even reflected in its name, which loosely translates simply as ‘east-land’. Nestled along the easternmost edge of the mountains and spreading into the lightly settled highlands of [Sembara](<../../greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), the Kingdom of Nidzahar was never particularly populous or prosperous. Lacking the mineral wealth of [Am'khazar](<./am-khazar.md>) and the trade connections of [Ardith](<./ardith.md>) or [Khatridun](<./khatridun.md>), before the war the kingdom of Nidzahar was of little importance, known largely as a place of iconoclasts, thinkers, and artisans. 

After the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the center of dwarven wealth and civilization in [Khatridun](<./khatridun.md>) and [Ardith](<./ardith.md>) fell, and Nidzahar attracted most of the trade with [Sembara](<../../greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) that remained, turning the raw mineral wealth of [Am'khazar](<./am-khazar.md>) to the west into armor, weapons, and stranger innovations. Now, Nidzahar is the largest and most technologically advanced of the five kingdoms.

-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [dwarven](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) realm in [Labkhan](<../sentinel-range.md>)

Nidzahar, loosely 'east-land', is one of the five [Dwarven Kingdoms](<./dwarven-kingdoms.md>) of [Labkhan](<../sentinel-range.md>). It is located predominately on the eastern side of the mountains, loosely bordered by [Fahnukan](<./fahnukan.md>) to the north, [Am'khazar](<./am-khazar.md>) to the west, [Zimkova](<../../greater-sembara/zimkova/zimkova.md>) to the east, and [Khatridun](<./khatridun.md>) to the south. Nidzahar is the largest in area of the [Dwarven Kingdoms](<./dwarven-kingdoms.md>), but is primarily settled along its eastern border. 
## History

Although Nidzahar's history, like all the kingdoms of [Labkhan](<../sentinel-range.md>), stretches far back to the very beginnings of time, long before the [Downfall](<../../../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>), for much of its existence it was something of a backwater, a minor kingdom, neither populous or prosperous. Lacking the mineral wealth of [Am'khazar](<./am-khazar.md>) to the southwest, and the trade connections of [Ardith](<./ardith.md>) or [Khatridun](<./khatridun.md>) to the south, Nidzahar was historically known primarily as a place of iconoclasts, thinkers, and artisans.Â 

After the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the center of dwarven wealth and civilization in [Khatridun](<./khatridun.md>) and [Ardith](<./ardith.md>) fell, and Nidzahar attracted most of the trade with [Sembara](<../../greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) that remained, turning the raw mineral wealth of [Am'khazar](<./am-khazar.md>) to the west into armor, weapons, and stranger innovations. Now, Nidzahar is the largest and most technologically advanced of the five kingdoms.

## Culture and Economy

Nidzahar has long been a place that attracted tinkerers, technologists, artificers, and others seeking to push the foundations of dwarven skill and knowledge. Although not a place of fabulous mineral wealth, like [Am'khazar](<./am-khazar.md>), in recent years Nidzahar has become something of the workshop of the [Dwarven Kingdoms](<./dwarven-kingdoms.md>), and has rapidly filled the economic vacuum left by the collapse of [Ardith](<./ardith.md>) and destruction of parts of [Khatridun](<./khatridun.md>) at the end of the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>).

The dwarven kingdom of Ardith, once rich and prosperous and spreading from was overrun in the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>). Most of the [dwarves](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) who survived settled in the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../greater-dunmar/yuvanti-mountains.md>), founding the new kingdom of [Nardith](<../../greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/nardith.md>).

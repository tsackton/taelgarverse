# Khatridun
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [dwarven](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) realm in [Labkhan](<../sentinel-range.md>)  
</div>


The Kingdom of Khatridun was once the greatest, oldest, and most powerful of the five kingdoms. Rumored to be the first place where dwarves settled in the world, none could deny the ancient history of the Kingdom of Khatridun. At their height during the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the Kingdom of Khatridun lost more than any kingdom, excepting the destroyed Kingdom of [Ardith](<./ardith.md>), during that time. The ancient city an capital was destroyed in the destruction that followed the death of Chaâ€™mutte, and many soldiers from Khatridun lost their lives defending dwarves, and humans, and others.  

In the aftermath of the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), Khatridun has turned inward. Much of its former wealth was lost as trade between the east and the west all but ceased, and never blessed with excessive mineral wealth, the people of Khatridun turned inward and to their history, looking for lost knowledge from a prior age to help them rise again.

### Quicksilver Pools

In the kingdom of Khatridun, there can be found shimmering pools of quicksilver. Most, but not all, are deep underground; these pools are carefully tended, as quicksilver can be used in many magical crafts. 

[Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) visited one such pool as a child.

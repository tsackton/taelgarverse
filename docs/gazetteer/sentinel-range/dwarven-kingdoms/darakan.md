# Darakan
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [dwarven](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) city in [Khatridun](<./khatridun.md>), [Labkhan](<../sentinel-range.md>), [Central Highlands Region](<../central-highlands-region.md>)  
</div>


Darakan is set high in the mountains, split between the upper levels on the surface, and the lower levels belowground. It is famous for its fine marbleworks, especially the elaborate stonework marking the gates of the upper city, set high in a cliff face, and reached by a series of marble steps and arches. 

Home to clan Highkeep, including [Seeker](<../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) and [Frankar](<../../../people/dwarves/frankar.md>).

Praznitsky is a mysterious city on the north coast of the [Eastern Green Sea](<../eastern-green-sea/eastern-green-sea.md>), and one of the few ports where foreigners are allowed to trade in the country of [Ursk](<./ursk.md>). 

The city itself is a walled coastal settlement, where foreigners are prohibited. The trading port, with a harbor for foreign ships, is on an island a short distance off the coast, connected to the mainland by a stone bridge, a single span with no obvious supports. The bridge is patrolled by masked wizards. 

The city is known for strange goods from the north, including furs, hide, and monster parts. Most prized of all is dragon hide, which is sold for exorbitant prices to foreign traders.

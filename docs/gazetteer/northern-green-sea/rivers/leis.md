-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river [Ursk](<../ursk/ursk.md>)  
</div>


A swift-flowing river that runs from the mountains near [Vedmakov](<../ursk/vedmakov.md>) until it joins the [Beyil](<./beyil.md>) near the village of [Volya](<../ursk/volya.md>). A road runs parallel to the Leis for much of its length, but the river itself is unnavigable, except when frozen in the depths of winter.

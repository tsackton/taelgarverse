# The Voknaz Manor
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A manor in [Ursk](<./ursk.md>), the Northern Green Sea  
</div>


The Voknaz Manor serves as the headquarters of the [Rodnya Voknaz](<../../groups/urskan-magical-organizations/rodnya-voknaz.md>). Located in western Ursk, the manor is protected by extensive magic. It houses at least one extraplanar portal, to the [Frostfell](<../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/frostfell.md>). 

The inner keep sits on a small artificial lake, surrounded by a permanent wall of fire. The entire complex is surrounded by a wall of stone; a number of support buildings and other structures are located on the shore of the lake, and are used to entertain visitors, among other things.

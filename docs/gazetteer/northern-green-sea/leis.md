# Leis

-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in [Ursk](<./ursk.md>), the Northern Green Sea  
</div>


A swift-flowing river that runs from the mountains near [Vedmakov](<./vedmakov.md>) until it joins the [Beyil](<./beyil.md>) near the village of [Volya](<./volya.md>). A road runs parallel to the Leis for much of its length, but the river itself is unnavigable, except when frozen in the depths of winter.

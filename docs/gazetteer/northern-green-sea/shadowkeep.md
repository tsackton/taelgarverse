Shadowkeep was the base of operations for [Rhodar von Glauer](<../../people/other-nonhumans/rhodar-von-glauer.md>), a vampire lord who ruled a significant area on the north coast of the Green Sea, west of Ursk and east of Skaerhem. 

Constructed with infernal magic on the top of [Drachen Peak](<./drachen-peak.md>), the Shadowkeep served as a place of respite for vampires under the control of Rhodar von Glauer, and the center of his power. 

It was destroyed in DR 1749 upon the permanent death of [Rhodar von Glauer](<../../people/other-nonhumans/rhodar-von-glauer.md>) at the hands of the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), as the infernal magic that sustained the structure of the keep was tied to Rhodar.

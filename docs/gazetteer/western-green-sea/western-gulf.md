# The Western Gulf
>[!info]+ Information

>> 

The Western Gulf is the inland sea at the far western edge of the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) Separated from [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) proper by the narrow [Straits of Cymea](<./straits-of-cymea.md>), the Western Gulf tends to milder weather and easier navigation. 

In the 1700s, the Western Gulf has been controlled largely by the [Tollen](<tollen/tollen.md>) Navy, which extensively patrols and interdicts pirates, keeping shipping lanes safe. 

While most of the Western Gulf is a relatively shallow sea, several deep canyons may hold unusual mysteries in the depths.

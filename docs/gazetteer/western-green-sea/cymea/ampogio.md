-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in [Cymea](<./cymea.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


The longest river in Cymea, flowing from the [~Cymea Border Mountains~](<../cymea-border-mountains.md>), along the western edge of the rocky interior, until it reaches the [Western Green Sea](<../western-green-sea.md>). The upper reaches for the Ampogio are unnavigable, marked by frequent waterfalls as it cascades through the karst landscapes of interior Cymea. Below the confluence with the ~Unnamed East Fork~, the Ampogio slows and widens until it drains into the [Western Green Sea](<../western-green-sea.md>).

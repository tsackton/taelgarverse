Western Cymea is a frontier these days, a place of small strongholds, fortified market towns, and ancient ruins recalling a richer past. This part of the world is a land of rushing, rocky rivers between the Plataca Hills and the Western Gulf, of mild winters and warm summers, of cattle and wine. Historically, it was a place where piracy and banditry thrived, but over the past few generations, a series of campaigns by the powerful Tollender navy stamped out the worst of the piracy. Now, western Cymea is functionally a protectorate of Tollen, sending aimless youth to work the Tollender ships that ply the [Green Sea](<../../green-sea.md>).

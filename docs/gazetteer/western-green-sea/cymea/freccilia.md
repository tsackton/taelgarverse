-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in [Cymea](<../realms/cymea.md>), the [Western Green Sea](<../western-green-sea.md>)  
</div>


A small rushing river in central Cymea, flowing north from the rocky foothills of the ~Cymea Border Mountains~ until it joins the [Ampogio](<./ampogio.md>) south of the [Plataca Hills](<./plataca-hills.md>) and east of the [Latazaro](<../../greater-sembara/latazaro.md>).


The Freccilia is the location of the [Elemental Forge](<./elemental-forge.md>), which is located in a cave complex reached via an underground segment of the river.

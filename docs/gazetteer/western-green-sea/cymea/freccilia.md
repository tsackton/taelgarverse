</div>


A small rushing river in central Cymea, flowing north from the rocky foothills of the [~Cymea Border Mountains~](<../cymea-border-mountains.md>) until it joins the [Ampogio](<./ampogio.md>) south of the [Plataca Hills](<./plataca-hills.md>) and east of the [Latazaro](<./latazaro.md>).


The Freccilia is the location of the [Elemental Forge](<./elemental-forge.md>), which is located in a cave complex reached via an underground segment of the river.

# The Singing Fox
>[!info]+ Information
> 
>> 

A cozy halfling tavern in Fairgate Outer, run by [Chenna Goodbarrel](<../../../people/halflings/chenna-goodbarrel.md>) and her wife [Harriet](<../../../people/halflings/harriet-goodbarrel.md>). Harriet is a decent singer and The Singing Fox gets a decent crowd (mostly locals and passing halflings) when she is performing.

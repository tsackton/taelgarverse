# The Singing Fox
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [halfling](<../../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/halflings/halflings.md>) inn in [Fairgate Outer](<./fairgate-outer.md>), the [Free City of Tollen](<./tollen.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A cozy halfling tavern in [Fairgate Outer](<./fairgate-outer.md>), run by [Chenna Goodbarrel](<../../../people/halflings/chenna-goodbarrel.md>) and her wife [Harriet](<../../../people/halflings/harriet-goodbarrel.md>). Harriet is a good singer and The Singing Fox gets a decent crowd (mostly locals and passing halflings) when she is performing.

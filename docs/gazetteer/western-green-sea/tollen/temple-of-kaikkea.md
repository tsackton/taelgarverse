An ancient building in [Tollen](<./tollen.md>), one of the original structures, once outside the city walls, but later incorporated into the city. Dedicated to the Skaer goddess [Kaikkea](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>), and used by the Skaer, who maintain a presence here. 

Made of white marble, with walls like undulating waves.

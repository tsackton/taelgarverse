Gold Street is one of the 17 wards of [Tollen](<./tollen.md>), located on the north bank of the [Volta](<../../greater-sembara/rivers/volta-watershed/volta.md>) river, west [Bridgeward](<./bridgeward.md>). The now-covered [Fat Brook](<./fat-brook.md>) flows under the ward. The eponymous Gold Street runs east to west parallel to the river, home to merchant estates and banks. The ward is also home to a number of guild palaces, and the Tollen Mint.

Antaka is a small island dominated by a massive volcano. There are four small villages here, which together make a single district of only 6 oskunja. 

Three of the villages are nestled by the ocean near small harbors, and are largely fishing villages. The fourth is associated with the volcanic sacred site.

[Skalme](<../../../people/skaer/skalme.md>) is the priest of the temple to [Kaikkea](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>) at the volcanic site.

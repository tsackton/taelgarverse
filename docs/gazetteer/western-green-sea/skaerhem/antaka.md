-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } An island in [Skaerhem](<./skaerhem.md>), the [Western Green Sea](<../western-green-sea.md>)  
</div>


Antaka is a small island dominated by a massive volcano. There are four small villages here, which together make a single district of only 6 oskunja. 

Three of the villages are nestled by the ocean near small harbors, and are largely fishing villages. The fourth village, the largest, sits below the caldera of the crater, a few hours walk from a holy site and temple to [Kaikkea](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>) associated with the volcano. [Skalme](<../../../people/skaer/skalme.md>) is the priest here.

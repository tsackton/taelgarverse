> A town in [Skaerhem](<./skaerhem.md>)

Pyhlla a port town, on a volcanic rocky island, less than a day's sail from [Vetta](<./vetta.md>), the island of the sacred waters. 

The town has a population of maybe 800 people: enough to feel substantial, but not a major city by any means. It sits on a deep, sheltered harbor in a rocky fjord, where a pair of wooden quays jut into the water, and several high-sided longboats rest at anchor. 

In the winter, with little daylight, the town is lit by firelight for a good part of the evening. Plenty of light, but it is mostly "Continual Flame," so while the town is bright, it feels cold -- everyone goes around dressed in many layers of fur. There is often snow on the ground, and the rivers freeze regularly. 

There are no inns here, and no real infrastructure for travelers. Strangers are not widely welcome in Skaer ports, and foreign merchants typically sleep on their ship.

The main communal gathering places is the church of [Kaikkea](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>), which has an attached covered bar and a large fire circle. There is room in the church for visitors to sleep, at need, but it is not very comfortable and not well heated. 

Most people live in turf houses, with grass roofs, with a significant cluster of houses around the docks and churchyard.

Pyhlla is a particularly large district, with 11 oskunja, and two priests in addition to the hakeasa.

# Blessing of [Kaikkea](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>)

All pilgrims to [Vetta](<./vetta.md>) must accept the blessing of [Kaikkea](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>). This involves being submerged in a deep quarry cut out of the stone, and prayed over.

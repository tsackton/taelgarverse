Skaerhem, called Skaegenland by the Sembarans, is a collection of islands (the Skaer Islands), many volcanic, and the nearby coastline in the northwestern corner of the [Green Sea](<../../green-sea.md>). This is a land of frequent storms, rocky land, and difficult seas, but also a region teaming with marine bounty, and rich in rare volcanic metals and precious stones. 
## Geography

## Major Historical Eras
_See more: {links}_

This area saw much disruption and loss of life in the [Blood Years](<../../events/1500s/blood-years.md>) and many details of the early history of the region are lost. The scholars of Chardon have preserved better records of the Drankorian Era, and a rough history can be reconstructed. 
#### Before Drankor
_Before DR 597_
Little is known of the history of this region before the the coming of Drankor.  It is widely believed that early migrants from [Hkar](<../../history/pre-downfall/hkar.md>) lived along the [~North Chardon Coast~](<chardonian-empire/north-chardon-coast.md>) in the shadow of [AlcarinquÃ«](<../../history/pre-downfall/alcarinque.md>) before the [Downfall](<../../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>) but the cultures and civilizations these migrants formed during and after the Downfall is not recorded. 
#### Western Wars
_DR 597 - DR 634_
Between DR 597 and DR 634, Drankor fought a series of series of wars to force the people of the [Yeraad Watershed](<../major-rivers/yeraad-watershed/yeraad-watershed.md>) and [~North Chardon Coast~](<chardonian-empire/north-chardon-coast.md>) into the growing Drankorian Empire.  In the telling of the Faculty of History at the [University of Chardon](<chardonian-empire/chardon/university-of-chardon.md>), the  wars brought civilization and safety to a land full of dangers. The Society of Ocean Watchers in [Hamri](<../northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/hamri.md>) would tell a different tale, of Drankorian conquest seeking treasure and plunder, and agricultural land for their expanding empire, with no concerns for the inhabitants of the land.
#### Drankorian Era
_DR 634 - DR 1059_
For the next five hundred years, Drankor ruled in peace and prosperity. The city of [Chardon](<chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) was founded, and grew and prospered. Few records are well attested of this time, although surely the Faculty of History has lost scrolls or hidden records that tell of the growth of the city of Chardon, at least.
#### Fall of Drankor and Post-Imperial Era
_DR 1059 - DR 1540_
When Drankor fell to [plague](<../../events/1000s/1059/first-plague.md>) and the empire shattered, the imperial provinces were left to fend for themselves. In the chaos, [Chardon](<chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) emerged as a leading light, first amongst equals in the post-Drankorian landscape, growing rich on the wisdom and fame of its [university](<chardonian-empire/chardon/university-of-chardon.md>) and [library](<chardonian-empire/chardon/great-library.md>), as well as trade with Dunmar through the [Myraeni Gap](<../greater-dunmar/myraeni-gap.md>) and [Sembara](<../greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) along the [Yeraad](<./yeraad.md>) river and over the [Sentinels](<../sentinel-range.md>) at [Urlich Pass](<../central-highlands/urlich-pass.md>).  Although tales of the small kingdoms that grew from the imperial provinces along the [~North Chardon Coast~](<chardonian-empire/north-chardon-coast.md>) must exist, they are not widely known, and this period is largely a blank in the popular imagination.

#### The Blood Years
_DR 1545 - DR 1597_
Although the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) ended in DR 1545, the vast army of hobgoblins and other terrors that [Cha'mutte](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) had amassed did not simply disappear. Over the next 30 years, two major wars were fought across the lands north of Chardon: the Conclave War and the to be named war against the hobgoblins. 

basic idea: conclave war then in the 1560s a series of expansion of hobgoblins, stopped in 1561 or 1562, but not really peaceful - next 10 years are back and forth along the north chardon coast; but in 1574 some type of armistace line is drawn, splitting (or even leaving the hobgoblins with most of the coast). Perhaps there is another human kingdom involved here (the "yellow 5 kingdom from other maps"?) in the north, pincering the hobgoblins a bit.

#### Early Imperial Era
_DR 1597 - DR _
During mawar renai; hobgoblins are stilla round the malakel entrance, but somewhat hemmed in by something in the north so don't really have a good expansion plan; perhaps even being somewhat decent rulers in a way; chardon growing in the chasa valley but not really an empire just yet

 DR 1597, when the Umbral Covenant launches the Shadow Armada to conquer Chardon, and loses badly - awakening moment - empire is working this is not like the conclave war at all leads to first serious wave of expansion
#### Imperial Expansion
_DR 1597 - present_
three phases: 
* apporia - 1597 - 1610 
* 1650 - 1675 - conquest of hobgoblins; (mindknife war just after this)
* 1690 - 1710 - chaylte


Whatever the truth, in the first few decades of the 600th year since the founding of Drankor, the legions of empire swept through the region, and established suzerainty over all the land between the [Tawir Forest](<../northwest-coast/tawir-forest.md>) in the north and [Ainumarya](<../central-highlands/ainumarya.md>) in the east. Whatever the origins of this conquest, for almost 500 years the land prospered, and the city of [Chardon](<chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) was founded and grew. 

When the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) came, the lands north of [Chardon](<chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) bore the brunt of the attacks from [Cha'mutte's](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>) armies, and even after his defeat, the hobgoblins did not vanish. The [Blood Years](<../../events/1500s/blood-years.md>) saw the destruction of many of the small realms to the north, and during the Conclave War threatened [Chardon](<chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) itself. In the aftermath of these wars, the [Chardonian Empire](<chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>) was born.








## Overview

## Boundaries

The West Coast Region includes the entirety of the [Chardonian Empire](<chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>), as well as the [Nevos Sea](<../nevos-and-apporia/nevos-sea.md>) area, the [Mawakel Peninsula](<../northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>), and the [Erbalta Plains](<../northwest-coast/erbalta-plains/erbalta-plains.md>), plus the coastal regions west and north of the [Erbalta Plains](<../northwest-coast/erbalta-plains/erbalta-plains.md>). It also includes the islands in the [Endless Ocean](<../endless-ocean.md>). 

- To the north, this region is bordered by the mysterious cold of the [Far North](<../faraway-places/far-north.md>). 
- To the east, this region is bordered by the ~North Nahadi River~, [Ainumarya](<../central-highlands/ainumarya.md>), and the [Myraeni Gap](<../greater-dunmar/myraeni-gap.md>).
- To the south, this region is bordered by the [Sea of Storms](<../drankorian-hinterland/sea-of-storms.md>) and the ocean beyond the [Nevos Sea](<../nevos-and-apporia/nevos-sea.md>)
- To the west, this region is bordered by the [Endless Ocean](<../endless-ocean.md>)

## Major Features



- [~North Chardon Coast~](<chardonian-empire/north-chardon-coast.md>): *The wide coastland north of Chardon. Canonically all that is developed about this area is that it is fertile agricultural land. This is approx. 38 N to 45 N latitudes. Probably the southern part is more strictly Mediterranean, with extensive cotton, olive, and wine production (Metium is a major wine-producer), while the northern part is highly productive for grains. Basic geographic/climatic outline is Mediterranean in the south transitioning to a more oceanic influence in the north, with grain cultivation in river valleys and hot-summer crops like olives in the hills. Probably should extend the oceanic climate of Mawar into the northern stretches of this area, around 45 N. Real world influences would include parts of Italy, southern France, and other Med agricultural areas, and California Central Valley.*
- [Lake Valandros](<./lake-valandros.md>): *Huge lake, with no canonical details. Likely somewhat dry on the west side and humid and rainy on the east side, just from mountain influence. Probably also agricultural - rice production for example might be common.*
- [Mawakel Peninsula](<../northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>): *See Mawar notes. Currently unresolved is if this is more of a Cool Maritime Climate (Cfb) with limited winter snow, as currently marked (analogy: coastal Ireland, Pacific NW), or if this is more of a Subpolar Oceanic Climate (Cfc) with heavy winter snowfall and limited agriculture (analogy: Iceland or Norwegian coasts). I guess I have leaned towards the former, with the further north coast beyond Mawar more of the Norway analog.*
- ~North Bay~: *Lots of land northeast of Mawar. The east coast, near Voltara, has a bit of detail from Great Library campaign, but otherwise this is totally open and undeveloped.*
- [Snake River](<../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/snake-river.md>): *Canon: center for chalyte mining - mountainous and arid with extensive plains.*
- [Tawir Forest](<../northwest-coast/tawir-forest.md>): *So far just a name.*
- [Chasa River Valley](<chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/chasa-river-valley.md>): *agricultural mixed with forests, major population center*
- [Yeraad Watershed](<../major-rivers/yeraad-watershed/yeraad-watershed.md>): *southeast of Chardon, south of Chasa/Elderwood. Major lizardfolk area, mining in the hills that separate it from Chasa, and in the "Darba Mountains". Very little detail otherwise - probably fairly flat, hot in the summer. This is basically med transitioning to semi-arid in the east and south, likely supporting fruit trees near the coast, and extensive livestock, probably the center of the Chardon cattle industry.*
- [Apporia](<chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>): *Undeveloped until the kelp forest adventure off the coast.* 
- [Nevos Sea](<../nevos-and-apporia/nevos-sea.md>) and Emerald Bay: *trending into subtropics here*




## Climate

Most of the extensive coastline of the Chardonian empire, stretching from the mouth of the [Yeraad](<./yeraad.md>) river to the southern fringes of the [Mawakel Peninsula](<../northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>), is a temperate region with [warm or hot summers and wet, cool winters](https://geodiode.com/climate/mediterranean). The [Mawakel Peninsula](<../northwest-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>) itself ...

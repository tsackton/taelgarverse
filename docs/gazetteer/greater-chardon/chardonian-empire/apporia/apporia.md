Apporia, or the Apporian Peninsula, is a very large peninsula that stretches west from the area between the [Yeraad Watershed](<../../../major-rivers/yeraad-watershed/yeraad-watershed.md>) and the [Chasa River Valley](<../chasa-river-valley/chasa-river-valley.md>), and surrounded by the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>) to the northeast, the Emerald Bay and the [Nevos Sea](<../../../nevos-and-apporia/nevos-sea.md>) to the southeast, and the [Endless Ocean](<../../../endless-ocean.md>) to the west. The [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>) runs through the base of the peninsula, providing a shipping route between the [Nevos Sea](<../../../nevos-and-apporia/nevos-sea.md>) and the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>). The northern interior of the peninsula is dominated by wild lands of rough mountains, with deep valleys dotted with forests, where few people live. The Gulf of Chardon coast, stretching about 540 miles from the salt marshes around the canal mouth to the northern tip of the peninsula, is rich in trade and agriculture. 
## Settlement

The northwestern coast, along the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>), is part of the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>), and is made up of three provinces: [Portalia](<./portalia.md>), [Cedrano](<./cedrano.md>), and Raziolo. While the Chardonian legions have a strong presence in Portalia, and the governor of Portalia is typically hand-picked by the Magistros, the further provinces (Cedrano and especially Raziolo) are substantially autonomous. 

Beyond humans, the northwestern coast of Apporia has significant halfling communities, and a number of small lizardfolk villages, especially west of the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>), on the swampy borders between [Portalia](<./portalia.md>) and [Cedrano](<./cedrano.md>). Few dwarves and stoneborn remain on Apporia since the War of the Dark Rift, and unlike most places in Taelgar, there are more stoneborn than dwarves. Those of these species who do remain often live among humans. 



Who else might live in the wild interiors of Apporia, is not known. 
## History 




According to the records of the Chardonian Empire, the Apporian Peninsula was originally settled by the Drankorians, who originally constructed the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>) and established a series of maritime bases on the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>) and the [Nevos Sea](<../../../nevos-and-apporia/nevos-sea.md>), although never reached the western coast or the interior. These records do not speak to whether any peoples lived on the coasts prior to Drankorian settlement, or who might have lived -- or still live -- in the interior. 

After the fall of Drankor, [Castrella](<./castrella.md>), in the current day province of [Cedrano](<./cedrano.md>) became a significant maritime power, exerting control over the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>), the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>), and the rich agricultural territory on the coastal plains of Raziolo. By the time of the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the canal was jointly managed by a confederation of Chardonian and Castrellan traders, as Chardon grew in influence. 

In the chaos after the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), [Illorian](<../../../nevos-and-apporia/illoria.md>) pirates under the command of [Chirce](<../../../../people/historical-figures/chirce.md>) established control over much of the current day territory of [Portalia](<./portalia.md>), including the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>), and parts of current day [Cedrano](<./cedrano.md>), although not the capital [Castrella](<./castrella.md>), or the current day province of Raziolo. After [Chirce](<../../../../people/historical-figures/chirce.md>) was driven out of [Darba](<../../../greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>) in DR 1559, he made Pergia, the city at the Emerald Bay entrance to the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>), his capital, and lived off the profits of the canal trade. During the next 10 years, [Castrella](<./castrella.md>) reconquered much of what is now [Cedrano](<./cedrano.md>), and reestablished a significant maritime presence in the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>). 

In DR 1584, the War of the Dark Rift erupted in the interior mountains of [Apporia](<./apporia.md>), in the dwarven and stoneborn kingdom of Enderra. Over the next few years, the Umbral Covenant conquered much of the coastline, completely destroying [Nevium](<./nevium.md>), disrupting trade on the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>), and besieging [Castrella](<./castrella.md>). This is the definitive end of the Illorian pirate kingdoms, and leads to much destruction in [Portalia](<./portalia.md>), in particular. The war continues until DR 1597, when the Umbral Covenant launches the Shadow Armada to conquer Chardon, and loses badly. Over the next few years, a series of interior campaigns destroys the Umbral Covenant and establishes Chardonian control over [Portalia](<./portalia.md>). Soon after, [Cedrano](<./cedrano.md>), weak and dependent on Chardonian legions for survival, formally joins the growing [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>). 



Over the next two generations, Chardonian influence grows on the peninsula, eventually leading to economic pressure for Raziolo to formally join the Empire.



By the DR 1700s, the War of the Dark Rift is largely forgotten, the interior forts are largely abandoned, and the mountains of the interior turn wild.

title: Politics of Chalyte (Chardonian Empire)
---

Chalyte is the source of much of the magical might of Chardon, the engine behind its powerful navy, and the source of much of its wealth. Since the discovery of chalyte in the area around Voltara, control of the chalyte trade has been a contentious political issue.

Formally, chalyte is a charter monopoly in the Chardonian Empire. Refined chalyte can only be produced by license holders, although once stamped and approved the processed chalyte can be resold freely. Four powerful families, often referred to as the [Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon](<../../../groups/chardonian-organizations/chalyte-oligarchs-of-chardon.md>), have been granted this charter monopoly for many years. It is often suspected, although never proven, that corrupt dealings between the four families and the [Curia of 42](<../../../groups/chardonian-organizations/curia-of-42.md>) maintains the status quo.

In recent years, the Hetaeri Magica has become almost the sole purchaser of refined chalyte, which it then resells to artisans and others around the city. The primary exception is the Windcallers, who are guaranteed by the terms of the monopoly to purchase a fraction of the refined production of any licensed operator. 

Despite the potential for corruption and the dangers of the refineries, few in Chardon would willingly return to the pre-chalyte era. It is chalyte that powers the magic fountains in every square, ensuring clean and pure drinking water for the citizens of the city, and the lights that keep the streets safe at night, among other marvels.

# Arendum
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A city in the [Chasa River Valley](<./chasa-river-valley.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>), [Greater Chardon](<../../greater-chardon.md>)  
</div>




Arendum is a substantial provincial town, with a frontier vibe. Built on the ruins of a former city-state, [Kin-Aska](<./kin-aska.md>), which was a Chardonian satellite, a mixed Northlander/Drankorian culture with good relations with the nearby Deno'qai tribes in the forests, as well as the elves.

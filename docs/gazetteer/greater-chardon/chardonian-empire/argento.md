-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A city in [Alta Tonaro](<./alta-tonaro.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<./chardonian-empire.md>), [Greater Chardon](<../greater-chardon.md>)

Argento is the largest city, and provincial capital, of [Alta Tonaro](<./alta-tonaro.md>). Founded during the boom years of chalyte mining in the northern [Chataan Mountains](<../chataan-mountains.md>), its fortunes have declined significantly over the past two generations. Now, its economy depends largely on a few productive silver mines.

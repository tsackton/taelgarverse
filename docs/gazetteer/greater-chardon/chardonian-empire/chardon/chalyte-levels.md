# The Chalyte Levels
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A neighborhood in the [North Bank](<./north-bank.md>), [Chardon](<./chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>)  
</div>


The Chalyte Levels is the low-lying riverbank area, nestled between the western part of the [North Wall](<./north-wall-chardon.md>) and the banks of the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>). This area is largely slums, with many decrepit dwellings converted from old barracks build during the [Blood Years](<../../../../events/1500s/blood-years.md>). 

Precinct XVIII is entirely congruent with the traditional boundries of the Chalyte Levels.

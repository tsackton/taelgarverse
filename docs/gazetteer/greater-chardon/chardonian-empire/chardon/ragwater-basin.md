# Ragwater Basin
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A neighborhood in the [North Bank](<./north-bank.md>), [Chardon](<./chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>)  
</div>


Ragwater Basin, usually just called the Basin, is a neighborhood downriver from the [North Wall](<./north-wall-chardon.md>). Historically, this was the center of the Chardonian paper-making industry, but in the past 80 years the old paper mills have been converted to chalyte refineries, and the [Mill Channel](<./mill-channel.md>) repurposed to carry ore barges from the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>). 

This is a dirty, stinking area, and only the poorest of the poor actually live here. The nearby [Riverside Quarter](<./riverside-quarter.md>), huddled against the banks of the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>), is only marginally more pleasant. 

Together, the Basin and Riverside make up Precinct XVII.

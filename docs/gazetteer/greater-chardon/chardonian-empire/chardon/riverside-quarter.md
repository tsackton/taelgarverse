# The Riverside Quarter
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A neigborhood in the [North Bank](<./north-bank.md>), [Chardon](<./chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>)  
</div>


The Riverside Quarter, often just called Riverside, is a neighborhood nestled outside the walls, against the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>), south of the [Basin](<./ragwater-basin.md>), and west of the walled part of the [North Bank](<./north-bank.md>). This area is poor, smelly, and often floods during the highest tides, and only the most desperate live here. 

Riverside together with the [Basin](<./ragwater-basin.md>) makes up Precinct XVII.

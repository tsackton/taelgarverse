# The Mill Channel
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A canal in the [North Bank](<./north-bank.md>), [Chardon](<./chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>), [Greater Chardon](<../../greater-chardon.md>)  
</div>


The Mill Channel is the largest of the canals and waterworks that connects the refineries of the [Ragwater Basin](<./ragwater-basin.md>) to the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>). It cuts through the [Bastion Quarter](<./bastion-quarter.md>), passing under the trade road, and then exits the walls via the [River Gate](<./river-gate-north-chardon.md>). From their, it loops west before veering south to reconnect with the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>) downstream of the main port and the naval arsenal.

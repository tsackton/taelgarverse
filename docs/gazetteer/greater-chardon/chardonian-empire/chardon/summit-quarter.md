# The Summit Quarter
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A neighborhood in the [North Bank](<./north-bank.md>), [Chardon](<./chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>)  
</div>


The Summit Quarter rises to the east (upriver) from the [Bastion](<./bastion-quarter.md>), on the slopes of the spur of [Mount Nera](<./mount-nera.md>) that stretches towards the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>). This is an area of terraced streets, artisans' workshops and houses, and the occasional small manor of the wealthy overseers of the chalyte refineries on the flats below. The Summit Quarter is bordered on the west by the line of the [North Wall](<./north-wall-chardon.md>) that runs along the height of land of the spur and separates the bulk of the [North Bank](<./north-bank.md>) from the rich manors and enclaves of the [Nera Domains](<./nera-domains.md>). 

The Bastion Quarter and the [Summit Quarter](<./summit-quarter.md>) together make up Precinct XIX.

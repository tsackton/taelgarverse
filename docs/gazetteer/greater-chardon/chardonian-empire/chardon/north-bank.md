# The North Bank
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } An urban area in [Chardon](<./chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>), [Greater Chardon](<../../greater-chardon.md>)  
</div>


The North Bank refers to the neighborhoods of [Chardon](<./chardon.md>) on the north side of the [Chasa River](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>)
.

The dominant geographic feature on the North Bank is [Mount Nera](<./mount-nera.md>), a long extinct volcano, with a conic summit peak of basalt and obsidian, rumored to be deeply magical. While the bulk of the mountain itself rises some distance from the river, a sharp spur runs north-south between the summit and the river, dividing the North Bank.

To the west (downriver) of the spur, the land slopes steeply down to a flat lowlands along the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>). Historically much of this area was dominated by paper mills, with several mill streams and canals cut to redirect water from the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>). In the present day, this industrial infrastructure has largely been repurposed for chalyte refining, though the area is still known as [Ragwater Basin](<./ragwater-basin.md>), though this is often shortened to just the Basin. The largest canal, the [Mill Channel](<./mill-channel.md>), now carries riverboats of raw chalyte ore from [Voltara](<../../../northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>) directly to the refineries for processing.  

During the [Great War](<../../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and the [Blood Years](<../../../../events/1500s/blood-years.md>), the [North Wall (Chardon)](<./north-wall-chardon.md>) was built, running along the height of the [Mount Nera](<./mount-nera.md>) spur, then cutting in two broad switchbacks west and turning in a broad sweep to encompass most of the lowlands, excluding the industrial [Ragwater Basin](<./ragwater-basin.md>). The [Mill Channel](<./mill-channel.md>) runs through the middle of the walled area, exiting the walls to the west via a [river gate](<./river-gate-north-chardon.md>). 

Originally this area was devoted largely to military use. In the current day, the westernmost section of the walled area, near the river gate and towards the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>), is referred to as the [Chalyte Levels](<./chalyte-levels.md>) and is a notable slum, with old barracks repurposed as low-quality housing for workers in the refineries. The slums that spill out of the walls, merging with the dirtiest parts of the [Basin](<./ragwater-basin.md>), are called the [Riverside Quarter](<./riverside-quarter.md>) or just Riverside. 

The central part of the walled area, known as the [Bastion Quarter](<./bastion-quarter.md>), and centered around the [Merchant's Gate](<./trade-gate-chardon.md>), is richer, dotted with inns and taverns catering to the trade that enters the city from north road. Here the land begins to slope upwards along the spur of [Mount Nera](<./mount-nera.md>). As the land slopes upward, the [Bastion Quarter](<./bastion-quarter.md>) transitions to the area known as the [Summit Quarter](<./summit-quarter.md>), where respectable houses dot the streets and artisans make a living above the stink of the lowlands along the riverbank. 

East (upriver) of the fortifications along the height of land of the [Mount Nera](<./mount-nera.md>) spur, the land is hillier and dryer, and this region, known as the [Nera Domains](<./nera-domains.md>), is dotted with elaborate manors of the rich and prosperous. 

Two major bridges cross the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>), connecting the North Bank to the bulk of the city to the south. 
- The farthest downriver, connecting the [Bastion Quarter](<./bastion-quarter.md>) to the [Precinct VII](<./precinct-vii.md>), is the [River Bridge](<./river-bridge-chardon.md>), a massive arching bridge, with an enchanted mechanism allowing the middle section to be be raised for tall-masted ships to pass under, and wide enough for four wagons to cross abreast. 
- Upriver from the [River Bridge](<./river-bridge-chardon.md>) is the [Chardon Bridge](<./chardon-bridge.md>), marking the height of navigation on the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>), and connecting the [Summit Quarter](<./summit-quarter.md>) to  [Precinct VI](<./precinct-vi.md>). 

These bridge crossings are supplemented by numerous ferries that dot the shores of the [Chasa](<../../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>).

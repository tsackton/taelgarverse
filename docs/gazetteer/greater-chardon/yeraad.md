# Yeraad
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the [Chardonian Empire](<chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>), [Greater Chardon](<./greater-chardon.md>)  
</div>


The Yeraad is a wide, winding river that flows from its source in the [Sentinels](<../sentinel-range.md>), through the southern parts of the [Elderwood](<../central-highlands/elderwood.md>), and across the lowlands to the Emerald Bay. Its name derives from the old Northos name, meaning Green River.

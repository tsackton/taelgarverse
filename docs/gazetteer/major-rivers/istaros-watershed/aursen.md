# Aursen
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the [Istaros Watershed](<./istaros-watershed.md>)  
</div>


The Aursen starts in the foothills of the [Sentinel Range](<../../sentinel-range.md>), fed by snowmelt as it rushes to the flat highland basin on the [Aurbez Plateau](<../../upper-istaros/aurbez-plateau.md>), where it slows and meanders for 20 miles across marshy terrain before dropping in a series of large waterfalls off the plateau, to lower ground. This land around the upper Aursen is marshy and productive, although hard to farm. A small lizardfolk community has lived here since time immemorial, and they are much honored for the welcome and shelter they gave to the first refugees.

title: Chasa Nahadi Watershed
---

The Chasa-Nahadi watershed is a vast river system that drains the interior basin of the western [Sentinels](<../../sentinel-range.md>). Geographically, this watershed is composed of three distinct areas:

- The [Chasa River Valley](<../../greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/chasa-river-valley.md>), consisting of the [Chasa](<./chasa.md>) and its tributaries. The [Chasa](<./chasa.md>) flows west from the southern reaches of the [Central Highlands](<../../central-highlands/central-highlands.md>), passing through vast forests before it is joined by the [Nahadi](<./nahadi.md>) just east of [Chardon](<../../greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>). Numerous tributaries join the [Chasa](<./chasa.md>), largely small forest rivers (exemplified by the [Kayan](<./kayan.md>)). 

- The [Nahadi](<./nahadi.md>) and [Lake Valandros](<../../greater-chardon/lake-valandros.md>) form a distinct region of the watershed, dominated by the vast size of [Lake Valandros](<../../greater-chardon/lake-valandros.md>). The [Nahadi](<./nahadi.md>) is the only outflow from [Lake Valandros](<../../greater-chardon/lake-valandros.md>), and is a wide, broad river for its entire length. Numerous smaller tributaries flow into [Lake Valandros](<../../greater-chardon/lake-valandros.md>). 

- The [Zarnato](<./zarnato.md>) watershed, north of [Lake Valandros](<../../greater-chardon/lake-valandros.md>), drains the interior of the [Northern Provinces](<../../northwest-coast/northern-provinces/northern-provinces.md>) and the western [Sentinels](<../../sentinel-range.md>). The [Zarnato](<./zarnato.md>) is the largest river in this system; just north of [Lake Valandros](<../../greater-chardon/lake-valandros.md>), it is joined by the meandering [Snake River](<./snake-river.md>), which flows east of [Voltara](<../../northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>) and forms the second of the two major parts of the watershed. The major tributaries of the [Zarnato](<./zarnato.md>) include the [Barzhen](<./barzhen.md>), draining [Blackwater Fens](<../../northern-sentinels/blackwater-fens.md>), and the [Arqa](<./arqa.md>), from the [Sentinels](<../../sentinel-range.md>); the major tributaries of the [Snake River](<./snake-river.md>) include the [Wild River](<./wild-river.md>), which cuts across the plains northeast of [Voltara](<../../northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>), and [Kelvaros](<./kelvaros.md>), which joins the [Snake River](<./snake-river.md>) close to its confluence with the [Zarnato](<./zarnato.md>).

-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in [Greater Chardon](<../../greater-chardon/greater-chardon.md>)  
    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Located in the [Chasa-Nahadi Watershed](<./chasa-nahadi-watershed.md>)

The Nahadi is a wide, slow moving river, meandering through a broad alluvial plain, that drains [Lake Valandros](<../../greater-chardon/lake-valandros.md>), and joins the [Chasa](<./chasa.md>) near Chardon. Natural levees fringe the deep main channel, beyond which lie orderly patchworks of irrigated fields to the west and a rising mosaic of oak-pine foothills to the east.

The Nahadi is easily navigable along its entire length, and is a major trade connection and riverboat route in the [Chardonian Empire](<../../greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>). 

The name Nahadi derives from the old Northros word for "mighty river".

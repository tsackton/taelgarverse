# Arqa

<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the [Central Highlands](<../../central-highlands/central-highlands.md>)  
    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Located in the [Chasa-Nahadi Watershed](<./chasa-nahadi-watershed.md>)

The Arqa is a swift-flowing, unnavigable river that cascades down from the [Sentinels](<../../sentinel-range.md>) to join the [Zarnato](<./zarnato.md>), passing through forests and many ravines over its course.

The name derives from the old Northros word for "hidden".

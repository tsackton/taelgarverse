-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A lake in the [Erbalta Plains](<../../northwest-coast/erbalta-plains/erbalta-plains.md>), the [Northwest Coast](<../../northwest-coast/northwest-coast.md>)  
    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Located in the [Chasa-Nahadi Watershed](<./chasa-nahadi-watershed.md>)  
</div>


A small lake nestling in a hilly region on the western edge of the [Erbalta Plains](<../../northwest-coast/erbalta-plains/erbalta-plains.md>); the source of the [Kelvaros](<./kelvaros.md>) and a frequent stop-over place for migrating [centaurs](<../../../species/unusual-species/centaurs.md>). 

The name derives from the Drankorian for "spring-hill", and is sometimes referred to as Lake Pegokolonos in historical works. 

The tomb of Xameia the Forsworn is located on this lake, and it is a place with some historical significance to the Order of Twilight.

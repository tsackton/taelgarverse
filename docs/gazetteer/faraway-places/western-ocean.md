## Map
## Topography and Major Features
The [Endless Ocean](<../endless-ocean.md>) continues for uncounted and untracked miles, and no other features are known in this region, although some suspect the sunken remains of [Hkar](<../../history/pre-downfall/hkar.md>) may lie somewhere out in the deeps.
## Civilizations and Cultures
It is commonly believed that [merfolk](<../../species/unusual-species/merfolk.md>) live in the oceans here, but few have actually visited any of their cities or underwater realms. Travelers sometimes report strange islands after being lost in a storm, but no one has mapped these far reaches, and many believe the [Endless Ocean](<../endless-ocean.md>) is empty of all land.
## Climate
This region is entirely ocean, mostly temperate. The near shores are relatively navigable, but the farther reaches of the ocean are dangerous. Storms and currents are unpredictable, and few have returned from voyages west. 


## Major Historical Eras
Little is known of the history of the oceans, although legend says that the ancient ~Mariners~ left Hkar and crossed the [Endless Ocean](<../endless-ocean.md>) to reach the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>). Many speak of the lost birthplace of humanity, the now sunken island of [Hkar](<../../history/pre-downfall/hkar.md>), but where it lies is not known.

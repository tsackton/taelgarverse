</div>


In the markets of [Tollen](<../greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) or [Chardon](<../greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), rumors are occasionally heard of great lands faraway to the south and east, where creatures as tall as castles roam and the air is sticky and wet. Others tell of an endless desert, where oases bloom with flowers the size of trees, but death awaits those who lose their way in the endless heat and sand. What truth there are to these rumors is not known.
## Map

{link to leaflet map of region}
## Topography and Major Features
This region is shrouded in mystery, and only a few features are rumored. Many reports of a endless desert stretching for thousands of miles have come west, but beyond that, few know what mysteries this region holds.


[Kenzo](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) brought stories of a tropical jungle called [Orekatu](<./orekatu.md>) by the [lizardfolk](<../../species/lizardfolk.md>) who dwell there.

## Civilizations and Cultures
What civilizations live in this region, beyond -- or within -- the desert is not known.
## Climate
The climate of this region is varied, and not well known - but all the stories tell of hot and humid, or hot and dry places. 



## Major Historical Eras
_See more: the [Founding of Dunmar](<../../primary-sources/founding-of-dunmar.md>)_

Nothing is known of the history of this region. Any people who live here are likely strange and foreign compared to the descendants of [Drankor](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankor.md>). The [Dunmari](<../greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) claim to have come east from somewhere in this region soon after the fall of Drankor, but the exact location of the ancient Dunmari homeland has been lost.

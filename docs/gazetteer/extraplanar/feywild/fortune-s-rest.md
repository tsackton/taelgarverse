# Fortune's Rest
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A realm in the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/feywild.md>), [Multiverse](<../../../cosmology/multiverse.md>)  
</div>


The fey domain of Fortune’s Rest is a sparsely inhabited land of pleasant forests and peaceful meadows, seemingly quiet and still, until one finds or is drawn to the Court of the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/prince-of-luck.md>), the [Prince of Luck](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/prince-of-luck.md>). 

The court set on a vast estate of rolling hills, meadows and gardens, all filled to the brim with a riot of games and dazzling color. Dice games of all kinds, card games, even lizard races, anything one can gamble on can be found among the attractions of the [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/prince-of-luck.md>)’s Court. Food and music flows freely, and the happy veneer of the elegant fey keeps visitors from seeing the people lurking in the shadows, who have gambled away their names, identities, memories, and even luck itself. 

The [Chanceweaver](<../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/prince-of-luck.md>)’s court is difficult to leave, for each way you turn a new attraction tempts you to return. Those who partake in the food and drink often find they have spent days or weeks in a daze, though the natives of the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/feywild.md>) are largely resistant to this effect.

# Redsun Watch
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Fey](<../../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) keep in [Amberglow](<./amberglow.md>), the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/feywild.md>), [Multiverse](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse.md>)  
</div>


Redsun Watch is one of several outposts established by the [Cloudspinner](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) on the eastern edge of [Amberglow](<./amberglow.md>), near the Sunset Gate. Since her disappearance, the fate of Redsun Watch and other border outposts is unknown.


According to [Lirien](<../../../../people/fey/lirien.md>), who was the Lanternkeeper of Redsun Watch, some time after the [Cloudspinner](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>)'s disappearance "rivers of shadow" invaded across the Sunset Gate, from [Hollowdark](<../hollowdark.md>) and [Darkfall](<../darkfall.md>), and Redsun Keep was destroyed.

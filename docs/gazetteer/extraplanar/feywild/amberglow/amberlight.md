# Amberlight
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Fey](<../../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) Glowing Crystal**  

Amberlights are intricate crystal lanterns infused with the light of the sunset of [Amberglow](<./amberglow.md>), created by the [Cloudspinner](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) to gift some of her power to her closest allies. 


[Lirien](<../../../../people/fey/lirien.md>) possessed an Amberlight, which she rescued from the fall of [Redsun Watch](<./redsun-watch.md>). It ceased to cast light not long after she fled [Redsun Watch](<./redsun-watch.md>), and only started to flicker back to light again after the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) rescued [Cloudspinner](<../../../../people/extraplanar-powers/archfey/cloudspinner.md>) from the ~Circular Island~.

# Emberwine
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Fey](<../../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) realm in the [Feywild](<../../../../cosmology/feywild.md>), [Multiverse](<../../../../cosmology/multiverse.md>)  
</div>


Emberwine is a fey realm, south of [Amberglow](<../amberglow/amberglow.md>), west of the Sunset Gate, and east of [Everlight's Bloom](<../everlight-s-bloom.md>). It is a realm of revelry and dance, a place where music and wine flow freely. It is a land of rolling vineyards and gentle hills, bathed in the constant golden light of the late afternoon sun.

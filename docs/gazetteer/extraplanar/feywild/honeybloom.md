# Honeybloom
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Fey](<../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) realm in the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/feywild.md>), [Multiverse](<../../../cosmology/multiverse.md>)  
</div>


A fey realm, described in [The Lore of the Feywild](<../../../things/books/the-lore-of-the-feywild.md>) as a realm of rolling orchards, golden meadows, and drowsy glades, where the scent of ripe fruit lingers in the air, lulling visitors into languid contentmentâ€”but those who linger too long often forget why they came, or how to leave.

Honeybloom is located northwest of [Fortune's Rest](<./fortune-s-rest.md>), and northeast of [Gleamwater](<./gleamwater.md>).

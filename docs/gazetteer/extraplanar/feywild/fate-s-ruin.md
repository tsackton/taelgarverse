# Fate's Ruin
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Fey](<../../../species/extraplanar/fey.md>) realm in the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/feywild.md>), [Multiverse](<../../../cosmology/multiverse.md>)  
</div>


A fey realm west of [Fortune's Rest](<./fortune-s-rest.md>), described in [The Lore of the Feywild](<../../../things/books/the-lore-of-the-feywild.md>) as a place steeped in decay, a land where all things, no matter how great, crumble to dust in time. Travelers whisper of a mysterious Baron, whose mere touch hastens the inevitable withering of all to dust, yet none dare to speak his name aloud, lest they draw his gaze.

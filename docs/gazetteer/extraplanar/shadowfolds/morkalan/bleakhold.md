    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village in [Morkalan](<./morkalan.md>), [Shadowfolds](<../../../../cosmology/demiplanes-and-echo-realms/shadowfolds.md>), the [Echo Realms](<../../../../cosmology/demiplanes-and-echo-realms/echo-realms.md>)  
</div>


A dismal Dwarven village along the [Muddy River](<./muddy-river.md>), in the [Shadowfolds](<../../../../cosmology/demiplanes-and-echo-realms/shadowfolds.md>) domain of [Morkalan](<./morkalan.md>). 


It was described by the dwarves who were rescued from Morkalan as a large village, home to maybe 800 people. However, it usually felt much smaller, as few ever left their homes, except at need, to fetch water or harvest the wild grasses and rice that grew along the [Muddy River](<./muddy-river.md>) and seemed to provide sufficient sustenance for what passed for life in [Morkalan](<./morkalan.md>). It was tunneled into the cliffs, although a large number of buildings were also poorly constructed of mud and stone along the river's edge.

Greater Voltara is the richest and most powerful of the [Northern Provinces](<./northern-provinces.md>) of the [Chardonian Empire](<../../greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>). The primary city and provincial seat is [Voltara](<voltara/voltara.md>), a walled city rich from the chalyte wealth in the surrounding hills. 

Greater Voltara extends in the east to the [Snake River](<../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/snake-river.md>), in the west to the [Fiamatara Mountains](<../fiamatara-mountains/fiamatara-mountains.md>), and in the south to the [Kelvaros](<../../major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/kelvaros.md>) river area. The northern border of Greater Voltara is not well-defined, but functionally includes the hills north of Voltara (a rich source of chalyte), and the southern edge of the [Fiamatara Mountains](<../fiamatara-mountains/fiamatara-mountains.md>).

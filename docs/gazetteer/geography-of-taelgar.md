# The World of Taelgar

The world of Taelgar is a globe, slightly bigger than Earth, with Earth-like seasons and climate. Thousands of years ago, there were three large landmasses: Hkar, the birthplace of [humanity](<../species/humans/humans.md>), and the ~Northern Continent~ and ~Southern Continent~. Then came the [Downfall](<../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>) and the sinking of Hkar, and all that is known today is the ~Northern Continent~, which stretches from just south of the equator to the frozen north, covering almost 80 degrees of latitude and over 4,000 miles from east to west and from north to south. 

The ~Northern Continent~, is surrounded by four major bodies of water, which largely define the boundaries of the known world:
* To the west, the [Endless Ocean](<endless-ocean/endless-ocean.md>) stretches for thousands of miles of trackless oceans
* To the south, along the south coast of [Dunmar](<greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), the [Sea of Storms](<greater-dunmar/sea-of-storms.md>) stretches south and west, to the shattered shores of the ancient, now sunken, continent of Hkar. What lies south of the Sea of Storms is not known: the remains of the ~Southern Continent~, a trackless ~Southern Ocean~, or something stranger and more mysterious? 
* To the north is an icy, cold place where few travel, of frozen tundra and large forests. 
* To the east, the ~Eastern Ocean~ is separated from the [Green Sea](<./green-sea.md>) by the mysterious ~Eastern Islands~. 

The ~Northern Continent~ is marked by four major, continent scale features:
* In the east, the [Green Sea](<./green-sea.md>) extends from the ~Eastern Ocean~ to nearly the middle of the continent, forming a great sea stretching 3000 miles from end to end. 
* South of the Green Sea, the ~Great Desert~ forms a band across the southern part of the continent, stretching nearly from the [Sea of Storms](<greater-dunmar/sea-of-storms.md>) to the ~Eastern Ocean~. 
* West of the Green Sea, the high peaks of the [Sentinels](<sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) run nearly the entire length of the continent from north to south, and split the [West Coast](<west-coast/west-coast-region.md>) and the mighty [Chasa](<chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/chasa.md>)-Nahadi river basin the [Sembaran rivers](<greater-sembara/greater-sembara.md>) and the  [Green Sea](<./green-sea.md>)
* Running for nearly 2,000 miles from the [Mostreve Hills](<greater-sembara/mostreve-hills.md>) to the [Sea of Storms](<greater-dunmar/sea-of-storms.md>), the [Istaros](<istaros-watershed/rivers/istaros.md>)-[Istaros](<istaros-watershed/rivers/istaros.md>) river system, runs through borderlands and the [Desolation of Cha'mutte](<istaros-watershed/desolation-of-cha-mutte.md>), a wasteland that arose in the aftermath of the [Great War](<../events/1500s/great-war.md>)

Broadly then, the known world can be divided up into several major regions:

* The [West Coast](<west-coast/west-coast-region.md>), the coastal lands and peninsulas on the western shores of the ~Northern Continent~ including the [Apporia](<west-coast/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>), the [Mawakel Peninsula](<west-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>), and the lands along the shores of the ~North Bay~, and as far south as the [Nevos Sea](<west-coast/nevos-sea.md>)
* The [Chasa](<chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/chasa.md>)-Nahadi river basin, flowing from the high peaks of the [Sentinels](<sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) towards the [Endless Ocean](<endless-ocean/endless-ocean.md>)
* The [Dunmari Basin](<greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>) and the 

- The [West Coast Region](<west-coast/west-coast-region.md>), stretching from the the [Endless Ocean](<endless-ocean/endless-ocean.md>) to the [Sentinel Range](<sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) and including the coastal islands in the Endless Sea

- The [Western Green Sea Region](<western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>), stretching from the [Sentinels](<sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) west to [Irrla](<eastern-green-sea/irrla.md>) in the [Green Sea](<./green-sea.md>)
- The [Eastern Green Sea Region](<eastern-green-sea/eastern-green-sea-region.md>)], stretching from [Irrla](<eastern-green-sea/irrla.md>) east to the mysterious ~Eastern Islands~
* The [Far North](<far-north/far-north.md>), covering the frozen north 
* The [Far South](<far-south/far-south.md>), stretching from the ~Great Desert~ south to the ~Southern Ocean~
* The [Greater Dunmar](<greater-dunmar/greater-dunmar.md>), stretching from the southern end of [Sentinels](<sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) to the [Sea of Storms](<greater-dunmar/sea-of-storms.md>)
* The [Central Highlands Region](<sentinel-range/central-highlands-region.md>), including the [Sentinel Range](<sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) and the areas on the western slopes of the [Sentinels](<sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) 

Beyond the ~Southern Ocean~ is the mysterious ~Southern Continent~ of which little is known.Â

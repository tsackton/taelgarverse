# The World of Taelgar




The world of Taelgar is a globe, slightly bigger than Earth, with Earth-like seasons and climate and am Earth-like sun, Moon, and stars. The main landmass stretches from the [Endless Ocean](<./endless-ocean.md>) in the west across more than 5,000 miles of mountains, forests, rivers, swamps, farmland, desolation and deserts to the mysterious east.  

Many mapmakers consider the mighty [Sentinel Range](<./sentinel-range.md>), whose highest peaks rise more than 20,000 feet into the air, the defining feature of the land. The [Sentinel's](<./sentinel-range.md>) 2,500 miles of mountains and foothills divide the world into three: 
* to the west, [Chardon](<greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), the great city of magic and learning, by the mouth of the the mighty Chasa-Nahadi Watershed, and the smaller [Yeraad River](<major-rivers/yeraad-river-basin.md>), to the south
* to the south, the great [Dunmari Basin](<greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dunmari-basin.md>), arid and windswept, cut off from the [Nevos Sea](<nevos-and-apporia/nevos-sea.md>) by the [Yuvanti Mountains](<greater-dunmar/yuvanti-mountains.md>)
* to the east, the [realms of Sembara, Tyrwingha, and Vostok](<greater-sembara/greater-sembara.md>) on the shores of the [Western Gulf](<greater-sembara/western-gulf.md>) of the [Green Sea](<./green-sea.md>)

The halflings navigating the [Green Sea](<./green-sea.md>) would tell a different tale, as they sailed the 3,000 miles of rugged coasts, mysterious islands, and northern forests. They would talk of the [northern forests](<northern-green-sea/northern-green-sea.md>), the mysterious island of [Irrla](<eastern-green-sea/irrla.md>), the volcanic [Skaerhem](<western-green-sea/skaerhem/skaerhem.md>), and the Cymean Peninsula, steeped in history. They would tell you that the familiar lands of [Sembara and Tollen](<greater-sembara/greater-sembara.md>) are just the beginning of never-ending road, running through the waves and currents of the [Green Sea](<./green-sea.md>).

If you were lucky enough to find a ancient map from [Drankor](<../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), the ruined and haunted center of a once-mighty empire, it would show you that the [Istaros](<major-rivers/istaros.md>), flowing for nearly 2,000 miles from the [Mostreve Hills](<greater-sembara/mostreve-hills.md>) to the shores of the [Sea of Storms](<drankorian-hinterland/sea-of-storms.md>), was the lifeblood of fortune and empire. Today though, the river runs only through the fallen city of [Isingue](<upper-istaros/isingue.md>), and many other places that were once fertile and beautiful, that are now cursed by [plague](<upper-istaros/plaguelands.md>) and [desolation](<drankorian-hinterland/desolation-of-cha-mutte.md>).

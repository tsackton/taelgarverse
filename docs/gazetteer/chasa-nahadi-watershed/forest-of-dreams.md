# The Forest of Dreams
>[!info]+ Information
> A  place in [Ainumarya](<./ainumarya.md>), [Central Highlands Region](<../sentinel-range/central-highlands-region.md>)

A mysterious forest on the slopes of the [Sentinel Range](<../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), where few [humans](<../../species/humans/humans.md>) travel, and a part of the great forest of [Ainumarya](<./ainumarya.md>). Rumored to be where many surviving [elves](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) live. The Forest of Dreams lies north of the [Crimson Forest](<./crimson-forest.md>) and the [Elderwood](<./elderwood.md>), and south of what is now the [Forest of Nightmares](<../far-north/forest-of-nightmares.md>).

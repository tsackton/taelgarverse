# The Crimson Forest
>[!info]+ Information
> 
>> 

A mostly-uninhabited forest, stretching from [Lake Valandros](<./lake-valandros.md>) in the west to the [Sentinel Range](<../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) in the east, and between the [Elderwood](<./elderwood.md>) to the south and the [Forest of Dreams](<./forest-of-dreams.md>) to the north. 

Once part of the vast unbroken forest known as [Ainumarya](<./ainumarya.md>), the Crimson Forest was the site of some of the most intense fighting during the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and the battles that followed during the ~ConclaveWar~. 

Named after the rumors that the trees ran red with the blood of the [elves](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) and their allies in the fighting that took place here.

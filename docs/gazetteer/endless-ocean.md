The Endless Ocean is the name given to the ocean that stretches west from the [West Coast Region](<west-coast/west-coast-region.md>), forming the primary coastline of the [Chardonian Empire](<west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>), the [Mawar Confederacy](<west-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawar-confederacy.md>), and other places in the region. 

Some say one can sail west so far as to arrive at the eastern shores of the [Green Sea](<./green-sea.md>). Others claim the ocean is truly endless, or that eventually you sail into the border realms between the [Material Plane](<../cosmology/multiverse/material-plane.md>) and the [Elemental Plane of Water](<../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-plane-of-water.md>). 

Whether there are lost islands or strange lands far across the Endless Ocean is not recorded by scholars.

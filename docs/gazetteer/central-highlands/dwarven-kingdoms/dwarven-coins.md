## Dwarven Coins

Dwarven mints in the kingdoms of [Nardith](<../../greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/nardith.md>), [Nidzahar](<./nidzahar.md>) and [Am'khazar](<./am-khazar.md>) produce both coins and trade bars in a variety of denominations. Dwarven trade bars, stamped with a known weight of silver or gold, are commonly used for large transactions in [Dunmar](<../../greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), [Sembara](<../../greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>), and the Zimka realms, and are often seen in the [Chardonian Empire](<../../greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>), as well. 

Dwarven coins are minted in gold and silver in a variety of sizes and values. Dwarves also mint and produce iron trading coins, known as nibs, that are backed by a gold standard but not otherwise containing any intrinsic worth.

Dwarven coins were very common during the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and are therefore often found in ancient treasure hordes.

# The Crimson Forest
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A forest in [Ainumarya](<./ainumarya.md>), the [Central Highlands](<./central-highlands.md>)  
</div>


A mostly-uninhabited forest, stretching from [Lake Valandros](<../greater-chardon/lake-valandros.md>) in the west to the [Sentinel Range](<../sentinel-range.md>) in the east, and between the [Elderwood](<./elderwood.md>) to the south and the [Forest of Dreams](<./forest-of-dreams.md>) to the north. 

Once part of the vast unbroken forest known as [Ainumarya](<./ainumarya.md>), the Crimson Forest was the site of some of the most intense fighting during the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and the battles that followed during the Conclave War. 

Named after the rumors that the trees ran red with the blood of the [elves](<../../species/elves.md>) and their allies in the fighting that took place here.

</div>


East of the well-traveled ports of [Tollen](<../greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) and [Cymea](<../western-green-sea/realms/cymea.md>) lies a vast expanse of the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>). Many rumors come west from these lands: on halfling ships carrying exotic goods from [Medju](<./medju.md>); or on [Tollen](<../greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) merchant ships, chartered by the [Dyer's Guild](<../../groups/tollen-guilds/dyer-s-guild.md>) to bring exotic dyes from [Ursk](<../northern-green-sea/ursk/ursk.md>); or from restless [Skaer](<../western-green-sea/realms/skaer.md>) sailors, far from their home islands. These rumors tell of many things: islands that move from season to season; cities made of gold and emeralds that sparkle in the desert sun; flying kenku living in cliffside roosts on islands red like blood; stoneborn rafts, kept afloat by will alone, drifting from island to island; hobgoblin pirates who eat the hearts of their victims; strange gods of pleasure who bring waking bliss to their acolytes; clerics who worship the [Divine Presence](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/high-gods/divine-presence.md>) itself and can summon food and water by merely thinking a prayer. 

Are these rumors true? Surely some are, the people of [Tollen](<../greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) say, but few dare speculate on what is fact or fiction.

## Topography and Major Features

The [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) itself dominates this region, and the currents and winds of the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) are a major determinant of the climate. The coasts of the Green Sea define this region:

* [Irrla](<./irrla.md>), the large island in the center of the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>), 500 miles across, lies at the western boundary of this region
* The south coast of the Green Sea, from the mountains near Cymea to the mountains east of Medju, is characterized by a large peninsula known to be the home of diverse cultures
* West of the mountains near Medju is the far eastern coast, away from the influences of the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) and seen as strange even by those of this region
* Stretching for 2000 miles from south to north, the ~Eastern Islands~ form a barrier between the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) and the ~Eastern Ocean~. Many say these islands are magical, and the weather in this region is know to be chaotic and unsettled
* In the far north, is another great peninsula with cold, with long winters and short summers, and no reports have come west of who or what might live there
## Civilizations and Cultures
This is a land of many cultures and civilizations, but few are well-attested in the west. Most geographers believe that the cities of [Medju](<./medju.md>) are real, and shipwrecked sailors from the Republic of Svolhas on [Irrla](<./irrla.md>) have been seen on the Cymean Peninsula. But few really know what strange cultures this region holds, or what strange gods they worship.
## Climate
_See more: [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>)_

The climate of this region is dominated by the influence of the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>). The ~Eastern Islands~ are very oceanic, with strange magic influencing their climate. The northern coasts tend to be cool but moderate, heavily maritime climates. The south coasts tend to be dry, with little rain. Far to the east, beyond the ~Eastern Islands~, the northern lands are cold and wet, and the climate of the far eastern shores is unreported in the west.


## Major Historical Eras
Little is known of the history of this region, although the [Skaer](<../western-green-sea/realms/skaer.md>) and other ancient mariner cultures speak of their journeys through the eastern [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) in their legends and tales, and scholars agree that the ~Mariners~ were the first humans to settle in this region, sailing from [Hkar](<../../history/pre-downfall/hkar.md>), although whether across the [Endless Ocean](<../endless-ocean.md>) or from some other path, history does not say. All agree that the human settlement spread from east to west, and that in the ancient days before the [Downfall](<../../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>) much of the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) was covered by the enormous ~Ancient Lizardfolk Swamp~.

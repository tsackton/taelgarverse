-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } An island in the ~Eastern Islands~, the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>)  
</div>




The anchored island, where sea elves live and harvest magical salt from the warm tropical oceans on their shores.

[Shoal](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/guests/shoal.md>)'s homeland.

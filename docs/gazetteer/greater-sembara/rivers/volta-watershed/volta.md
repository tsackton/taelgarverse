<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in [Greater Sembara](<../../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


A major river that was historically a border between the [Sembaran](<../../sembara/sembara.md>) and [Zimkovan](<../../zimkova/zimkova.md>) cultural influences. The upper reaches of the Volta in particular have always been a center of [kestavan](<../../../../gods-and-religions/religions/northern-folk-religions/kestavo.md>) religious practice.

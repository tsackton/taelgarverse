-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A major river that was historically a border between the [Sembaran](<../../sembara/sembara.md>) and [Zimkovan](<../../zimkova/zimkova.md>) cultural influences. The upper reaches of the Volta in particular have always been a center of [kestavan](<../../../../cosmology/religions/northern-folk-religions/kestavo.md>) religious practice.

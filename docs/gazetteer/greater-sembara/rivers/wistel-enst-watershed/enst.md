-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in [Sembara](<../../sembara/sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A major river along the southern border of [Sembara](<../../sembara/sembara.md>). It is rocky, cold, and wide for much of its length, and has traditionally been a major barrier to movement. It floods often, and is crossed by only two bridges east of the "Three Fingers", where it splits into the [North Fork](<./enst-north-fork.md>), [Middle Fork](<./enst-middle-fork.md>), and [South Fork](<./enst-south-fork.md>): the ancient bridge in [Cleenseau](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), and a more recently constructed bridge just north of the confluence with the [Aure](<./aure.md>) at [Eskbridge](<../../sembara/heartlands/eskbridge.md>).

It is navigable as far upriver as [Rinburg](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>), and there is some riverboat traffic between [Rinburg](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>), [Fellburn](<../../sembara/heartlands/fellburn.md>), and [Eskbridge](<../../sembara/heartlands/eskbridge.md>), but it is not a river with a lot of boat traffic, unlike some of the other Sembaran rivers. There are few areas with adequate towpaths, and although it is wide and slow in places, the current is still strong enough that rowing or sailing upriver is not easy. Most of the traffic is makeshift boats escorting timber or ceramics to [Fellburn](<../../sembara/heartlands/fellburn.md>) or [Eskbridge](<../../sembara/heartlands/eskbridge.md>). 

The lower reaches of the Enst, in [Ozabal Swamp](<../../ozabal.md>) tend to be marshy and treacherous, and there is little to no river traffic beyond [Eskbridge](<../../sembara/heartlands/eskbridge.md>). 

There are ferries at [Rinburg](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>), [Fellburn](<../../sembara/heartlands/fellburn.md>), and [Stavenford](<../../sembara/heartlands/stavenford.md>), amongst other places.

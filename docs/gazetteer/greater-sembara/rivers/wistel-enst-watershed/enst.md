# The Enst
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in [Sembara](<../../sembara/sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A major river along the southern border of [Sembara](<../../sembara/sembara.md>). It is rocky, cold, and wide for much of its length, and has traditionally been a major barrier to movement. It floods often, and is crossed by only two bridges east of the "Three Fingers", where it splits into the [North Fork](<./enst-north-fork.md>), [Middle Fork](<./enst-middle-fork.md>), and [South Fork](<./enst-south-fork.md>): the ancient bridge in [Cleenseau](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), and a more recently constructed bridge just north of the confluence with the [Aure](<./aure.md>) at Eskbridge.

It is navigatable as far upriver as [Rinburg](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>), and there is some riverboat traffic between [Rinburg](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>), [Fellburn](<../../sembara/heartlands/fellburn.md>), and Eskbridge much of which continues onward to [Tyrwingha](<../../tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>). The lower reaches of the Enst, in [Ozabal Swamp](<../../ozabal.md>) tend to be marshy and treacherous, and there is little to no river traffic beyond Eskbridge. 

There are ferries at [Rinburg](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>), [Fellburn](<../../sembara/heartlands/fellburn.md>), and [Stavenford](<../../sembara/heartlands/stavenford.md>), amongst other places.

-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river [Barony of Aveil](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>)  
</div>


The major river of the [Barony of Aveil](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>), it flows from near [Veltor](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/veltor.md>) just south of the [Aveil Ridge](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/aveil-ridge.md>) until it joins the [Enst](<./enst.md>) just west of [Rinburg](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>). It is generally fairly placid and slow moving, but narrow and generally not suited to navigation save by small raft or canoe. It very rarely freezes. 

The stretch from [Peydon](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/peydon.md>) to [Lake Rin](<../../sembara/barony-of-aveil/lake-rin.md>) is marked by a barge trail on the western banks, where horse-drawn barges can be seen carting wood and grain to Lake Rin especially after the spring floods.

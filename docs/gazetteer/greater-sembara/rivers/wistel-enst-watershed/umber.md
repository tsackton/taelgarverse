# Umber
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A river in [Addermarch](<../../addermarch/addermarch.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


The Umber is a slow-moving river that runs from its source in the [Westcliff](<../../addermarch/westcliff.md>) to the [~Main Aure Fork~](<./main-aure-fork.md>), which it joins near the market town of [Valcroix](<../../addermarch/valcroix.md>). The lower Umber passes through orchards and farmland, but the upper Umber is largely within the [Torvaine Forest](<../../addermarch/torvaine-forest.md>), and lightly settled. 

The Umber gets its name from its murky, brownish water, colored by forest silt.

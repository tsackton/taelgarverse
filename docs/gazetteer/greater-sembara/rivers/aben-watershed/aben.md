# The Aben
>[!info]+ Information
> 
>> 

The largest river in Tyrwingha, it runs out of the [Mostreve Hills](<../../mostreve-hills.md>) towards [Tafolwern](<../../tyrwingha/tafolwern.md>). The headwaters of the Aben are a hilly land of many small streams and a major garrison of the [Army of Mostreve](<../../../../groups/sembaran-army/army-of-mostreve.md>), the Aben Garrison.

The Aben runs for about a hundred miles through the Tyrwinghan countryside before the [Trellyn](<./trellyn.md>) joins it thirty miles south-west of [Tafolwern](<../../tyrwingha/tafolwern.md>).

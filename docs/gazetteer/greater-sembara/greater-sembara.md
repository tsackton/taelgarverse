</div>


This region of Taelgar includes the land west of the [Sentinel Range](<../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) and east of the [Western Gulf](<../western-green-sea/western-gulf.md>), from [Zimkova](<zimkova/zimkova.md>) in the north, to the [Plaguelands](<../istaros-watershed/plaguelands.md>) in the south. It includes the realms of [Zimkova](<zimkova/zimkova.md>): [Ardlas](<zimkova/ardlas.md>), [Breva](<zimkova/breva.md>), and [Lavnoch](<zimkova/lavnoch.md>) as well as [Sembara](<sembara/sembara.md>) and [Tyrwingha](<tyrwingha/tyrwingha.md>), and to the south, the [Duchy of Maseau](<duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>) and [Addermarch](<addermarch/addermarch.md>).

It is largely a settled land, dominated by the major river systems of the Sembaran heartland: the [Enst](<rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), the [Wistel](<rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>), the [Semb](<rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>), the [Teft](<rivers/teft.md>), and the [Volta](<rivers/volta-watershed/volta.md>).

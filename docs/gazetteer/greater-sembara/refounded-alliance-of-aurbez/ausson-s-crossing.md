    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } An inn in [Laicon](<./laicon.md>), the [Refounded Alliance of Aurbez](<./refounded-alliance-of-aurbez.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


A bustling inn in [Laicon](<./laicon.md>) that stills forms the core of the settlement. It was founded before there was a village here, as a trading outpost along the [Maseau - Dunmar Road](<../roads/maseau-dunmar-road.md>), where several cart tracks from the [Aurbez Plateau](<../../istaros-watershed/aurbez-plateau.md>) descend.  There is a large fountain outside the inn, said to be blessed by the Wanderer many years ago, and which always brings forth fresh water.

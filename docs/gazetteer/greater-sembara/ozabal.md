# Ozabal
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Lizardfolk](<../../species/lizardfolk.md>) swamp in [Greater Sembara](<./greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


A large area of swampy lowlands centered around the confluence of the [Wistel](<rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>) and the [Enst](<rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), which is home to a substantial [lizardfolk](<../../species/lizardfolk.md>) population. 

The Ozabal is the remnants, along with the [Latazaro](<./latazaro.md>) swamp, of the vast wetlands that once covered much of the Sembaran lowlands, before the [Downfall](<../../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>).

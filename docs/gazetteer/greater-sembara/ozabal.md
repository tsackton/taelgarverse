# Ozabal
>[!info]+ Information
> A [lizardfolk](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) swamp in the [Western Green Sea Region](<../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)

A large area of swampy lowlands centered around the confluence of the [Wistel](<rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>) and the [Enst](<rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), which is home to a substantial [lizardfolk](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) population. 

The Ozabal is the remnants, along with the [Latazaro](<../western-green-sea/cymea/latazaro.md>) swamp, of the vast wetlands that once covered much of the Sembaran lowlands, before the [Downfall](<../../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>).

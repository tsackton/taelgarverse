# The Temple of Kaikkea
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Skaer](<../../western-green-sea/realms/skaer.md>) temple of [Kaikkea](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>) in the [Free City of Tollen](<./tollen.md>), the [Western Green Sea](<../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea.md>)  
</div>


An ancient building in [Godshome](<./godshome.md>) in [Tollen](<./tollen.md>), built by the original [Skaer](<../../western-green-sea/realms/skaer.md>) settlers of this region long ago. The temple remains a highly sacred place to the Skaer, and a priest always serves to make sure that [Kaikkea](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/kaikkea.md>) can still be heard here. This is also the center of the small Skaer community in [Tollen](<./tollen.md>).

The temple is a striking circular building of brilliant white marble shaped like undulating wave.

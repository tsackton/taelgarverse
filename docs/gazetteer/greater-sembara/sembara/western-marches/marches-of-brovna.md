# The Marches of Brovna
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A march in the [Western Marches](<./western-marches.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


This is a frontier land west of [Ainwick](<../barony-of-ainwick/ainwick.md>), and the lords here have as much in common with [Ardlas](<../../zimkova/ardlas.md>) as they do the crown in [Embry](<../heartlands/embry.md>).

A small river town in the Duchy of Wisford along the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), it is about 20 miles downriver of [Fellburn](<./fellburn.md>). There is a ferry here. Historically there was a significant fortification here, but the "new town" which was built in the 1670s after the hobgoblin wars dismantled the fortifications to use as building material.

Founded by [Cece I](<../../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) as part of a thanksgiving for her 25th year as monarch, for many years it was known as one of the better run orphanages in Embry. It was spread over two dormitories set around a central courtyard, a north dormitory for children able to work, usually aged 7 and over, and a south dormitory, for children too young or disabled to work.

Soon after Cece I's death, in 1713, the north dormitory was sold and all older children were dismissed. 


During [Robert I's](<../../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) reign it suffered for lack of funds, and the remaining dormitory building was sold in the summer of 1720 and the orphanage closed.

# The Heartlands
>[!info]+ Information
> A region in [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)

The heartlands are a rich agricultural region in the lowlands between the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), in the south, and the [Teft](<../../rivers/teft.md>), in the north. Much of this region, around the River [Semb](<../../rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>), is the [Duchy of Sembara](<./duchy-of-sembara.md>), a powerful and rich farming region, control of which is the source of much of the monarch’s power. This land is the breadbasket of [Sembara](<../sembara.md>).

Four other powerful duchies make up the rest of the heartland: the [Duchy of Wisford](<./duchy-of-wisford.md>), around the [Wistel](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>) River and stretching south to the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>); the [Duchy of Arnsbury](<./duchy-of-arnsbury.md>), in the north; the [Duchy of Cheimen](<./duchy-of-cheimen.md>), in the west between the [Semb](<../../rivers/semb-watershed/semb.md>) and [Wistel](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>) rivers; and the [Duchy of Seham](<./duchy-of-seham.md>) along the coast.

Perched on a bluff above the River Semb, the capital city of [Embry](<./embry.md>) is a bustling river port of approximately 50,000 souls. It is home to the royal court, trade missions from much of the [Green Sea](<../../../green-sea.md>), and bustling markets. Dating to Drankorian times, the city boasts that it has never been taken by siege, and the great northern gates are said to have been built by ancient Drankorian magic. It sits along the [Great North Road](<../../roads/great-north-road.md>), a major road running from [Wisford](<./wisford.md>), on the [Wistel](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>) River, north to [Embry](<./embry.md>), across the [Teft](<../../rivers/teft.md>), and finally to the Free City of [Tollen](<../../../western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>).

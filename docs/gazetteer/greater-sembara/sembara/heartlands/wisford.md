</div>


The largest city in the [Duchy of Wisford](<./duchy-of-wisford.md>) and the traditional seat of the Duke. It is a busy place at the intersection of the [Great South Road](<../../roads/great-south-road.md>), the Tyrwinghan Road, and the [Wistel](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>), and more cosmopolitan than most Sembaran cities. It is divided into two sections, the North Bank and the South Bank, split by the [Wistel](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>), and the ducal palace sits on an small island in the middle of the river, said to have been created as a gift from the gods many years ago.

    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A fortified market town in the [Duchy of Wisford](<./duchy-of-wisford.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A populous and fortified town along the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), it was historically the "second city" of the Enst, smaller than [Rinburg](<../barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>). However, since the [hobgoblin wars](<../../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>), Fellburn has grown substantially and has overtaken [Rinburg](<../barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>) to become the largest city along the Enst.

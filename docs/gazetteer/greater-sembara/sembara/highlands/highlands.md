# The Highlands
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A region in [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


North and west of Cheimen the foothills of the [Sentinel Range](<../../../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) raise the land. Here live sheepherders and goat herders, small free farmers, and a scattering of ancestral baronies. This land is split by the [Aine Hills](<../aine-hills.md>), a densely forested and rough highland that divides the watersheds of the River Semb from the watersheds of the River Wistel. Culturally the Semb watershed is often closely aligned with the northern parts of Arnsbury. This area is pocketed with free villages and small lords, and allegiances here are sometimes more aligned with the highland kingdoms than the Sembaran crown. The Wistel watershed is more densely settled, and is a land of with a stronger allegiance to the crown.  

Recent revitalization of trade has seen a growth in the importance of woolen fabrics, and a handful of baronies have seen their fortunes grow substantially during the peaceful years of Cece I. This land is especially welcoming to traders, and halflings are common here. Several halfling clans have established a significant presence, especially in the Wistel watershed, where regular caravans of goods travel down the river to Wisford, overland to Embry along the North Road, and then along the coast to [Tollen](<../../../western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>) and the [Duchy of Telham](<../northlands/duchy-of-telham.md>), where the wool is spun into fine fabrics sold all over the [Green Sea](<../../../green-sea.md>).

    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


A small village on the [Great South Road](<../../roads/great-south-road.md>) between [Dallet](<./dallet.md>) and [Champimont](<./champimont.md>). It was recently decimated by the [Undead Attacks in Sembara](<../../../../events/1700s/1720/01/undead-attacks-in-sembara.md>) and much of the popluation killed, including most of the lord's guard.

The zombies apparently wandered north towards [Cleenseau Wood](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau-wood.md>), and the village is terrified to leave their houses.

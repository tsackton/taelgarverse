    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A small village on the [Great South Road](<../../roads/great-south-road.md>) between [Dallet](<./dallet.md>) and [Champimont](<./champimont.md>). It was recently decimated by the Undead Attacks in Sembara and much of the popluation killed, including most of the lord's guard.

The zombies apparently wandered north towards [Cleenseau Wood](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau-wood.md>), and the village is terrified to leave their houses.

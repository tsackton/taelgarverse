    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } destroyed village in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A small sheepherding village along the Great South Road between [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>) and [Dallet](<./dallet.md>), about 20 miles from [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>). It was depopulated during the Undead Attacks in Sembara.

Before it was ruined, it used to be a common stopping spot on the road between [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>) and [Cleenseau](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), and the villagers here would rent out sheep barns and haylofts to passing travelers. There was a temple to [The Wildling](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wildling.md>) here, but it collapsed in the aftermath of the Undead Attacks in Sembara. 

_Distances:_
* to [Champimont](<./champimont.md>), 6 miles
* to [Essenmer](<./essenmer.md>), 9 miles
* to [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>), 21 miles
* to [Cleenseau](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), 39 miles

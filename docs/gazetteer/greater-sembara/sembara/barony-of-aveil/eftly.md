    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


A small sheepherding village along the Great South Road between [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>) and [Dallet](<./dallet.md>), about 20 miles from [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>). It was depopulated during the [Undead Attacks in Sembara](<../../../../events/1700s/1720/01/undead-attacks-in-sembara.md>).

Before it was ruined, it used to be a common stopping spot on the road between [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>) and [Cleenseau](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), and the villagers here would rent out sheep barns and haylofts to passing travelers. There was a temple to [The Wildling](<../../../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wildling.md>) here, but it collapsed in the aftermath of the [Undead Attacks in Sembara](<../../../../events/1700s/1720/01/undead-attacks-in-sembara.md>). 

_Distances:_
* to [Champimont](<./champimont.md>), 6 miles
* to [Essenmer](<./essenmer.md>), 9 miles
* to [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>), 21 miles
* to [Cleenseau](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), 39 miles

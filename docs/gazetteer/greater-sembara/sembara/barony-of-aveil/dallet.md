</div>


A pastoral village known for it's sheep and the first village of east of [Beury](<cleenseau-region/beury.md>) along the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). It is built about 500 feet north of the main road, and has three notable buildings: the large manor house, a blacksmith, and a mill. The area east of Dallet along the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) is good pasture, although there are no river crossing here and the area south of the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) is largely unpopulated scrublands. 

It is a common stopping spot for travelers, who generally prefer to cross the [East Bog](<cleenseau-region/east-bog.md>) in a single day. 

The current lord is Lady [Elodie Blanchard](<../../../../people/sembarans/elodie-blanchard.md>).

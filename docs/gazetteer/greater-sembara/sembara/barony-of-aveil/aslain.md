Aslain is a busy market town at the confluence of the [Auberonne](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/auberonne.md>) and [Leandre](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/leandre.md>) rivers in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>). The town, and much of the farmland to the east along the banks of the [Auberonne](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/auberonne.md>), is historically controlled by the baron of [Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>).

It is not fortified, and was rebuilt during the reign of [Cece I](<../../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) after the ravages of the hobgoblin wars, across the river from the ancient town of the same name, now in ruins.

Aslain is a busy market town near the confluence of the [Auberonne](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/auberonne.md>) and [Leandre](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/leandre.md>) rivers in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>). The town, and much of the farmland to the east along the banks of the [Auberonne](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/auberonne.md>), is historically controlled by the d'Aslain family.

It is not fortified, and was rebuilt during the reign of [Cece I](<../../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) after the ravages of the [hobgoblin wars](<../../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>), across the river from the ancient town of the same name, now in ruins. 

There is a large temple to [The Mother](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-mother.md>) here, and a small and still active temple to [The Night Queen](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-night-queen.md>) in the ruins across the river.

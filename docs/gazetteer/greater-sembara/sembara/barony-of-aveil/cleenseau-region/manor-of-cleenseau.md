    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A manor in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


The town of Cleenseau has an ancient history, but during the [Third Hobgoblin War](<../../../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>) the entire [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>) was overrun by hobgoblins, and the existing inhabitants slaughtered or fled. In the aftermath of the war, no heirs could be found and so the manor, as [crownland](<../../land-holding-in-sembara.md>), reverted to the Baron of Aveil. [Cece I](<../../../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) granted it to [Reginald Essford](<../../../../../people/historical-figures/reginald-essford.md>), a decorated solider and dedicated lord who worked diligently to repopulate the land.

The manor consists of the town of [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) itself, two hamlets: [Taviose](<./taviose.md>) in the eaves of the [Cleenseau Wood](<./cleenseau-wood.md>), and [Auloutte](<./auloutte.md>), a fishing village, and a wide swath of farmland for about two miles both up and downriver along the Enst. The manor collects income from its significant holdings of agricultural land, as well from a dockage fee for any fishing boats landing catch in [Auloutte](<./auloutte.md>) and a monopoly on the sale of charcoal in the manor. Additionally, the manor collects a toll for each axle of a wagon that crosses the Cleenseau Bridge and another toll at the gates of Cleenseau where the Old West Road joins the [Great South Road](<../../../roads/great-south-road.md>), only collected from travelers originating from the west, as well as another toll for those wagons crossing the bridge over the [Amance Brook](<./amance-brook.md>) near [Auloutte](<./auloutte.md>), for traffic originating from the east. 

A small market fee is also collected from several of the town markets, from anyone selling in the markets, including the food vendors along Char Street and the main town market east of the Market Gate.

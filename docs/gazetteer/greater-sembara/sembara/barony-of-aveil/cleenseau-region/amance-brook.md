# The Amance Brook
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A brook in the [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


Â A bubbling brook that runs into the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) near [Aulout](<./aulout.md>), with its origins somewhere in the [Cleenseau Wood](<./cleenseau-wood.md>). A narrow cart track runs beside it leading to [Valit](<./valit.md>). It is relatively easy to cross, but a sturdy bridge does run over it only the [Great South Road](<../../../roads/great-south-road.md>).

# The Amance Brook
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A brook in the [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../../../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


 A bubbling brook that runs into the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) near [Auloutte](<./auloutte.md>), with its origins somewhere in the [Cleenseau Wood](<./cleenseau-wood.md>). A narrow cart track runs beside it leading to [Valit](<./valit.md>). It is relatively easy to ford if you don't mind getting your feet wet or if on horseback, but wagons and caravans prefer to use one of the two bridges: the main bridge along the [Great South Road](<../../../roads/great-south-road.md>), and a smaller one in the town of [Valit](<./valit.md>).

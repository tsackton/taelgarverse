# The Amance Brook

Â A bubbling brook that runs into the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) near [Aulout](<./aulout.md>), with its origins somewhere in the [Cleenseau Wood](<./cleenseau-wood.md>). A narrow cart track runs beside it leading to [Valit](<./valit.md>). It is relatively easy to cross, but a sturdy bridge does run over it only the [Great South Road](<../../../roads/great-south-road.md>).

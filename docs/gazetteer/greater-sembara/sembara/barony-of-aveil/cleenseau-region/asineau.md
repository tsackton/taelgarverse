![Asineau Image 2](../../../../../assets/asineau-image-2.png){align="right"; width="320"} ![Asineau Docks](../../../../../assets/asineau-docks.jpg){align="right"; width="320"}A manorial fishing village on the banks of the Enst, two miles downriver of [Auloutte](<./auloutte.md>). The village is small, about 50 houses, mostly clustered a hundred feet above the banks of the Enst in a rough line, anchored at one end by a humble temple of the Wyrdling and the other by the manor house. There are three wooden docks, and a sandy beach where small fishing rafts can pull out, just before the banks turn marshy. There is no blacksmith, folks walk the 2.5 miles to [Beury](<./beury.md>) if they need a horse shoed or a plow made. About half the inhabitants of Asineau fish, and there are occasional disagreements with the lizardfolk in [Ganboa](<./ganboa.md>) when the catch is small. Much of the farmland is middling, at best, rockier than other parts of the region.

A few hundred feet outside the village is a small mill and bakehouse. The large stone manor house dates from the early 1600s, and stands alongside the road. There is a stable building attached to it. 

![Asineau Wrydling Painting](../../../../../assets/asineau-wrydling-painting.jpg){align="right"; width="320"}The temple to [The Wyrdling](<../../../../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wyrdling.md>) here is known for a chaotic painting on the wall, and is said to have been standing in this spot for over 500 years. There are two local miracles celebrated in Asineau: the [Miracle of the Hopeful Heat](<../../../../../gods-and-religions/holidays-and-festivals/miracle-of-the-hopeful-heat.md>) and the [Miracle of the Guided Wanderers](<../../../../../gods-and-religions/holidays-and-festivals/miracle-of-the-guided-wanderers.md>)

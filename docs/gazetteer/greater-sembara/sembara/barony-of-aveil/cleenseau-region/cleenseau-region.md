# The Cleenseau Region
>[!info]+ Information
> A  region in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)

The Cleenseau region is the area around the significant market town of [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), nestled on the north bank of the River Enst, bounded by the River Enst in the south, the [Cleenseau Wood](<./cleenseau-wood.md>) in the north, [Rinburg](<../rinburg.md>) in the east, and [Taviose](<./taviose.md>) in the west.

The river Enst dominates the landscape. It runs swiftly in the spring as snowmelt from the mountains and spring rains pour towards the sea, and in the spring, flooding is frequent. This far upstream, the river is shallow and wide, the shoals often shift, making navigation to the sea impossible this far upriver. The lifeblood of the region are the two major roads that intersect just outside the gates: the Great South Road and the South Watch Road.  

The nearest villages to Cleenseau along the road to the east are the fishing villages of [Aulout](<./aulout.md>) and [Asineau](<./asineau.md>), nestled along the riverbank, and [Valit](<./valit.md>), an hour’s walk north of the road. A small brook, the [Amance](<./amance-brook.md>), crosses the road here, and the track to [Valit](<./valit.md>) runs north along this brook. A marshy bend in the Enst beyond [Asineau](<./asineau.md>) is the home to [Ganboa](<./ganboa.md>), a small community of lizardfolk, who are often seen along the riverbanks as far west as [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>). Beyond the marsh is the village of [Beury](<./beury.md>), a full day’s walk to the east. Beyond [Beury](<./beury.md>) the land is wetter and poorly drained, and the villages are less frequent for the next fifteen miles, as the road passes through marshes and waterlogged abandoned villages, said to be haunted by the ghosts of those who died in the Blood Years. This part of the road is travelled over swiftly, and always in daylight.  

Beyond the marshes the land improves, and there is much good sheepland around the pastoral village of [Dallet](<./dallet.md>), and then beyond that a string of fishing villages and farming towns until, 30 miles past Dallet, the town of [Rinburg](<../rinburg.md>), at the head of navigation of the Enst.

Further west, the Gastant farm two miles down the old west road, and the South Watch Road runs past Tavoise, a small hamlet on the edge of the [Wood](<./cleenseau-wood.md>), and then continues roughly straight for 80 miles through the wilderness to [Dunfry](<../../western-marches/dunfry.md>). 

To the southwest a small track runs along the Enst, but it peters out after two days. Folks say it used to go all the way to the North Fork, a branch of the Enst some hundred and fifty miles away, but now it has been reclaimed by the wild. 

To the south, the rocky shrubland dominates for a hundred miles, before reaching the rolling valleys near [Valarin](<../../../duchy-of-maseau/valarin.md>), where most of the people of [Maseau](<../../../duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>) live. The road used to be dotted with inns and waystations, but these have fallen into disrepair since the Great War. This stretch of road is often called Bandit’s Way, and many ex-soliders make a living escorting caravans between Cleenseau and Evis, the northernmost settlement in Maseau along the Great South Road.

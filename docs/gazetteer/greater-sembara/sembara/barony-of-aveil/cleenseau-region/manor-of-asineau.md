# The Manor of Asineau

   :material-calendar: Founded DR 1651 (98 years ago)  
    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A manor in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


The Manor of Asineau was created after the [hobgoblin wars](<../../../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>) as a reward for [Sarabeth Asa](<../../../../../people/sembarans/sarabeth-asa.md>), a scout and spellcaster who distinguished herself during the wars. She never settled into manorial life, and disappeared in 1667, leaving behind her wife and young heir, [Lucas Asa](<../../../../../people/sembarans/lucas-asa.md>), who disappeared with his family in 1715.

Since 1715, the manor has been ruled by [Lorin Valbert](<../../../../../people/sembarans/lorin-valbert.md>), who has not been an effective lord. He has had a tendency to sell off land to fund the import of luxuries, and the manorial demesne is quite depleted. In response, [Lorin Valbert](<../../../../../people/sembarans/lorin-valbert.md>) has started to impose a market tax on flour, bread, and charcoal, which has not been popular, and well as a tax each spring on any fishing boats. 

Lorin maintains only a small guard, and has appointed himself magistrate, but is not well known for his sense of justice.

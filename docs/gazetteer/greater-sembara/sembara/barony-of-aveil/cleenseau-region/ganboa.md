    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Lizardfolk](<../../../../../species/lizardfolk.md>) village in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../../../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


A small lizardfolk village a few miles downstream on the Enst, known in [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>) as a good source of healing herbs. Several lizardfolk from Ganboa are regulars at the markets in [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) and [Beury](<./beury.md>).  Ganboa is built on a cul-de-sac in the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) where the banks become very marshy and the river splits and a northerly channel meanders through several large marshy flats. It is a small village of only about a two dozen huts, about half scattered across the semi-permanent marsh islands, and the other half along the banks of the river. 

A small community of fisherfolk in [Asineau](<./asineau.md>) has been known to grumble about lizardfolk getting preferential fishing rights when times are lean, but relationships with the humans in the region as usually quite good. Despite good relationships, the lizardfolk of Ganboa tend to mostly keep to themselves.

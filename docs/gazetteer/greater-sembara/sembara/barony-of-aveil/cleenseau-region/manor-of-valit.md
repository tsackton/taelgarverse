# The Manor of Valit

The manor of Valit is part of the demesne of the Baron of Aveil and has been in baronial hands for many years.  It is a small agricultural manor, and mostly is known as the main place for baronial land records in the [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>). It is relatively small, and much of the agricultural land is held freehold, and thus it is the poorest of the four manors in the [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>). The manor borders the lizardfolk village of [Ganboa](<./ganboa.md>).

The two mills in [Valit](<./valit.md>) are controlled by the manor, and provide the main source of manorial income.

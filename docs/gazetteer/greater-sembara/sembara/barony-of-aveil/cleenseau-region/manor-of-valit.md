The Manor of Valit is part of the demesne of the Baron of Aveil and has been in baronial hands for many years.  It is a mostly known for two things: its three mills, and as the main place for baronial land records in the [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>). Although the manor itself is relatively large, [Amance Brook](<./amance-brook.md>) runs through the middle of the manor, and much of the land to the east of the brook is hilly and hard to farm (and hard to get to from the village over the one small wooden bridge in [Valit](<./valit.md>)). 

There is a small farmstead on the east side of the brook, near the woodlot that separates [Valit](<./valit.md>) from [Asineau](<./asineau.md>), which is home to a dozen people, and has recently grown to two sturdy wooden farmhouses and a couple of barns. The rest of the population of the manor lives in the village of [Valit](<./valit.md>). The manor is relatively poor, as much of the land is held freehold, especially on the eastern side of the brook. There are three mills along the [Amance Brook](<./amance-brook.md>), all of which are controlled by the manor, which provide the majority of the manorial income.

### Economy
Valit has a small section of good soils (on the west side of [Amance Brook](<./amance-brook.md>)) and substantial farmland that is a bit rocky or hilly and is farmed more in scraps and pieces, intermixed with berry bushes and small stands of fruit and nut trees. There is more millet grown here than in [Beury](<./beury.md>), but wheat and barley are also grown. There are few cattle and sheep, but a substantial number of pigs who forage in the eaves of the woods. There is a significant charcoal industry here, and wood is plentiful. There are bees kept here, although mostly for local consumption. Fruit and nut trees are plentiful, and in the fall game is fairly easy to find. Valit derives income from the baronial land registry in town, which draws travelers and supports the work of a scribe and a small papermill along the brook, from which paper is exported to the local region. There are also three other mills along the river that grind grain for Cleenseau and Tavoise.Â 

Valit has an informal market

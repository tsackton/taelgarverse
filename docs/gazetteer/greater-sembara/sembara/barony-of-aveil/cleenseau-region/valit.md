    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village in the [Manor of Valit](<./manor-of-valit.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A small village overseen by the castellan of the [Manor of Valit](<./manor-of-valit.md>) of about 50 houses scattered a little more widely than most of the other villages in the region. The most notable features of the village are the wooden bridge over the [Amance Brook](<./amance-brook.md>), and the three mills built along the brook, as well as the large two-story wooden manor with several outbuildings, rebuilt about 30 years ago after a fire. The manor complex includes a land registry, a temple to the Warlord, a stable, and blacksmith. Just under the eaves of the [Cleenseau Wood](<./cleenseau-wood.md>), is a small shrine to the Wildling.
### Notable Residents
* [Sabine de Brune](<../../../../../people/sembarans/sabine-de-brune.md>), the castellan and magistrate
* [Warin](<../../../../../people/sembarans/warin-the-woodsman.md>), her master of the guard and woodsman
* [Giselle](<../../../../../people/sembarans/giselle.md>), Sabine's secretary and keeper of the baronial land registry
* Henri, Odette, and Reynard, the three millers
* Julien Leclair, the steward to the temples, and his wife, a skilled carpenter

# The Cleenseau Wood
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A forest in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../../../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


The Wood as it is known locally, is an old growth forest, stretching north of [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) for what is said to be hundreds of miles. The fringes are used for firewood, charcoal gathering, and pig farming, but after a mile or two it becomes wild and trackless. It forms the boundary between the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), to the east of the wood, the [Barony of Dunfry](<../../western-marches/barony-of-dunfry.md>) and the [Barony of Usbourg](<../../western-marches/barony-of-usbourg.md>) to the west, and the [Barony of Ainwick](<../../barony-of-ainwick/barony-of-ainwick.md>) to the north.

There is evidence of a portal to the fey realm of Duskmire about eight miles inside the wood, although it has not been consistently open.

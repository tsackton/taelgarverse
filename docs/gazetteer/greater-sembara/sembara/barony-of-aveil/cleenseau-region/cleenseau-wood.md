# The Cleenseau Wood
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A forest in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


The Wood as it is known locally, is an old growth forest, stretching north of [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) for what is said to be hundreds of miles. The fringes are used for firewood, charcoal gathering, and pig farming, but after a mile or two it becomes wild and trackless.

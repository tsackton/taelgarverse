# Dallet
:speaker:{ .middle } *(da-LEH)*  
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A pastoral village known for it's sheep and the first village of meaningful size east of [Beury](<./beury.md>) along the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). The [Great South Road](<../../../roads/great-south-road.md>) runs between [Dallet](<./dallet.md>) and [Beury](<./beury.md>) for about thirty miles, most of which runs through marshes and waterlogged abandoned villages, said to be haunted by the ghosts of those who died in the Blood Years. This part of the road is travelled over swiftly, and always in daylight.  

The area east and north of Dallet is good sheepland, although there are no river crossing here and the area south of the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) is largely unpopulated scrublands.

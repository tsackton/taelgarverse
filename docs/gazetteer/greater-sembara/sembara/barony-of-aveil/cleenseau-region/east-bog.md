# The East Bog
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A bog in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A stretch of fifteen miles along the [Great South Road](<../../../roads/great-south-road.md>) between [Beury](<./beury.md>) and [Dallet](<../dallet.md>) where the land is soggy and the [Cleenseau Wood](<./cleenseau-wood.md>) comes almost to the banks of the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). There are no settlements along this stretch of road, and many rumors that it is haunted. A handful of abandoned villages stand in the muck, and occasionally shelter travelers or squatters with no where else to go.

    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A fishing village in the [Manor of Cleenseau](<./manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)

A poor fishing village on the banks of the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), a short walk from [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>). It is nestled on reclaimed marsh between the [Great South Road](<../../../roads/great-south-road.md>), [Amance Brook](<./amance-brook.md>), and the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). About a mile downriver from Cleenseau, just before the road crosses the Amance, it is part of the [Manor of Cleenseau](<./manor-of-cleenseau.md>). About a dozen boats fish for river trout in the spring and summer, from a makeshift dock rebuilt each April. The twenty houses here flood at times, save for the sturdy mill, built on the banks of the [Amance Brook](<./amance-brook.md>), and the small temple of the Warlord built next to the mill. 

### Notable Residents
* [Gideon Thorne](<../../../../../people/sembarans/gideon-thorne.md>), a prominent fisherman and part-time steward of the small temple
* Lucien, a skilled fisherman, quite knowledgeable about the river currents, who fished [Cedric](<../../../../../people/sembarans/cedric.md>) from the river
* Marguerite, the toll collector and miller

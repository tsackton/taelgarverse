    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village in [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<./manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)

A poor fishing village on the banks of the [Enst](<../../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), a short walk from [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>). It is nestled on reclaimed marsh between the Great South Road, Amance Brook, and the Enst. About a mile downriver from Clenseau, just before the road crosses the Amance, it is part of the manor of the Lord of Clenseau. About a dozen boats fish for river trout in the spring and summer, from a makeshift dock rebuilt each April. 

The twenty houses here flood at times, save for the sturdy mill, built on the banks of the [Amance Brook](<./amance-brook.md>).

# The River’s Blessing
>[!info]+ Information
> An  inn in [Cleenseau](<./cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)

A quiet place known for its fried trout. This inn is where the villagers from [Beury](<../beury.md>) often stay when bringing goods to market. It has a insular and local vibe, and although strangers are not unwelcome exactly, many prefer to stay at the [The Fox's Flagon](<./the-fox-s-flagon.md>) or [The Crossroads Inn](<./the-crossroads-inn.md>).

    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Sembaran](<../../../sembara.md>) inn in [Cleenseau](<./cleenseau.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<../manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


An inn and tavern in [Cleenseau](<./cleenseau.md>). Known for its strong ale, and boisterous bar. A gathering place of veterans and mercenaries who make a living guarding caravans, and numerous small, cramped rooms. It was originally built in the 1650s to house laborers working on rebuilding the town after the [hobgoblin wars](<../../../../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>). It was converted to an inn in 1665.

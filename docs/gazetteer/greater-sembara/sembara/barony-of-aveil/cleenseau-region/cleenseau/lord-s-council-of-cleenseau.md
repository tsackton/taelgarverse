The Lord's Council is an advisory group to the lord of [Cleenseau](<./cleenseau.md>), currently [Rosalind Essford](<../../../../../../people/sembarans/rosalind-essford.md>) for all practical purposes.  It is advisory, but Rosalind convenes it before important decisions and respects the advice she receives. It consists of:

* [Marigold Stonebridge](<../../../../../../people/halflings/marigold-stonebridge.md>), the owner of [The Crossroads Inn](<./the-crossroads-inn.md>), as an observer in the tradition of the Sembaran Royal Council
* [Jonathon Henwyn](<../../../../../../people/sembarans/jonathon-henwyn.md>), the steward
* [Ames Benthey](<../../../../../../people/sembarans/ames-benthey.md>), the captain of the household guard 
* [Annet Bybet](<../../../../../../people/sembarans/annet-bybet.md>), the chamberlain
* [Anselm](<../../../../../../people/sembarans/anselm.md>), the administrator of the Temple of the Warlord
* [Nicholas Wysson](<../../../../../../people/sembarans/nicholas-wysson.md>), the magistrate

[Ida Rosfeld](<../../../../../../people/sembarans/ida-rosfeld.md>), the captain of the [Army Garrison of Cleenseau](<../../../../../../groups/sembaran-army/army-garrison-of-cleenseau.md>), often attends and provides advice, but is not a formal member.

    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } An inn in [Cleenseau](<./cleenseau.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<../manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)

 A three story inn popular with traders and merchants, but often quiet when no caravan is in town. Known for neither its food (go to [The River's Blessing](<./the-river-s-blessing.md>) for that), or drink ([The Bandit’s End](<./the-bandits-end.md>) is recommended), it is nonetheless a comfortable, secure, and dry place to sleep, and it has a large innyard and stables for traveler's horses. The owner, [Selma Wisthelwind](<../../../../../../people/sembarans/selma-wisthelwind.md>) does host storytellers and music, although it is distinctly second to [The Crossroads Inn](<./the-crossroads-inn.md>) in that regard. The main gathering room however is large and cheerful, and Selma tends bar most evenings herself. 

The inn was founded during [Cleenseau's](<./cleenseau.md>) boom after the [war](<../../../../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>), as a business venture, but has changed hands several times and despite its large stables and innyard, it has a reputation in the local business community as a money pit.


[Viepuck](<../../../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) spent some time performing here, and is well known if not exactly loved by [Selma Wisthelwind](<../../../../../../people/sembarans/selma-wisthelwind.md>). However, the night during which he recited the tale of the Cleenseau Spider Attacks with [Celyn](<../../../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) in the audience was one of her favorite evenings, the only time her inn outshone the [The Crossroads Inn](<./the-crossroads-inn.md>) as the place to be.

    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A manor in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)

The Manor of Beury was split from the baronial demesne in the years after the Great War, and has been held by the Murtha family for five generations. It contains the richest farmland in the [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>) and the wheat and barley grown here is a common site at the [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) markets. The Murtha's have been careful stewards of the land, and much of the land is part of the manorial demesne and either farmed directly by the lord or leased out, which provides a significant source of income. The Murtha's employ the only blacksmith in the village and have historically discouraged competition, and collect a market fee from anyone selling goods at the Beury market. 

The Murtha's have also historically maintained a large manorial guard, who often earn coin for their lord by accompanying travelers along the stretch of road to [Dallet](<../dallet.md>), which can usually be covered in a single day, but is often seen as dangerous and haunted. There is a small inn with a large caravan yard, and many travelers leave [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) in the early afternoon, reach [Beury](<./beury.md>) by nightfall, spend the evening in Beury and then depart for Dallet in the pre-dawn, to cover the fifteen miles through the [boggy lands](<./east-bog.md>) before the sun sets.

All of the inhabitants of the manor live in the village of [Beury](<./beury.md>).

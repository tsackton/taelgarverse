    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A manor in the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../../../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


The Manor of Beury was split from the baronial demesne in the years after the Great War, and has been held by the Murtha family for five generations. It contains the richest farmland in the [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>) and the wheat and barley grown here is a common site at the [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) markets. The Murtha's have been careful stewards of the land, and much of the land is part of the manorial demesne and either farmed directly by the lord or leased out, which provides a significant source of income. The Murtha's employ the only blacksmith in the village and have historically discouraged competition, and collect a market fee from anyone selling goods at the Beury market. 

The Murtha's have also historically maintained a large manorial guard, who often earn coin for their lord by accompanying travelers along the stretch of road to [Dallet](<../dallet.md>), which can usually be covered in a single day, but is often seen as dangerous and haunted. There is a small inn with a large caravan yard, and many travelers leave [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) in the early afternoon, reach [Beury](<./beury.md>) by nightfall, spend the evening in Beury and then depart for Dallet in the pre-dawn, to cover the fifteen miles through the [boggy lands](<./east-bog.md>) before the sun sets.

All of the inhabitants of the manor live in the village of [Beury](<./beury.md>). 
### Economy
Beury has the best soils outside of Cleenseau itself, and grows substantial wheat and barley. The western part of the manor is also good pasture, and there is a cattle herd and sheep. The northern part of the manor has patchy woods and is a good source of berries. This is also where most of the basswood grows which makes a good, coarse fiber, used for cloaks, rope, and baskets, some of which are locally exported. Basswood is a flowering tree and a good source of nectar for bees as well, and Beury has substantial beehives.. Beury also collects mushrooms from the edges of the bog, as well as snails, both local delicacies. Beury also derives income from guarding caravans through the bog, and from foraging building materials (mostly bricks and good stone) from the ruined villages in the bog.Â 

There are a number of cottage industries here, most notably basketmaking, candle making, and leatherworking. The weekly market attracts buyers for honey, candles, snails, mushrooms, baskets, and cloaks and similar heavy-duty fiber goods. The locals buy ceramics, glass, iron and other metals, reeds and rushes, some fruits and nuts, charcoal and some lumber, pork, and fish. The leatherworkers in Beury attract outside clients, as do the caravan guards.

# The Aveil Ridge
>[!info]+ Information
> 
>> 

A small line of hills in the northern part of the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), it rises steeply from the [Auberonne](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/auberonne.md>) valley to a height of almost a thousand feet. This is difficult land to farm, with many granite cliffs rising 200' or 300' feet.  Outside of a few scattered communities of goatherders, this area is not populated.

It is known for two things: as a guerilla redoubt used by Sembarans during the hobgoblin wars and as a source of tin. There are two tin mines in the northern slopes of the ridge, controlled by the [Duchy of Wisford](<../heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>). The Aveil Road runs from the mining town of SÃ©lestat in the north side of the ridge to the [Wistel](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>) river.

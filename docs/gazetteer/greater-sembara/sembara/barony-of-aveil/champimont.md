![Champimont](../../../../assets/champimont.png){align="right"; width="400"}Champimont is the largest town between [Cleenseau](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) and [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>) and is known for its grand inn, [The Elegant Swan](<./the-elegant-swan.md>). It is a common stopping point for travelers along the road, and has several smaller inns and caravan yards.  There is also a large market once a month that draws people from as far away as [Eftly](<./eftly.md>) and [Dallet](<./dallet.md>) and an array of blacksmiths, carpenters, and other artisans. It set on a bluff above the river, and has neither a ferry nor a bridge. The land on the south bank of the river here is mostly uninhabited, and is a land of rocky soil, scattered forests, and small rocky hills. On the north bank, around Champimont, is farmland and a lot of pasture for sheep. 

The current lord of the Manor of Champimont is Raoul Montagu.

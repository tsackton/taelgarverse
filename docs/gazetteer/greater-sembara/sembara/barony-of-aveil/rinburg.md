    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A town in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A trading town at the head of navigation of the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). A busy ferry crosses the river here, and it is the only place to cross the Enst until [Cleenseau](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), sixty miles further west. The landscape around Rinburg is pastoral fields and farms, and there is much good sheep pasture within two days ride.

Rinburg is a free city, not under the control of any baron, and owes taxes and allegiance to the [Duchy of Wisford](<../heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>), rather than the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>).

*Distances
		to [Fellburn](<../heartlands/fellburn.md>), 100 miles
		to [Cleenseau](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), 60 miles
		to [Dallet](<./dallet.md>), 40 miles

A trading town at the head of navigation of the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). A busy ferry crosses the river here, and it is one of the few points to cross the river until [Cleenseau](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), a hundred miles further west. The landscape around Rinburg is pastrol fields and farms, and there is much good sheepland within two days ride.

Rinburg is a free city, not under the control of any baron, and owes taxes and allegiance to the [Duchy of Wisford](<../heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>).

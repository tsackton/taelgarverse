# Lake Rin
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A lake in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A large lake formed by the confluence of the [Auberonne](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/auberonne.md>) and the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), it is surrounded by pastures and sheep farms, and five villages dot the banks:

* Mirabelle, the smallest, on the north west side, near the Enst
* Chantefleur, along the north side, the center of fishing on the lake, with the largest and best docks. A ferry departs from here for Lynthia twice a day
* Enclaut, closest to [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>), a more of a lakeside resort than a working town, with numerous elegant houses where the wealthy of Rinburg live. Close to where the [Auberonne](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/auberonne.md>) flows into the lake
* Aubrille, on the south shore, near to Lynthia, in the [Barony of Estrive](<../borderlands/barony-of-estrive.md>). Founded recently, with a energetic young lord.
* Lynthia, on the south east shore, near the Enst, also part of the [Barony of Estrive](<../borderlands/barony-of-estrive.md>). A larger market town, and growing rapidly, although no where close to the size of [Rinburg](<./rinburg.md>)

The south western shore is reedy and marshy, and a small lizardfolk community -- Getxo -- has settled here recently

The lake itself is about 3 miles across, roughly circular. There is a navigation hazard in the middle of the lake -- the Rinburg Rocks, they are usually called, which is basically a big underwater rocky outcropping that is a few hundred feet wide and just a foot or so beneath the surface. Most of the rest of the lake is fairly deep, fifty or a hundred feet.

Windlea is a village on headwaters of the [Leandre](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/leandre.md>), where it flows out of the [Cleenseau Wood](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau-wood.md>) before joining the [Auberonne](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/auberonne.md>). It is primarily known for an ancient temple of [The Wanderer](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-wanderer.md>) about a mile outside the town.

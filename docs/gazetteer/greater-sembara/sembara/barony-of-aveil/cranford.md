    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A town in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A bustling village which has grown rapidly since 1681 when a bridge was built over the [Cranmère](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/cranmere.md>).

It has a small unnamed inn which caters to travelers, and the temple of [The Warlord](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-warlord.md>) the was destroyed in the Undead Attacks in Sembara.

The most prominent building is the large manor house with a elaborate garden, but second in prominence is the tollhouse complex by the bridge.

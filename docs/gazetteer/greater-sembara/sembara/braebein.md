# Braebein
:speaker:{ .middle } *(BRAY-been)*  
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A line of hills in the [Highlands](<highlands/highlands.md>), [Sembara](<./sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


The Braebein forms the western and northern borders of the [Duchy of Arnsbury](<heartlands/duchy-of-arnsbury.md>), and marks the beginning of the long climb of land towards the [Sentinels](<../../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>) that distinguishes the Sembaran [Highlands](<highlands/highlands.md>) and [Zimkova](<../zimkova/zimkova.md>).

The hills are a productive source of silver and marble.

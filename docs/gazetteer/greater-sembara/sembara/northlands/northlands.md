The region, between the swift and unnavigable [Teft](<../../rivers/teft.md>) and the mighty Volta was the old borderlands of the Drankorian empire, and today it still preserves a distinct culture. In modern times, much of the region is part of [Duchy of Telham](<./duchy-of-telham.md>), which covers most of the southern two thirds of the region, except for some scattered coastal lords with historic ties to the Duke of Sembara or the Duke of Seham. The northern parts of the region are a land of small lords and small towns nestled along the rushing [Teft](<../../rivers/teft.md>) or placid Volta. These townsfolk and their lords are often fiercely proud of their ancient bloodlines. History is deep here, and many families claim to trace their lineage back to Drankorian times. Timbercraft and metalworking are both particularly common here and lumber from the highlands is made into fine furniture in several small towns along the small streams that feed the [Teft](<../../rivers/teft.md>). The coastal lands are known for boatbuilding, and the chief city of the region, [Telham](<./telham.md>), nestled at the head of a small bay, is a shipyard of some note, supplying the halfling traders who crisscross [Green Sea](<../../../green-sea.md>) and the small Sembaran navy. Clustered along the coast, many of the small towns specialized in clothing and manufacture of fine clothes and cloth from wool.Â 

In terms of natural resources, the salt flats along the coast are a major source of wealth. In the areas north of the [Duchy of Telham](<./duchy-of-telham.md>), livestock is a major source of wealth, and cattle and sheep are raised in the more marginal lands along the borders with [Breva](<../../zimkovia/breva.md>).

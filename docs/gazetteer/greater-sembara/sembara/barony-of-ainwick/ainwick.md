-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A town [Barony of Ainwick](<./barony-of-ainwick.md>)  
</div>


A town in western Sembara, on the upper reaches of the River Wistel. This is an important communication and market hub for the upper reaches of the [Wistel](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/wistel.md>) river. Although the [Army of the West](<../../../../groups/sembaran-army/army-of-the-west.md>) is based further west, along the [Western Wall of Sembara](<../western-marches/western-wall-of-sembara.md>), Ainwick is in many ways the spiritual heart of the army.

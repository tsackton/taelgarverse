# The Borderlands

The Sembaran Borderlands is a name for the baronies between the Aure in the east, the Enst in the north, and the Mostreve Hills in the south. These baronies are mostly newly established since the [hobgoblin wars](<../../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>), and are traditionally quite loyal to the crown. 

They run, from west to east: 
* [Barony of Estrive](<./barony-of-estrive.md>), near [Lake Rin](<../barony-of-aveil/lake-rin.md>)
* [Barony of Montsé](<./barony-of-montse.md>), near [Fellburn](<../heartlands/fellburn.md>), to the west
* [Barony of Vauclaire](<./barony-of-vauclaire.md>), near [Fellburn](<../heartlands/fellburn.md>), to the east
* [Barony of Serest](<./barony-of-serest.md>),  bordered on the east by the Clavert River
* [Barony of Chantelierre](<./barony-of-chantelierre.md>), bordered on the east by the [Aure](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/aure.md>)

South of these baronies is the remains of the ancient [Barony of Vaubonne](<./barony-of-vaubonne.md>), bordered on the south by the Clavert River.  South of the Clavert River are the two border baronies: the [Barony of Brumecliff](<./barony-of-brumecliff.md>), in the west, and the [Barony of Mostrevé](<./barony-of-mostreve.md>), in the east.

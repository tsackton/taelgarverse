Brumecliff is one of several small border baronies south of the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). It was founded by [Cece I](<../../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) in the aftermath of the [hobgoblin wars](<../../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>) in land that was historically part of the [Barony of Vaubonne](<./barony-of-vaubonne.md>).

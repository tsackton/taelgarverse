-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A barony in the [Borderlands](<./borderlands.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A barony south of the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>), just west of [Fellburn](<../heartlands/fellburn.md>), it was founded by [Cece I](<../../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) after the land was reclaimed from hobgoblins during the [hobgoblin wars](<../../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>). Historically, it was part of the much larger [Barony of Vaubonne](<./barony-of-vaubonne.md>).

Abenfyrd is a small wooded village along the banks of the [Aben River](<../rivers/aben-watershed/aben.md>) known for its timber, and relatively prosperous because of it.

Not much happens in Abenfyrd save the yearly [Festival of the Miracle of the Mist](<../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/festival-of-the-miracle-of-the-mist.md>), a commemoration of a time when the Wanderer (it is said) used dense mists to lead a pack of trolls from the [Plaguelands](<../../istaros-watershed/plaguelands.md>) into the Aben, to drown. 

This festival does attract some people from other nearby villages, and the fair held for several days on either side is a major event in Abenfyrd.

There is a large temple to the Wanderer here, which occasionally receives pilgrams, miracle workers, and others seeking the Wanderer's blessing.

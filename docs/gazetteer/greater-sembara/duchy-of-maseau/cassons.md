-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A fortified border town [Duchy of Maseau](<./duchy-of-maseau.md>)  
</div>


The main town in southern [Maseau](<./duchy-of-maseau.md>) is the border fort of Cassons. Once an important town on the road from [Isingue](<../../istaros-watershed/isingue.md>) to [Embry](<../sembara/heartlands/embry.md>), it is a shadow of its former self and is dotted with ruins and abandoned buildings. It is a dry and dusty place, just far enough south to get choking ash storms in the summer, and the people eke out a meager living on the proceeds from trade along the Dunmar Road and food shipments from [Maseau](<./duchy-of-maseau.md>), designed to encourage a defense here. In the hinterlands of Cassons a small number of ranchers have established themselves along the ruins of the [Great South Road](<../roads/great-south-road.md>), and the forts of the Marcher Lords dot the ranchlands or several days' ride south.

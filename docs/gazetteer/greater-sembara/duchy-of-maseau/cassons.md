# Cassons
>[!info]+ Information
> A town in the [Duchy of Maseau](<./duchy-of-maseau.md>)

The main town in southern [Maseau](<./duchy-of-maseau.md>) is the border fort of Cassons. Once an important town on the road from [Isingue](<../../istaros-watershed/isingue.md>) to [Embry](<../sembara/heartlands/embry.md>), it is a shadow of its former self and is dotted with ruins and abandoned buildings. It is a dry and dusty place, just far enough south to get choking ash storms in the summer, and the people eke out a meager living on the proceeds from trade along the Dunmar Road and food shipments from [Maseau](<./duchy-of-maseau.md>), designed to encourage a defense here. In the hinterlands of Cassons a small number of ranchers have established themselves along the ruins of the Great South Road, and the forts of the Marcher Lords dot the ranchlands or several days' ride south.

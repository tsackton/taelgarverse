# Evis
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A fortified town in the [Duchy of Maseau](<./duchy-of-maseau.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


The northernmost settlement in [Maseau](<./duchy-of-maseau.md>) along the Great South Road. Evis is a fortified frontier town on the border of the March of Evis, ruled by the aging Marcher Lord, [Peyre Vayler](<../../../people/maseauns/peyre-vayler.md>), and his two daughters.  South of Evis, the land turns more fertile, and more populated, before eventually reaching the rolling valleys near [Valarin](<./valarin.md>), where most of the people of the Duchy of Maseau live.

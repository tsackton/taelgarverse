-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A shire in [Addermarch](<./addermarch.md>), [Greater Sembara](<../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


Carlinshire is the largest of the three shires that owe allegiance to the Earl of the Mostreve, and is contains the upper stretches of the [Umber](<../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/umber.md>), the higher elevations of [Torvaine Forest](<./torvaine-forest.md>), and the northern part of the [Westcliff](<./westcliff.md>). It is bordered by the Maseau Gap on the west, [Bramshire](<./bramshire.md>) to the north, the [Aure](<../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/aure.md>) valley to the east, and [Weskershire](<./weskershire.md>) to the south. 

This area saw heavy fighting during the war against the Dominion of Avatus, and was the only region of [Addermarch](<./addermarch.md>) to be partially occupied by [Avatus](<../../../people/historical-figures/avatus.md>). It is now a somewhat poor region, and rather neglected. 

The most significant settlement in [Carlinshire](<./carlinshire.md>) is [Valcroix](<./valcroix.md>), at the confluence of the [Umber](<../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/umber.md>) and [~Main Aure Fork~](<../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/main-aure-fork.md>). Smaller settlements, mostly villages, ruined castles, and the occasional toll-fort, dot the hills to the west.

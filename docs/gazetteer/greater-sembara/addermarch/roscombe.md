>[!info]+ Inns and Taverns in Roscombe
> ***The Traveler's Rest.*** The only inn in Roscombe, a well-built two story building against the wall, near the South Gate (where the road from Valcroix enters town). Run by Bertrand LeBlanc, charming middle-aged man, with a personal connection to the Wanderer. Efficient and organized, and a decent cook as well. 
> 
> ***The Raven's Roost.*** A popular tavern on the market square, where the locals hang out. Run by Madeline Brewer, a young woman, daughter of the old tavern keeper who died unexpectedly a few years ago. Madeline took over the family business and has been thriving. Known for their beer, and the primary brewer in town. 
> 
> ***The Toad.*** A slightly run down tavern, also on the market square. Known for music but a bit seedy. Run by Rhys Dafydd *(REES DAV-ith)*, an older man who's lived here forever and knows all the stories, but doesn't really put much effort into maintenance and has no (living) children (won't talk about family).

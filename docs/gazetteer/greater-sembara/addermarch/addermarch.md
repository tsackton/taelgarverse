Nestled in the Mostreve Hills south and west of Tyrwingha lies the border kingdom of Addermarch. One of the rich border provinces of the Kingdom of Sembara in the time before the Great War, Addermarch enjoyed the wealth that came with control of the headwaters of the River Aure, which forms the south branch of the Enst and was a major trade connection between the Insingue and Sembara. However, during and after the Great War, Addermarch was devastated, and much of its population fled, starved, or were killed. 

Originally a Sembaran border duchy, After the war, in the general retreat of the Sembaran monarchy, the Earl of Addermarch established Addermarch as an independent kingdom, and those closely aligned with Sembara, the Earl maintains ties to Tyrwingha as well, and has never formally resworn alligence to either crown.

In the 1550s, the population of Addermarch began to grow again, in part from refugees from the south claiming unfarmed land. A strong feudal system developed, driven largely by the need for constant defense against ever-present dangers lurking in the Plaguelands to the south, and especially the haunted [Darkwood](<./darkwood.md>) on Addermarch’s southern frontier. 

Now, Addermarch is a land of small farmers, foresters, and sheepherders, known primarily for its famed apple brandy that is traded downriver into Sembara, but also a significant producer of timber and wool. Enjoying favorable tariffs for its goods in exchange for its role in protecting Sembara’s southern borders, Addermarch is a close ally of Sembara.

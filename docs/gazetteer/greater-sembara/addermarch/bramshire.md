</div>


The smallest of the three shires that owe allegiance to the Earl of the Mostreve. Bramshire is based in the northern hills of Addermarch, south of the Sembaran [Barony of Brumecliff](<../sembara/borderlands/barony-of-brumecliff.md>). This area was intensely fortified in the DR 1600s when the [Shattered Ice Clan](<../../../groups/hobgoblin-clans/shattered-ice-clan.md>) occupied the lands to the north, and many castles dot the hills of this land. 

The largest settlement is around the fortified castle of [Ravignac](<./ravignac.md>), on high ground with a commanding view over the [Clavert](<../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/clavert.md>) river valley to the north.

# The Western Gulf
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A gulf in the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>)  
</div>


The Western Gulf is an inland sea at the far western edge of the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>). Separated from [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) proper by the narrow [Straits of Cymea](<../western-green-sea/straits-of-cymea.md>), and sheltered by the Cymean Peninsula, the Western Gulf sees few storms and provides easy navigation for the many [halfling](<../../species/halflings.md>), [Tollish](<tollen/tollen.md>), and other ships that ply its waters. 

While most of the Western Gulf is a relatively shallow sea, mariners speak of the rare deep canyon that may hold unusual mysteries in the depths. Indeed, the [Tollish](<tollen/tollen.md>) scholar Ishara Venn, writing in her most prominent treatise The Seams Between Worlds, claimed that connections to the [Elemental Plane of Water](<../../cosmology/energy-realms/elemental-plane-of-water.md>) could be found in the deep canyons of the Western Gulf, though no reliable firsthand reports confirm such rumors. 


Over its long history, the Western Gulf has seen many maritime powers, from the [Skaer](<../western-green-sea/realms/skaer.md>) to the [Drankorian Empire](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) to the [Cymeans](<../western-green-sea/realms/cymea.md>), lay claim to its waterways. In the current day, it is largely controlled by the navy of the [Free City of Tollen](<tollen/tollen.md>), which extensively patrols and interdicts pirates, keeping shipping lanes safe.

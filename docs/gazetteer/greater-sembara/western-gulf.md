# The Western Gulf
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A gulf in the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>)  
</div>




The Western Gulf is the inland sea at the far western edge of the [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>). Separated from [Green Sea](<../green-sea.md>) proper by the narrow [Straits of Cymea](<../western-green-sea/straits-of-cymea.md>), the Western Gulf tends to milder weather and easier navigation. 

In the 1700s, the Western Gulf has been controlled largely by the [Tollen](<tollen/tollen.md>) Navy, which extensively patrols and interdicts pirates, keeping shipping lanes safe. 

While most of the Western Gulf is a relatively shallow sea, several deep canyons may hold unusual mysteries in the depths.

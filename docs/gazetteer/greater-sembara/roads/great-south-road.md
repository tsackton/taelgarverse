# The Great South Road
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A road in [Greater Sembara](<../greater-sembara.md>)  
</div>


An ancient road that runs from [Embry](<../sembara/heartlands/embry.md>) to [Cassons](<../duchy-of-maseau/cassons.md>). In better days it ran south as far as [Isingue](<../../istaros-watershed/isingue.md>), and in the Drankorian era, was said to continue almost 2500 miles to [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) itself.

Although in poor repair in a few places, for much of it's length it is paved with wide, smooth stones with drainage ditches on both sides. According to legend many of the stones in the road are a thousand years old, and have never cracked.

# The South Watch Road
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A road in [Sembara](<../sembara/sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A new road, built during the reign of [Cece I](<../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) to connect [Dunfry](<../sembara/western-marches/dunfry.md>) and the [South Watch](<../../../groups/sembaran-army/army-of-the-south.md>) with [Fellburn](<../sembara/heartlands/fellburn.md>) after the [hobgoblin wars](<../../../history/third-hobgoblin-war-sembara.md>). Most of the road runs through unsettled land, although several fortified garrison-houses dot the road to support soldiers and messengers travelling the road.

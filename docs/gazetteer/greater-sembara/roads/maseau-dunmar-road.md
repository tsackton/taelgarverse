# The Maseau - Dunmar Road

It is 480 miles from [Cassons](<../duchy-of-maseau/cassons.md>) to the high pass over the [Sentinel Range](<../../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), and the road passes through three major areas on the journey. The first 140 miles run through the [March of Andonne](<../duchy-of-maseau/march-of-andonne.md>), a land of small-scale ranchers and marcher lords. Clustered along the road fortified ranchers, once the main defense from the Plaguelands. Today these ranchers are open and have grown into small villages and markets,  and the lords 50 miles or more to the south and east bear the brunt of whatever comes out of the [Plaguelands](<../../istaros-watershed/plaguelands.md>). Travelers are advised to avoid sleeping on the roadside, but rarely is it needed as the ranches along the road have developed into waystops and places of refuge, earning a second income as inns and taverns.

To the right (north-north-west) the land rises sharply to the Aurbez plateau, a very steep ride unsuitable for wagons. The higher elevation is slightly wetter and safer, and occasionally travelers see goat herders and shepherds tending flocks along the ridge. The road runs beneath the plateau ridge, several thousand feet below the high ridge from which the plateau stretches.

After a week or more of travel, the first river crossing is reached, the crossing of the Masance. Wide and rocky and shallow, there is no bridge here. In the winter months when the water is swift and cold, few brave the crossing. Spring brings floods and multi-day waits for a safe crossing, but in summer and autumn the crossing is usually quick – unless a thunderstorm brings a flash flood, always a danger in high summer. A small town springs up here in the warmer months with guides, conmen, adventurers, pickpockets, tinkers, and traders but it vanishes into the countryside each winter as the cold winds come and travelers mostly vanish. No lord rules these lands, although many of the people look to Aurbez. Rumors abound that Maseau or Sembara will attempt to establish a castle here and toll the river crossing, but it never seems to happen, partly because the fords shift each spring in the floods.

After crossing the Masance the road continues for another 100 miles before reaching the crossing of the Aursen. Along these 100 miles the terrain gradually rises about 1500’, and the crossing of the Aursen is at about 4500’ above sea level. This part of the road is the most sparsely populated, although a scattering of farmsteads and ranches dot the triangle between the Aursen and Masance. This land is dotted with stands of pine and aspen, near water, and grasses and dirt and scrubby vegetation elsewhere. The soil is poor, but along the rivers small scale irrigation allows for small farmsteads growing wheat and millet. 

At the crossing of the Aursen a major waterfall is visible just upriver, where the river cascades down 2000’ in just a few miles, as it falls off the Aurbez Plateau and continues its journey east. The small river village of [Aursen Crossing](<../refounded-alliance-of-aurbez/aursen-crossing.md>) sits at the crossing, and a ferry over the river provides service to travelers for most of the year.

Shortly after the crossing of the Aursen is the crossroads where a small inn stands, and the road splits: west to [Tokra](<../../greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) or south to [Karawa](<../../greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). The western road rises over the next few days until it gains the height of the Aurbez Plateau. The remaining stretch of the road crosses through the high plateau. The land is still dry, but pine trees and aspens are not uncommon, and elk are seen and hunted in the summer and fall months. (They winter in the Triangle, usually).

This is a land of small homesteads, often hidden in the mountains or even in caves, harkening back to the original refugees from Isingue. It is sparsely populated, but still denser but in one and two dozen communities, makes up more than half of the population of the Aurbez. The people here focus mostly on survival for wrestling a living out of these lands is hard work, and have little time for the politics of their brethren along the banks of the Aursen River.

After another 100 miles through the plateau, the road rises sharply over several days to the high pass and then descends into the land of the Stoneborn.

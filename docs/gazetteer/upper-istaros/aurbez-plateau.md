# The Aurbez Plateau
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A region in the [Aurbez and the Andonne](<./aurbez-and-the-andonne.md>), the [Istaros Watershed](<../major-rivers/istaros-watershed.md>)  
</div>


The Aurbez Plateau rises sharply just north and west of the [Maseau - Dunmar Road](<../greater-sembara/roads/maseau-dunmar-road.md>), and is several thousand feet higher than the rest of the [Aurbez and the Andonne](<./aurbez-and-the-andonne.md>) region. This is the heart of the [Refounded Alliance of Aurbez](<refounded-alliance-of-aurbez/refounded-alliance-of-aurbez.md>). This land is marginally better than the plains below it, protected somewhat from the ash storms, and with scattered streams from the snow melt on the [Sentinels](<../sentinel-range.md>), water is more plentiful than farther east, despite the lack of rain. The plateau is home to small farms, clusters of farming villages, goat and sheep herders, and wildcat miners. 

The biggest settlements are around the marshy upper [Aursen](<rivers/aursen.md>) before it spills off the plateau in a series of waterfalls just before the road crossing, although most of the people are tucked away in the foothills of the [Sentinel Range](<../sentinel-range.md>), especially the southern stretches.

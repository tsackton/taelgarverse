-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village [Refounded Alliance of Aurbez](<./refounded-alliance-of-aurbez.md>)  
</div>


A small village that has grew up around [Ausson's Crossing](<./ausson-s-crossing.md>), a large inn, in the late 1690s. [Ausson's Crossing](<./ausson-s-crossing.md>) is still the dominate building and still the heart and soul of the village. It is set across the [Maseau - Dunmar Road](<../maseau-dunmar-road.md>) and has become an important trading point for [Aurbez Plateau](<../aurbez-plateau.md>) scavengers who reclaim dwarven mining goods and ore from the ruins and dangers of [Ardith](<../../central-highlands/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>) and sell it to the outside world.

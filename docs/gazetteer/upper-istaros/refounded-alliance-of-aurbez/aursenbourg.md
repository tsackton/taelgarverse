</div>


Aursenbourg is a walled market town where the [Maseau - Dunmar Road](<../maseau-dunmar-road.md>) crosses the [Aursen](<../../major-rivers/istaros-watershed/aursen.md>), centered on a sturdy stone bridge built over the river in DR 1732. Now a major market town for the region, a generation ago this was only a small village known as Aursen's Crossing, where regular ferry service would shuttle caravans and traders over the Aursen.

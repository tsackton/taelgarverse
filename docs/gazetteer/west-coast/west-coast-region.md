-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A region [Taelgar](<../gazetteer.md>)  
</div>


## Overview

## Boundaries

The West Coast Region includes the entirety of the [Chardonian Empire](<chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>), as well as the [Nevos Sea](<./nevos-sea.md>) area, the [Mawakel Peninsula](<mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>), and the [Erbalta Plains](<chardonian-empire/northern-frontier/erbalta-plains.md>), plus the coastal regions west and north of the [Erbalta Plains](<chardonian-empire/northern-frontier/erbalta-plains.md>). It also includes the islands in the [Endless Ocean](<../endless-ocean.md>). 

- To the north, this region is bordered by the mysterious cold of the [Far North](<../far-north/far-north.md>). 
- To the east, this region is bordered by the ~North Nahadi River~, [Ainumarya](<../chasa-nahadi-watershed/ainumarya.md>), and the [Myraeni Gap](<../greater-dunmar/myraeni-gap.md>).
- To the south, this region is bordered by the [Sea of Storms](<../greater-dunmar/sea-of-storms.md>)and the ocean beyond the [Nevos Sea](<./nevos-sea.md>)
- To the west, this region is bordered by the [Endless Ocean](<../endless-ocean.md>)

## Major Features



- ~North Chardon Coast~: *The wide coastland north of Chardon. Canonically all that is developed about this area is that it is fertile agricultural land. This is approx. 38 N to 45 N latitudes. Probably the southern part is more strictly Mediterranean, with extensive cotton, olive, and wine production (Metium is a major wine-producer), while the northern part is highly productive for grains. Basic geographic/climatic outline is Mediterranean in the south transitioning to a more oceanic influence in the north, with grain cultivation in river valleys and hot-summer crops like olives in the hills. Probably should extend the oceanic climate of Mawar into the northern stretches of this area, around 45 N. Real world influences would include parts of Italy, southern France, and other Med agricultural areas, and California Central Valley.*
- [Lake Valandros](<../chasa-nahadi-watershed/lake-valandros.md>): *Huge lake, with no canonical details. Likely somewhat dry on the west side and humid and rainy on the east side, just from mountain influence. Probably also agricultural - rice production for example might be common.*
- [Mawakel Peninsula](<mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>): *See Mawar notes. Currently unresolved is if this is more of a Cool Maritime Climate (Cfb) with limited winter snow, as currently marked (analogy: coastal Ireland, Pacific NW), or if this is more of a Subpolar Oceanic Climate (Cfc) with heavy winter snowfall and limited agriculture (analogy: Iceland or Norwegian coasts). I guess I have leaned towards the former, with the further north coast beyond Mawar more of the Norway analog.*
- ~Great Bay~: *Lots of land northeast of Mawar. The east coast, near Voltara, has a bit of detail from Great Library campaign, but otherwise this is totally open and undeveloped.*
- [Alimas](<chardonian-empire/northern-frontier/alimas.md>): *Canon: center for chalyte mining - mountainous and arid with extensive plains.*
- [Tawir Forest](<./tawir-forest.md>): *So far just a name.*
- [Chasa River Valley](<chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/chasa-river-valley.md>): *agricultural mixed with forests, major population center*
- [Yeraad River Basin](<./yeraad-river-basin.md>): *southeast of Chardon, south of Chasa/Elderwood. Major lizardfolk area, mining in the hills that separate it from Chasa, and in the "Darba Mountains". Very little detail otherwise - probably fairly flat, hot in the summer. This is basically med transitioning to semi-arid in the east and south, likely supporting fruit trees near the coast, and extensive livestock, probably the center of the Chardon cattle industry.*
- [Apporia](<chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>): *Undeveloped until the kelp forest adventure off the coast.* 
- [Nevos Sea](<./nevos-sea.md>) and Emerald Bay: *trending into subtropics here*




## Climate

Most of the extensive coastline of the Chardonian empire, stretching from the mouth of the [Yeraad](<rivers/yeraad.md>) river to the southern fringes of the [Mawakel Peninsula](<mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>), is a temperate region with warm or hot summers and wet, cool winters(https://geodiode.com/climate/mediterranean).

# Eskorola
>[!info]+ Summary
> a village in the [Mawar Confederacy](<./mawar-confederacy.md>), the [West Coast Region](<../west-coast-region.md>)

The lizardfolk village, Eskorola, is a small community of maybe 50 huts nestled on the southern end of an extensive salt marsh (formed on the coastal side of a chain of barrier islands), most built on stilts but relying on the vegetation to protect from storm surges. Some huts are connected by wooden walkways or swinging bridges, but many require swimming. A few larger communal buildings cluster near the center of the village, set on a small artificial island, surrounded by marsh grass. Oyster farms dot the mouth of the bay and a tidal pool provides a harbor of sorts for the few larger boats (although most lizardfolk just use canoes kept by each hut, or swim).

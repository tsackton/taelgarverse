## Overview

North of [Chardon](<../chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), hugging the coast of the rocky, inhospitable [Mawakel Peninsula](<./mawakel-peninsula.md>), the Mawar people have lived symbiotically with the ocean for generations uncounted. Tracing their ancestry to the first peoples to leave [Hkar](<../../../history/pre-downfall/hkar.md>) ages ago, the Mawar once settled widely across the coastal plains and shores north of [Chardon](<../chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), as far as the northern coast of the Great Bay. But when the Drankorians spread north, they ceded the southern lands and settled largely on the [Mawakel Peninsula](<./mawakel-peninsula.md>) and the near-shore islands, maintaining an uneasy peace within the Drankorian sphere of influence.
## [History](<../../../history/chronicles-of-the-mawar.md>)

After the fall of [Drankor](<../../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), the Mawar became a significant coastal and trading power, and Mawar ships could be seen plying coastal trade routes as far south as [Chardon](<../chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) and as far north as the far northern shores of beyond the Great Bay. All this changed with the expansion of Pandar and the coming of Cha’mutte’s armies. During the [Great War](<../../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) and the chaos that followed, most of the inland kingdoms north of [Chardon](<../chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) fell into ruin. The Mawar survived by retreating to their coastal villages and relying on the protection of the difficult terrain of the [Mawakel Peninsula](<./mawakel-peninsula.md>) to defend them against attack. Most of the Mawar settlements outside the peninsula and the islands fell or were abandoned.

Now, the Mawar Confederacy stands proud as one of the few northern civilizations to have survived the [Blood Years](<../../../events/1500s/blood-years.md>). As the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>) expands north, the Mawar have again trusted to the inhospitable terrain of their homeland to discourage invasion, and [Chardon](<../chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) has so far considered the [Mawakel Peninsula](<./mawakel-peninsula.md>) an unappealing target for conquest. Indeed, the increased settlement and stability that the Chardonian expansion has brought to the north has also brought prosperity to the Mawar, and the Confederacy is slowly beginning to rebuild its trade networks and influence across the northern coast.

## Culture and Religion

The Mawar are an independent and democratic people, proud of their heritage and egalitarian and practical in outlook. The confederacy itself is governed by an elected conclave that meets yearly, with an administrative council and governance structure elected by the conclave to handle any necessary governmental tasks during the months of the year the conclave is not in session. Most villages are run by elected leaders, who are also sometimes the representative to the conclave, although larger towns often have an elected council instead. 

The Mawar depend entirely on the sea for food, travel, resources, and their livelihoods, and almost the entire population lives within a few miles of either the sea of the [Sulqat](<../rivers/sulqat.md>) river. So much of their culture and outlook is based around this relationship to the ocean. But they are not particularly mariners, as few Mawar undertake long ocean journeys and most of their seafaring vessels are designed to remain within a few miles of the coast. 

During the Drankorian expansion, the Mawar adopted the [Mos Numena](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena.md>) tradition, but their local form of this religion is a unique blend of the old northerner traditions and [Mos Numena](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena.md>). In particular, the old northern folk religions of the coastal people emphasized the importance of ancestor spirits in bringing prayers and messages to the gods, especially to Arhat and Malik. While in the modern day Mawar tradition the role of Arhat and Malik has be replaced by the [Eight Divines](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena.md>) of [Mos Numena](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena.md>), the culture of ancestor veneration has persisted alongside this tradition, and many great heroes of the Mawar are seen as demi-god like figures that can intercede with the [Eight Divines](<../../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena.md>) on behalf of the people, and bring their attention to the prayers of the Mawar.

## Gatza

A particular drug of the Mawakel peninsula is gatza, harvested from the livers of particularly large predatory fish from the [Endless Ocean](<../../endless-ocean.md>). Originally used by the lizardfolk of the salt marshes and tidal flats as part of spiritual ceremonies of communion, gatza gives those who take it the power to hear and even speak with the spirits of the dead. When taken in small doses, as part of a controlled ritual in lizardfolk communities, this is a powerful way to receive visions of those lost and explore the spirit world of the ancestors. 

But like many things, gatza can be abused. The visions of the spirit world that those who use gatza receive can be complex and alluring, yes. But the true addicts are typically drawn in by a deep grief over one who has died, a longing for lost loved ones, or a deep obsession with the powerful spirits of the past. The more one takes gatza, and especially when not taken in a controlled way, the more one hears the voices of the dead one obsesses over. But whether these are really the dead spirits one seeks, or malevolent forces seeking to take advantage of weak minds, is not always clear. 

Some people have even been known to get lost in gatza dreams, following their obsession to the bitter end, losing track of time and wasting away from thirst and starvation, locked in the visions of a different realm and unable to escape.

Gatza is taken in different forms. Most commonly, it is distilled and processed into a tarry mash that is smoked in gatza pipes.

# The Old Chardon Canal
>[!info]+ Summary


Variously referred to as the [Chardon](<chardon/chardon.md>) Canal, the Old [Chardon](<chardon/chardon.md>) Canal, the Great [Chardon](<chardon/chardon.md>) Canal, or just the Canal, this is an 87 mile long sea-level canal that connects the [Endless Ocean](<../../endless-ocean.md>) near [Chardon](<chardon/chardon.md>) with the Emerald Bay and the [Nevos Sea](<../nevos-sea.md>). 

Built with magic by the Drankorians, and currently navigated by windcallers, who use magic to steer ships through the often windless passage.

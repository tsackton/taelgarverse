## Overview

Voltara, the northernmost substantial settlement in the Chardonian Empire, is a walled town of maybe 2000 people. It is situated on a grassy lowland steppe east of the [Fiamatara Mountains](<../../fiamatara-mountains.md>), primarily supported by a large mining industry in the nearby hills, which are rich in chalyte. The grasslands are fertile land, and sheep farming and agriculture is common in the Voltara hinterlands. 

Access to the walled town itself is heavily restricted. However, a decent sized settlement has grown up outside the walls, oriented around the needs of the traveling merchant caravans that regularly depart carrying ore, precious metals, and more valuable goods extracted from the mines. Here, you can find taverns and inns aplenty, as well has a thriving bazaar.

Inside the walls, Voltara is a rich city, made wealthy on the chalyte trade. It is also a new city, largely constructed over the past two generations, on the sight of a sleepy frontier fort after the discovery of chalyte in the hills to the north. Many buildings are constructed of white marble, the streets are wide and clean, and the entire town has an air of opulence about it. 

## Precincts

![[voltara-outline.excalidraw.png]]

*Library (1):* At the northern edge of town is the academic precinct, which houses dormitories, a library, and various buildings associated with the archivists of the Great Library who come to study the inner workings of chalyte magic. The library complex is itself surrounded by walls, and overseen by Master Archivist Gaius. The wizard's gate leads north from this precinct. 

*Chalyte (2):* Southwest of the library precinct are a series of buildings and workshops involved in the sometimes-hazardous processing of chalyte ore, both for local use and for preparation to transport to Chardon. This area sometimes suffers from strange magical effects. 

*Baths  / Central  (3):* In the center of town is a large baths complex, and the main public market. The eastern part of this precinct, spilling into the temple precinct, is the wealthy part of town and dominated by manor houses and villas. 

*Temple (4):* East of the baths is a large temple dedicated to the Eight Divines. This is also a wealthy area with manor houses. The temple gate leads east from this precinct. 

*Artificer's Way (5):* South of the chalyte precinct, the street known as artificer's way runs south, giving this precinct its name, and terminating at the Waygate, one of the two primary gates to Voltara. While much of the chalyte mined here goes south to fuel industry in Chardon, Voltara has a small but extremely skilled artificer's community, largely centered in this precinct. The relatively minor Smallgate also exits west from this precinct. 

*Fort Hill (6)*: The southernmost precinct sits on a small rise, on the site of the original border fort that once stood here. The proconsul, who administers the city in the name of the Magistros, is based here, as are the old fortifications and parade grounds pre-dating the city proper. The city gate exits south from this precinct. 

*Outer (7):* A large fraction of the population of Voltara lives in slums and settlements that have grown up along the south wall and extending along the main road leading south from Voltara to Lake Valandros and eventually Chardon. This area has no formal name, but many informal ones, and has a much more rough-and-tumble frontier feeling than the city proper.

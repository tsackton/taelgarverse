# The Great Library
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A library in [Chardon](<./chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>), the [West Coast Region](<../../west-coast-region.md>)  
</div>


The oldest building and organization in Chardon, dedicated to collecting and preserving knowledge, often in the form of books and scholarly works, though the Great Library also funds adventuring expeditions to recover more esoteric treasure. 

## History
- 688 DR: *(Great Library)*: A small library is constructed in Chardon, known as the Sibyline Archives, associated with the Sibylinites, a secret order in Drankor devoted to secret knowledge of [The Sibyl](<../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-sibyl.md>). 
- 1063 DR: *(Great Library)*: The Sibyline Archives are expanded, nearly doubling in size, to accomodate books and knowledge saved from the fall of Drankor. Become known as The Great Library of Chardon

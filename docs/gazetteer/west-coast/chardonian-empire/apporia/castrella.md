-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A city in [Cedrano](<./cedrano.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>), the [West Coast Region](<../../west-coast-region.md>)  
</div>


Castrella is a dramatic city with a rich history, set on Castrella Bay on a narrow strip of flat land just south of the mouth of the Kedron river, backed by steep hills. The coastal land is dominated by the port itself, and a series of constructed breakwaters. Several dramatic waterfalls cascade down the hills to the north. There is a small bit of agriculture south of the city, across the Kedron and in the Kerdon delta area, but the wealth of Castrella derives largely from the sea.

The city is a bustling port, with a thriving docks and market. Although now overshadowed by Chardon as a maritime power, Castrella retains some of the energy of its historic past as the major maritime power on the Gulf of Chardon in the years before the Great War.

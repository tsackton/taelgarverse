# Portalia
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A province in the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>), the [West Coast Region](<../../west-coast-region.md>)  
</div>


Portalia is one of the three Apporian Provinces, located on the northwest coast of the [Apporian Peninsula](<./apporia.md>). It is the most Chardonian of the three provinces, as much of Portalia was destroyed during the War of the Dark Rift, and not rebuilt until it was liberated by Chardon at the conclusion of the war. 

Portalia is centered around the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>), which is the primary economic asset of the province. The [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>) coast is fairly marshy, with extensive salt marshes stretching in both directions from the mouth of the canal, which somewhat limits development, although the city of [Nevium](<./nevium.md>), built on pilings over the marshes, is the largest city and provincial capital due to tax revenue from the canal. 

Other towns and cities in Portalia include Pergia, on the southern coast; and [Artevus](<./artevus.md>), a minor fishing village near the northern border of the province.

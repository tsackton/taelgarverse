Apporia, or the Apporian Peninsula, is a very large peninsula that stretches west from the area between the [Yeraad River Basin](<../../yeraad-river-basin.md>) and the [Chasa River Valley](<../chasa-river-valley/chasa-river-valley.md>), and surrounded by the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>) to the northeast, the Emerald Bay and the [Nevos Sea](<../../nevos-sea.md>) to the southeast, and the [Endless Ocean](<../../../endless-ocean.md>) to the west. The [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>) runs through the base of the peninsula, providing a shipping route between the [Nevos Sea](<../../nevos-sea.md>) and the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>). 

The northern interior of the peninsula is dominated by wild lands of rough mountains, with deep valleys dotted with forests, where few people live. 

The northwestern coast, along the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>), is part of the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>), and is made up of three provinces: [Portalia](<./portalia.md>), [Cedrano](<./cedrano.md>), and Raziolo.

Cedrano is a rocky coastal province in the [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>), one of the three Apporian Provinces, located on the northwest coast of the [Apporian Peninsula](<./apporia.md>), across the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>) from [Chardon](<../chardon/chardon.md>). 

This is a land of rocky cliffs and tiny fishing villages nestled in small harbors. The interior is almost entirely uninhabited, dominated by rough mountainous terrain, with the exception of the Kedron river valley, which is dotted with some small villages and gives the province its name. The only significant city in Cedrano is [Castrella](<./castrella.md>), at the mouth of the Kedron river. 

Cedrano was largely overrun during the War of the Dark Rift, and [Castrella](<./castrella.md>) was besieged but never sacked. It was incorporated into the growing [Chardonian Empire](<../chardonian-empire.md>) shortly after the end of the war, in DR 1599, but granted significant autonomy.

Nevium is a bustling port city and the provincial capital of [Portalia](<./portalia.md>), built on pilings above the salt marshes along the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>) coast, about 10 miles east of the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>). Completely destroyed in DR 1589 during the War of the Dark Rift, Nevium was rebuilt in early DR 1600s and grew quickly into a thriving port after the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>) was reopened under Chardonian control in DR 1619. While the sheltered harbor and productive fishing grounds have supported settlements in the marshes around Nevium for a long time, the city itself largely dates to the first have of the DR 1600s. 

Nevium is a prosperous city. In addition to the productive fisheries, and alchemical ingredients and other marsh products, the city benefits tremendously from the nearby [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>). The Windcallers, who guide ships through the canal, are based here. Nevium is also where tax revenues from canal transits are collected, which provide significant wealth to the city, and support a large official Chardonian governmental presence.

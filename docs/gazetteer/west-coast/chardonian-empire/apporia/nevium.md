Nevium is a bustling port city and the provincial capital of Portalia, built on pilings above the salt marshes along the [Gulf of Chardon](<../../gulf-of-chardon.md>) coast, about 10 miles east of the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>). Completely destroyed in DR 1589 during the War of the Dark Rift, Nevium was rebuilt in early DR 1600s and grew quickly into a thriving port after the [Old Chardon Canal](<./old-chardon-canal.md>) was reopened under Chardonian control in DR 1619. 

The Windcallers, who guide ships through the canal, are based here. Nevium is also where tax revenues from canal transits are collected, which provide significant wealth to the city, and support a large official Chardonian governmental presence.

The Yeraad is a wide, winding river that flows from its source in the [Sentinels](<../../sentinel-range/sentinel-range.md>), through the southern parts of the [Elderwood](<../../chasa-nahadi-watershed/elderwood.md>), and across the lowlands to the Emerald Bay. Its name derives from the old Northos name, meaning Green River.

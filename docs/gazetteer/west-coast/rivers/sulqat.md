The Sulqat is a cold, rushing river, mostly unnavigable, that flows northeast from the ~Mawakel Border Mountains~ to the ~Great Bay~, past the city of Suhaya. The salmon runs on the Sulqat are a major source of food and income for the people of the [Mawar Confederacy](<../mawar-confederacy/mawar-confederacy.md>).

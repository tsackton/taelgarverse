The Gulf of Chardon is the name for the sheltered body of water formed by the ~Emerald Bay Peninsula~ to the west and south, and the mainland to the east. 

Relatively sheltered from major storms, it is a well-traveled maritime highway, with numerous sailing ships, fishing boats, and naval vessels passing to and from Chardon.

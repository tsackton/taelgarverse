The Gulf of Chardon is the name for the sheltered body of water formed by the [Apporia](<chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>) to the west and south, and the mainland to the east. 

Relatively sheltered from major storms, it is a well-traveled maritime highway, with numerous sailing ships, fishing boats, and naval vessels passing to and from [Chardon](<chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>).  It is also rich in marine life and is a highly productive fishing area.

## Overview

Largely untouched by the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), the lands of the south contains deserts, jungles, and mystery. 

## Boundaries

- To the north, this region is bordered by the northern edge of the ~Great Desert~.
- To the east, this region is bordered by the ~Eastern Ocean~.
- To the west, this region is bordered by the eastern edge of the [Sea of Storms](<../greater-dunmar/sea-of-storms.md>) and the hills and badlands that mark the eastern edge of the Istaros Watershed

Little is known about the southern reaches of this region.

## Major Features

- [Orekatu](<./orekatu.md>): *Lizardfolk jungle from Kenzo solo, described as analogous to something like Panama, generally tropical jungle of some kind.*

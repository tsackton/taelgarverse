The halfling ship Emerald Song is a fast, lanteen-rigged, three-masted trading ship owned by the Silversong clan, rigged with a single square mast and two fore-and-aft masts, at least typically. It typically sails between Chardon and points on the Nevos Sea with a crew of 22 and room for up to 12 passengers, more if they are halflings.

The ship is designed to run fast with relatively light, high value cargo, and optimized for all-season sailing with the ability to sail close into the wind, allowing flexible routing even during the monsoon. However, it is vulnerable to storms, so tends to hug the coast in the Endless Ocean, and does not trade north of Chardon. 

With a following wind and good conditions, can achieve speeds approaching 8 knots, meaning it can go nearly 200 miles a day if crewed to sail around the clock. More typically travels at an average speed of 4 mph, achieving about 100 miles per day.


## Layout
In addition to the hold and storage, the lower decks have a galley, mess, crew quarters. There are two larger cabins usually reserved for paying passengers and older halflings. Big folk have little choice but to sleep in hammocks on the top deck, which is the only one sized for big folk. Not super comfortable, and no privacy, but manageable.
## Crew

As is typical for halfling ships, the Emerald Song is crewed in large part by members of the extended family that owns the ship (the Silversongs, in this case).

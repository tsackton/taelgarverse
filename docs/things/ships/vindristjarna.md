## History

Eons ago, lost in the dawn of time when the Firstborn walked the earth and the great empires of giants and dragons and other creatures of myth and legend  stretched across the world, great skyships of the storm giants sailed the skies. While a few may remain in distant hidden corners of the world, or travel the skies of other planes, many crashed or were destroyed.

One such skyship, the Star on the Wind, Vindristjarna (vin-dree-shar-na), crashed on what is now the Dunmari plains thousands of years ago. 

The ancient skyships of the storm giants are powered by [Phasing Stones](<../magic-items/phasing-stones.md>), that connect to the dreamworld and allow one to imagine and project different physics, physics where stone can float. 

While the phasing stone that originally powered Vindristjarna is mostly destroyed, the ship is otherwise intact and could be made to fly with a new phasing stone. 

## Recovery and Repair

[Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) [restored Vindristjarna in the course of their adventures](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-74-dufr.md>), replacing the ruined phasing stone with a new one, [recovered from Hralgar's ancient mountain home](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-73-dufr.md>). 

Currently, the hull of the ship has been restored and repaired, and two stone decks constructed, creating three floors: a storage hold currently unimproved, a lower deck, and an upper deck. 

The upper deck, occupying a total of 12,000 square feet (480 squares), is dominated by a large central courtyard, greenhouse, and garden, maintained by Kenzo. Around the railing of the upper deck is also a depiction of the travels of [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), and especially the stories of the people they have met, recalling the [Hall of Stories](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/hall-of-stories.md>) in the [Monastery of Bhishma](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/monastery-of-bhishma.md>). 

Also constructed are a well-equipped galley and kitchen, a dining hall, a map room maintained by Wellby, a workshop and a games room maintained by Seeker and providing space for Faldrak to work, a sanctuary of the tanshi maintained by Delwath, and comfortable living quarters for ten hirelings or followers, as well as cabins for Riswynn, Delwath, Seeker, Kenzo, and Wellby, and a guest suite. 
### Facilities

These rooms function as [special facilities](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/ua/bastions-cantrips/BRF3GSu0nTfNu8p4/UA2023-BastionsCantrips.pdf?icid_source=house-ads&icid_medium=crosspromo&icid_campaign=playtest8), giving the following benefits: 
Delwath's tanshi shrine: Sanctuary
Kenzo's ki garden: Greenhouse
Wellby's map room: Library
Seeker's hall of games: Training Area
Garden: Garden
Kenzo's Wall of Stories: Trophy Room
Workshop: Workshop

Rules are [here](<../../campaigns/mechanics/bastion-rules.md>).

*You can have up to 25 special facilities, although you are a tiny bit constrained by space. The upper deck and lower deck are each 12,000 square feet (480 squares); the hold is 9,800 square feet (392 squares). I would assume that maybe 90% of that is usable for the bastion rules, so a total of maybe 1200 usable squares.*

### Followers and Traveling Companions

You have attracted a considerable retinue of followers on Vindristjarna, as well as some traveling companions. These include:

[Faldrak Bronzehammer](<../../people/dwarves/faldrak-bronzehammer.md>) (he/him). A dwarven an artificer, former adventurer, creator of magic items, and aspiring skyship captain. Runs the workshop when Seeker is not around, and wants to learn to drive the ship.

[Amil](<../../people/dunmari/amil.md>) (he/him). A joyful and upbeat Dunmari monk of the Order of the Awakened Soul, who trained with Pava and Avaras in the [Garamjala Desert](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/garamjala-plateau/garamjala-desert.md>) before leaving to help record the stories of the ordinary people of the world. Helps Kenzo with the Wall of Stories (Trophy room).

[Kethra Silverspark](<../../people/dwarves/kethra.md>) (unknown). A dwarven smith and adventurer, drawn in by stories of Riswynn's fame, who never really fit in Tharn Todor after being freed from Morkalan. 

[Nuzkar](<../../people/orcs/nuzkar.md>) and [Aygul](<../../people/orcs/aygul.md>), orcs and twin sisters. 

(not yet introduced)
[Égnir](<../../people/elves/egnir.md>) (he/him, AY-nyeer). A quiet and meditative young elven man, a gardener and a musician, seeking to experience the world in his own quiet way. Helps Kenzo and Delwath with the courtyard, gardens, and greenhouses. 

[Jotha](<../../people/deno-qai/jotha.md>) (she/her, yo-TAG). A Deno'qai warrior and Godcaller lost to the shadow realms, and now presumably wandering Taelgar somewhere. 

UNNAMED (unknown). Mapmaker

UNNAMED (unknown). A halfling storyteller. 

[Kecha](<../../people/kenku/kecha.md>) (unknown). A kenku scout. 
## Magic

In addition to the phasing stone, Vindristjarna is equipped with the following magic.
### Pitcher of Purity
A silver water pitcher, kept in the kitchens. Any non-magical liquid poured into the pitcher is purified, removing any poison or disease and turning the liquid into pure drinking water. [Recovered from the Edge of Echoes](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-86-dufr.md>). Drankorian make. 
### Cleansing Stone
A polished stone sphere, 1 foot in diameter, embedded on top of short marble pedestal. While touching the stone, you can use an action to activate it and remove dirt and grime from your garments and your person. Originally located in Eudomes' bedroom in the Stormcaller Tower; recovered upon the destruction of the tower by Hralgar when he was freed from imprisonment. Drankorian make. 
### Cold Chest
A 3 foot deep by 4 foot wide stone chest, [recovered](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-86-dufr.md>) from an ancient Drankorian workshop and laboratory hidden along an underground portion of the Freccila River in south-central Cymea, historically known as the Elemental Forge, and more recently as the Edge of Echoes. The chest is enchanted. Any food or drink that is placed within the chest will not spoil. Drankorian make. 
### Planar Prism
A fine hollow sphere made of wires of [Inkaye](<../materials/inkaye.md>), in which a shimmering crystal prism is mounted. This item is magically linked to the [phasing stone](<../magic-items/phasing-stones.md>) on [Vindristjarna](<./vindristjarna.md>): if you are attuned to the phasing stone, you are considered attuned to the rainbow prism, and vice versa. 

While attuned to the rainbow prism, you can use an action to separate resonant extraplanar energy via the spectral prism, creating a bridge of rainbow light and magical energy. This bridge can connect to one of the following locations:
- Using the inherent resonance of the plane of Taelgar, you can create a bridge to a point you can see. 
- If there are extraplanar resonances present when you activate the prism, you can separate and fracture them, creating a bridge to a location on the resonant plane, determined by the local extraplanar geography. For example, if you attempted to use the Planar Prism while near the weak point between the material plane and Arborea outside Tokra, you could connect the bridge to the closest location on Arborea.
- If you have an external source of extraplanar resonance, you can use that to tune and guide the prism, creating a bridge to a general location on that plane. You can attempt to guide the creation of the bridge to be near a landmark of interest, but cannot guarantee the endpoint of the bridge will be at a particular location on the other plane. 
- You can use the magical link between the Planar Prism and Vindristjarna's phasing stone to create a bridge that leads to Vindristjarna from any point, on Taelgar or on another plane. 

Stepping on to the bridge instantly transports a willing creature to the end point of the bridge, regardless of distance. A bridge, once created, lasts for 7 days, unless you dismiss it early as an action. 
  
Once you create a bridge, you cannot create another one until 7 days have passed, unless the distance between the two ends of the bridge is less than 100 miles, in which case you can create another bridge after the next dawn.

*Note: the intention is to allow some teleportation / plane shift hijinx, but not create a mechanism to, e.g., teleport an army (by opening a bridge, flying Vindristjarna elsewhere, then having thousands of people walk across the bridge). I haven't quite figured out the right mechanical way to limit, but want to be clear it won't work for these kinds of things.*


### Icicle Turret
*Note: you'll need to choose either this or the cloud generator, but as there is some discussion in the text thread I put cleaned up versions of both here.*

The icicle turret is a silver and stone turrent mounted on the front of the ship, permanently coated in frost and ice from the embedded shard of eternal ice. This item is magically linked to the [phasing stone](<../magic-items/phasing-stones.md>) on [Vindristjarna](<./vindristjarna.md>): if you are attuned to the phasing stone, you are considered attuned to the icicle turret, and vice versa.  

The icicle turret has four charges, and regains all expended charges each day at dawn. As an action, you can use one charge to create one of the following effects. 
- Sleet Storm: You summon a storm of sleet and ice from the turret, creating a storm of ice and sleet that occupies a 40 foot radius circle, and extends no more than 100 feet from the ship (so if Vindristjarna is within 100 feet of the ground, it reaches the ground, otherwise the storm peters out before reaching the ground). The area of the storm is heavily obscured, except to an individual attuned to Vindristjarna, and is difficult terrain. When a creature enters the storm for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.If a creature starts its turn in the storm area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.The storm lasts for 1 minute. The storm ends early if an effect ends your concentration on Vindristjarna. 
- Rain of Ice: You launch 8 sharp daggers of ice from the turret. For each dagger, choose a target you can see within 300 feet of the turret, and make a spell attack roll, doing 2d6 cold damage on a hit. 
- Icicle Shield: You encase the entire ship in a globe of solid ice. Each 10 foot segment of ice has an AC 12, 30 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage. The wall of ice crumbles if 10 segments are destroyed. Otherwise, it lasts for 1 hour.

## Mechanics

### Basic Control
After one full day of practice while attuned to the phasing stone, a person can acquire the skill to manipulate and control Vindristjarna. Flying the ship under basic control requires Concentration. It allows you to fly at speeds of up to 10 miles per hour, for up to 12 hours per day, and also allows you to perceive from any location on the surface of the ship. You can maintain altitude and position without requiring Concentration, however. 
### Advanced Control
After operating Vindristjarna for at least 6 weeks, you gain the ability to control the ship in a more advanced fashion. Under advanced control, you can maintain steady flight on a straight course indefinitely, without requiring concentration, and even while sleeping. Steering, delicate maneuvers such as landing, and perceiving from any location on the surface of the ship still require Concentration. In addition, once you have learned advanced control, you can share attunement. Up to three individuals with this level of training, and up to one additional individual with basic control, can be attuned to Vindristjarna at the same time. 
### Combat Control
While flying under advanced control, you can focus to enter a heightened state of control. This requires Concentration, but can be done as a free action at any time, and lasts for up to 10 minutes. Under this heightened state, you can fly Vindristjarna with a combat movement speed of 120 feet, you can perceive from any location on the ship, and any spells or magical abilities you use can originate from any point on the ship. Under combat control, damage cannot cause you to lose concentration on Vindristjarna. You can use combat control once, and regain all uses when you finish a long rest. If you attempt to use combat control when you have no uses remaining, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, gaining one level of exhaustion on a failure. 
### Losing Control
While attuned to Vindristjarna, the ship will not crash. However, if no one is attuned to the phasing stone,  the ship will begin to drift towards the ground at a speed of 10 feet per second. If the phasing stone is destroyed, or its connection to Vindristjarna severed, the ship will plummet from the sky and crash.

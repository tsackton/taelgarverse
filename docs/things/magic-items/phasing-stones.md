# Phasing Stones
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Giant](<../../species/children-of-the-riving/giants.md>) Magic Stone**  

Phasing stones are ancient fragments of magical energy that power the reality-twisting constructions of the giants. Each phasing stone is a unique construction, that embeds something of another plane into its very fabric, and allows the attuned user, with enough skill and practice, to manipulate that planar energy in a potent way. 


The Dunmar Fellowship posses a phasing stone that powers Vindristjarna: [Hralgar's Phasing Stone](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/notable-items/hralgar-s-phasing-stone.md>)

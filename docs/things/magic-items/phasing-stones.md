# Phasing Stones
>[!info]+ Information
> (magical stone)

Phasing stones are ancient fragments of magical energy that power the reality-twisting constructions of the giants. 

Once capable of reshaping the very fabric of the world, since [The Riving](<../../events/ancient/the-riving.md>) they have been reduced in effect. Nonetheless, an intact phasing stone is still capable of powering significant magical effects, such as skyships.

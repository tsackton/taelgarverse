# Tollen Magical Tattoo
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Tollender](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) Magic Tattoo**  

A variety of magical tattoos are produced by the artisans of [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>), using magical inks produced by the secrets of the [Dyer's Guild](<../../groups/tollen-guilds/dyer-s-guild.md>). 

The most common of these have simple effects: allowing the bearer to see in the dark, to subtly shift their appearance, to change the color and style of their clothes with illusions, or simply to animate and move on command. 

More elaborate designs, however, are possible with skill, time, and money.

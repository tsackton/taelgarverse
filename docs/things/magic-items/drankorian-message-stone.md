Drankorian message stones are typically polished stone, about the size of a halfling's fist, marked with arcane sigils. They were created in large numbers by Drankorian wizards to help manage the [Drankorian Empire](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>). Although possible to destroy with dedicated effort, many survived the fall of Drankor and can be scattered across the old territories of the empire. 

Each stone is paired at creation with one or more partner stones: when a stone is activated, words spoken into the activated stone can be heard from all partner stones. Drankorian message stones typically have one of three ranges: short range stones work over a range of about 50 miles; standard stones over a range of about 1000 miles; and long range stones can reach anywhere on the same plane of existence as their partner.

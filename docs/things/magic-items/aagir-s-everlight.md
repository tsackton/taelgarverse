# Aagir's Everlight
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Dunmari](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) Magic Wondrous Item**  

A small silver statue (about a big as a hand), of a spear point decorated in etched flames; the tip burns with a continual flame, seemingly not consuming fuel. These are a common Dunmari item used to provide light in temples. 

The flame that burns on these spear points never goes out and does not give off heat. In temples, they are typically covered when darkness is desired.

# Skaer Steel
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Skaer](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/realms/skaer.md>) Material**  

Skaer steel is a rare steel produced by secret means by the Skaer, using the heat of their volcanic islands and rare metals to create a material that is remarkably light and holds an edge exceptionally well.

A skilled smith can use Skaer steel to produce masterwork weapons, which are typically more accurate, more damaging, or both than normal weapons.

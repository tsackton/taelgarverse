# Chalyte
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **Magical Mineral**  

Chalyte is a rare mineral imbued with the essence of the [Plane of Magic](<../../cosmology/plane-of-magic.md>). Pure, refined chalyte is associated with a wide variety of magical properties. Tthe most common and well-understood use is to empower enspelled items and other enchantments, but rumors speak also of ways in which chalyte can be used to enhance the magic of spellcasters. 

Chalyte is extremely rare, however, and is almost never found in pure form, despite rumors of vast sources deep beneath the [Sentinels](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range.md>). Most commonly, it is mined as an impure ore. Under intense heat, the chalyte can be separated first into a pure, reactive powder, and then shaped crystals. The powder, though easier to make, is thought to be extremely dangerous: easy to use, but also easy to abuse and prone to causing magical backlashes. The crystal, though it requires complex arcane secrets closely guarded by the Chardonian refiners, is safer to use and less likely to explode or destroy the minds of those using it. 

Rumors speak of chalyte zombies, the empty husks of those who abuse chalyte, whose excessive use burned out their mental capacity, leaving only an empty shell of what was once a person. Although many will say this is rare, more commonly chalyte abuse leads to magical surges that can burn away the ability of the user to channel magic of any kind. 


In the DR 1680s, Chardonian explorers found chalyte in the mountains near Voltara, triggering a massive explosion of investment. Since then, the Chardonian Empire solidified its control over the [Northern Provinces](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/northern-provinces.md>), especially [Voltara](<../../gazetteer/northwest-coast/northern-provinces/voltara/voltara.md>), establishing a series of chalyte mines. This allowed chalyte to become central to the might and magic of the Chardonian Empire. Chalyte fuels the artificers and crafters of Chardon, whose elaborate enspelled enchantments command astronomical prices and bring riches to the city and the empire. Chalyte fuels the Windcallers, whose mastery over the ocean winds makes the Chardonian navy the most feared on the Endless Ocean. And chalyte is a critical component of magic of the war wizards of the Chardonian Legion, allowing them to perform feats far beyond their natural power.

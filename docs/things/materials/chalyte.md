A magical gemstone imbued with the essence of the [Plane of Magic](<../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/plane-of-magic.md>), often used to create magic items or empower spells. However, chalyte is dangerous to use, and excessive use often leads to negative consequences, including burning out all magical ability and even mental capacity, in extreme cases.

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Sold owned by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on August 9th, 1748 by [Albus](<../../people/chardonians/albus.md>), in [Darba](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/coastal-dunmar/darba/darba.md>), [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)  


This is a collection of poems and songs by a relatively little-known Drankorian era Elvish poet, [Nelawe](<../../people/elves/nelawe.md>). This book is chiefly notable in Elvish literary history as an early example of Elvish works departing from the tradition poetic and epic forms, playing with spacing and language in echo and response to the classics. Of particular note is her fascination with responding to and playing with themes of the forgotten past, which for elves often meant giants and the lore of the timeless days during the Age of Creation. 

The book is clearly well-read, and a few poems mentioning storm giants and their connection to dreams and prophecy seem to be particularly starred. 


Later it was discovered the a stanza from this book (reproduced below) was used by [Eudomes](<../../people/historical-figures/eudomes.md>) used as the key to unlock the [Binding Stones](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-stormcaller-tower/binding-stones.md>) that were binding [Hralgar](<../../people/giants/hralgar.md>)

>A Lament for Lost Thunder

>>Gone are the days of giants striding, thunder in hand, earth    (shaking
>>their roars through the ages, their fury, a memory) unchanging--
>>dreams of ancient lore, the skies ablaze with storms, their gaze
>>upon the distant cloud on which they soar, a force unbowed

# Luminastra's Gift
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Tollender](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>) Play**  

A popular comedic play written by [Thomas Hawke](<../../people/tollenders/thomas-hawke.md>), a playwright in [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/tollen/tollen.md>). The play tells the story of Geoffrey, a down-on-his-luck sailor shipwrecked by carelessness in a storm on the Green Sea, as Luminastra, a whale endowed with magic, who rescues him and takes him to a magical world beneath the ocean. Over the course of the play, Geoffrey encounters various strange wonders far beneath the ocean, and comes to earn a second chance. By the end, he is returned to the surface world a changed man. 

The inspiration for this play, according to [Thomas Hawke](<../../people/tollenders/thomas-hawke.md>), was in part the rumors and songs from [Apporia](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/apporia/apporia.md>) of a garden of magical jade beneath the oceans, tended by [merfolk](<../../species/unusual-species/merfolk.md>) who could grow names.

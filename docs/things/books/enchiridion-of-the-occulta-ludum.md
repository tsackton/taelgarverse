# The Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Drankorian](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) Magical Book**  

The Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum appears to be a blank handbook of the Occulta Ludum, a Drankorian secret society. These books radiate faint illusion magic, and were clearly produced using magical means. 


The [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) has recovered two of these books in their travels. One, they found in among the surviving books and papers in [Stormcaller Tower](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/stormcaller-tower.md>), presumably once owned by [Eudomes](<../../people/historical-figures/eudomes.md>). 

The second, they found at the [Elemental Forge](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/cymea/elemental-forge.md>), probably once owned by the unnamed Occulta Ludum mage who staffed that place in the days of the Drankorian Empire.

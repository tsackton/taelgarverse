A Drankorian book about the creation and destruction of realms in places like the Feywild and Shadowfell. No extant copies known, but several fragments on the Feywild are preserved as commentary on a famous Drankorian play ([A Fool's Fortune](<./a-fool-s-fortune.md>)) about a hapless merchant who ends up in the Feywild.

# The Journey of the Souls
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **Hkaran Book**  

A book written in a Hkaran dialect, similar to Drankorian, by an unknown author, dating from before the [Downfall](<../../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>).

It describes the journey of souls after death, from the material plane to the [Land of the Dead](<../../cosmology/land-of-the-dead.md>) to their final resting place, outlining the stages of the journey, as hypothesized by the spellcasters, theologians, and scholars of the day. 

It is say that from the moment a living being dies on the material plane, it only takes a minute, at most, for their soul to fade from the world, and for their light to dim as they pass through the [Plane of Souls](<../../cosmology/plane-of-souls.md>). This journey ends in a vast [Land of the Dead](<../../cosmology/land-of-the-dead.md>), a great river of souls, that the author calls the Lethonic Shores. Even those who have been raised from the dead find that the images and memories of this place fade quickly, the author says, but it is a place of waiting, a place where the gods and demons of the outer planes come to claim the souls promised them, and take them to the spiritual realms. 

The author speculates on the metaphysics of the choice of the gods, and how souls are claimed, for some time, without any firm conclusions.

A seemingly empty book. Found by a Dunmari citizen of [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>). This man often scavenged for sellable loot in the desert. He had found three books some time ago, two filled with strange writing and one blank, and had sold the ones with writing to [Servius](<../../people/chardonians/servius.md>), a Chardonian who worked for some library in [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>). He found them on an [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), an ancient individual, with wrinkled skin, dried out almost like leather, who carried nothing but a ripped pouch and these three books. 

However when [Seeker](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) explores it, he is able to coax meaning from the pages. Studying this book has been a source of inspiration and new magic for [Seeker](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/seeker.md>) over the past several months. 

"As you open the book, the pages do initially seem blank. But as you touch them, faint lines in a gray ink start to appear, slowly at first and then faster and faster until there is a cacophony of information bombarding your senses, layers upon layers of runes.

Concentrating, you can start to pull out bits of information from the noise.

This book seems to be about the theory of runes and how each piece of a runic incantation combines in a specific way to shape extraplanar energy itself. As you delve deeper, you begin to glimpse a little of how runic magic actually works, instead of just following the rituals to channel energy. The essence line, the heart of each rune, draws in a specific kind of extraplanar energy. The pattern line, building off the essence line, shapes it and directs the energy. Amplification, augmentation and elaboration lines further control the power and effect of the rune. There is still much you cannot understand, as this is way more than you can take in at once -- why some runes only need to be spoken aloud to channel power, but others need physicality, or why it is easy to amplify some runes but not others. Much deeper study will be needed to fully grasp the depths of what is described here.

While you only scratched the surface of this tome, there is much still to be learned from your brief study. You begin to see how you can add elaboration lines to your runes of inspiration, adding more power and depth to those runes. You learn from the book a few new complex runic incantations."

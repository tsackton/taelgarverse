# The Cloak of Rainbows

- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Unique Magical Cloak__  
   Created DR 917 (832 years ago)  
   Created by Cloudspinner, in [Amberglow](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/amberglow.md>), the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>)  
   Owned by [Chief Lubash](<../../people/orcs/lubash.md>)

The Cloak of Rainbows is a multi-colored shimmering cloak, made of the threads of sunset woven by the Cloudspinner, and enchanted with powerful magic to shield the wearer from the sight and power of the Divine. 

[Cintra](<../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>) believed [Agata](<../../people/fey/agata.md>) was searching for it, and had heard it was supposedly created by Apollyon, but the truth is more complicated. The history of the Cloak of Rainbows is intimately connected with the history of the People of the Rainbow. It was originally a gift to allow these orcs to live free of [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s gaze. It was stolen by Apollyon, and then lost, and [rediscovered](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/letters-notes-and-tales/letter-from-govir.md>) by the Dunmari in the years before the Great War, only to be lost again during the Great War. 

Now, it is worn by the chiefs of Xurkhaz, currently Chief [Lubash](<../../people/orcs/lubash.md>). 

The power of the cloak has allowed, with hard work over the years, the People of the Rainbow to construct a magical barrier around Xurkhaz, a barrier that prevents [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>) from acting, seeing, or in any way influencing events in Xurkhaz. Not only does this keep the orcs of Xurkhaz safe from Thark's spying, it means that chained orcs, as they call the orcs still ensnared by Thark's magic, will not willingly enter Xurkhaz. 

The cloak also has the power to silence divine magic in a wide radius, should the wearer wish it.

The Cloak of Rainbows is a multi-colored shimmering cloak, made of the threads of sunset woven by the Cloudspinner, and enchanted with powerful magic to shield the wearer from the sight and power of the Divine. 

[Cintra](<../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>) believed [Agata](<../../people/fey/agata.md>) was searching for it, and had heard it was supposedly created by [Apollyon](<../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), but the truth is more complicated. The history of the Cloak of Rainbows is intimately connected with the history of the [People of the Rainbow](<../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>). It was originally a gift to allow these orcs to live free of [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s gaze. It was stolen by [Apollyon](<../../people/historical-figures/drankorian-emperors/apollyon.md>), and then lost, and [rediscovered](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/letters-and-notes/letter-from-govir.md>) by the Dunmari in the years before the Great War, only to be lost again during the Great War. 

Now, it is worn by the chiefs of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), currently Chief [Lubash](<../../people/orcs/lubash.md>). 

The power of the cloak has allowed, with hard work over the years, the [People of the Rainbow](<../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) to construct a magical barrier around [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), a barrier that prevents [Thark](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>) from acting, seeing, or in any way influencing events in [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>). Not only does this keep the orcs of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) safe from Thark's spying, it means that chained orcs, as they call the orcs still ensnared by Thark's magic, will not willingly enter [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>). 

The cloak also has the power to silence divine magic in a wide radius, should the wearer wish it.

# The Heart of Shakun
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Unique Wonderous Item__  
   Owned by [Cintra](<../../people/dunmari/cintra.md>)  
</div>


A rough hewn ochre stone heart, a focus for [Shakun](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>)'s power in the mortal realm. 

Allows the maintenance of the web of illusions that protects [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>)'s eastern border from enemies. 

Must remain in the [Red Mesa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/red-mesa.md>), the physical embodiment of [Shakun](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>) in this world, in order to function as the heartbeat of the [Shakun Mystai](<../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/shakun-mystai.md>) and allow Dunmari's protections to be maintained.

![Dreamweaver Staff](../../assets/dreamweaver-staff.jpg){align="right"; width="300"}The Dreamweaver Staff is a carved wooden staff with an intricate pattern of swirling shapes. It has been carried by the Speaker of the [Shakun Mystai](<../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/shakun-mystai.md>) for many generations, and is said to be able to allow the bearer to manipulate dreams. It is even possible, supposedly, to transport subjects into the [Dreamworld](<../../cosmology/dreamworld.md>) with this staff. 


Currently, this staff is carried by [Candrosa](<../../people/dunmari/candrosa.md>), and was used by Candrosa after the return of the [Heart of Shakun](<./heart-of-shakun.md>) to send the members of the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) on journeys to the [Dreamworld](<../../cosmology/dreamworld.md>)

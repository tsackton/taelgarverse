:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Current location: [Tharn Todor](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/tharn-todor.md>), [Nardith](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/nardith.md>), the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/yuvanti-mountains.md>)


![Chalice of the Runepriest](../../assets/chalice-of-the-runepriest.png){align="right"; width="400"}A elaborate rune-carved chalice of ambiguous origin, revered as a sacred national treasure by the dwarves of Nardith. It is rumored to have many powers, including the power to heal all wounds and illness and the power to magically provide food, water, and shelter to all who need it. 

It was found when the [Dwarves](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) fleeing the destruction of the kingdom of [Ardith](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>) at the end of the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>) reached the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/yuvanti-mountains.md>), located in a chamber already carved and prepared deep beneath the ground, reminiscent of [Heart of the Mountain](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>). When it was first found, it flowed with salt water (some say, the tears of the [Bahrazel](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>); others a memory of the ocean that once covered the land). This became the site where [Tharn Todor](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/tharn-todor.md>) was constructed. 

## History of the Chalice
- 1547 DR: The Chalice of the Runepriest is discovered by dwarven refugees from [Ardith](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>), while exploring the newly risen Yuvanti Mountains. 
- Mar 1575 DR: The Chalice of the Runepriest is carried north by an expedition under the leadership of Hagrim Firebrand to search for survivors among the ruins of [Ardith](<../../gazetteer/sentinel-range/dwarven-kingdoms/ardith.md>). 
- May 1575 DR: The Chalice provides protection and healing for soldiers and refugees alike, and many hundreds of dwarves are rescued.

The chalice is abandoned in the fortifications surrounded the Statue of the Stoneborn Warrior. 
- Dec 05, 1747 DR A group of Chardonian treasure hunters arrives at the ancient Statue of the Stoneborn Warrior and finds a major cache of Dwarven relics hidden nearby, including the Chalice of the Runepriest.

# Lizardfolk

>[!quote] Lizardfolk saying, author unknown
>At misty daybreak
_a quiet emerald swamp dreams_  
_of the setting sun_  

The quiet flash of fireflies on a summer night, the dawn song of nesting warblers, the midday croak of the bullfrog -- these speak of home to the Lizardfolk. At home between the water and the land, Lizardfolk communities tend to grow up in wild places near water, often swamps and wetlands, where they live a peaceful life of contemplation and repose. When they venture out into the world, they have a striking and often menacing appearance, but despite their reptilian looks, Lizardfolk are compassionate friends and dedicated members of their communities, of any race.

### Menacing Exteriors, Peaceful Minds

Lizardfolk stand an average of six feet tall with a slightly forward crouching stance, to balance a three foot long tail. They are finely scaled and have a perpetual glistening appearance, highlighting there frightening reptilian visage. If the sun catches a lizardfolk just as emerging from the water into early morning swamp mist, the arrangement of scales along their spine creates a prism effect, scattering tiny rainbows. Infants are born a translucent pale blue, with gills that disappear as limbs sprout and the scales grow over the course of a few weeks. Youths are a vibrant blue green, often with streaks of a greenish brown, or, very rarely, brilliant blue marks about the face.

For the large part of their lives, though, most Lizardfolk are a variety of greens and browns. Extremely aged Lizardfolk, especially the elders, develop a uniformly light blue or light blue green coloration and don't glisten as though wet, though in moments of insight, they seem to sparkle a bit and, on very rare occasions, seem ever so slightly transparent to direct sunlight.

Lizardfolk feel a deep connection to the natural world, the elements and cycles of life, and the seasons. While they are not pacifists, they will rarely provoke fights or lose control of their tempers in a violent way. They believe very strongly in the circular nature of life, and feel that unjust deeds will be met in turn, giving them a strong sense of fairness and honor. They also believe in the preciousness of life, despite their long life spans, and see hurt, pain, and suffering as necessary evils at best. Many Lizardfolk find their calling as healers in the lands of other races. Most Lizardfolk also see themselves as protectors of their homelands; while this may necessitate violence, Lizardfolk generally strive not to become comfortable with a life of killing and destruction.

Lizardfolk reach adulthood in their early 20s; the first 5-8 years of their life are spent as amphibious young. Most live into their second century, but few live much beyond 200 years.
### Devotion to Kin and Home

Lizardfolk have a strong bond with their close family, and if anything an even stronger bond with the swamps, forests, and other areas they call home. They live in small communities hidden in swamps and wet forests, usually led by a elder matriarch. They believe their ancestors’ spirits echo in the living things of their home, and even Lizardfolk who have traveled far from home will make pilgrimages to return and reconnect. Lizardfolk will also return to their homeland as they approach death; Lizardfolk who die far from home often become restless spirits until they can be given a proper burial with their ancestors. Lizardfolk see themselves as the caretakers of their land, and live in a way that preserves the wild beauty they love. They are resourceful in how they nourish themselves from the land, leaving little trace of their presence beyond their small villages and dwellings.

Lizardfolk tend towards patience and empathy, which gives them a friendly outlook on most other races. They have a special affinity for humans and halflings, and Lizardfolk who leave their homes will often be found traveling in the company of Halflings or living in Human cities.

Lizardfolk find the aloofness of the Elves, the tradition-bound rigid society of the Dwarves, and the chaotic nature of the Kenku hard to understand, but they strive to empathize with all living things.

Through their land, Lizardfolk also maintain connections to the spirits of their ancestors, who are protected and guided by the Firstborn deities, the  Tharzen Anzinakoa, the Eldest of Elders. They venerate with prayers and rituals four aspects of the Tharzen Anzinakoa, one for each season: Negu (winter), Udazkena (autumn), Bero (summer), and Hazkunde (spring). They see the Tharzen Anzinakoa as the bridge between themselves and the Divine, as guardian spirits, as protectors of their homelands. They believe the Tharzen Anzinakoa gather to them the spirits of Lizardfolk after they die, and create new souls from these ancestral spirits whenever a new Lizardfolk is born, and thus the cycle of birth and death is completed.

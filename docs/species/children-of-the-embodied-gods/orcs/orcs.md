# Orcs

>[!quote] The Blood Binding, excerpt
*Thark, Master of Unbreakable Chains, in your fire we temper this soul. Bind it to your will, so it may never know peace, only the insatiable hunger for strife and turmoil.*

Scattered across the world of Taelgar small orc bands roam, raiding and pillaging in the name of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>), the god of war without end. Although most orcs live in small groups, but when a leader blessed by [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>) arises, they can bind many orcs together into a fearsome battle horde. 
## Imposing and Violent
Orcs are robust and imposing figures, often standing over 6 feet tall, usually with tusks protruding from their lower lips. Their skin tones range from shades of green to a dull gray, typically with black or red eyes. Most orcs die in battle, but those who manage to survive or who escape [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s chains have lifespans similar to humans, although they mature much quicker than humans. 

Orcs are a decentralized and often chaotic race, driven to violence and conflict by their patron deity, [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>). Because of this, orcs have a fearsome reputation, and free orcs who have escaped [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s chains often struggle to distinguish themselves from their [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)-cursed breathren.
## Families and Hordes
Orc communities are generally small. They lack centralized governance, and a group of orcs often extend no further than a large family group. Compelled to violence by [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>), these orc groups frequently fight each other, although they raid settled areas when they can. This constant war, even with high birth rates, usually keeps orc population sizes fairly low. 

However, sometimes a leader blessed by [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>) will unite many small groups together, forming a horde that can number in the hundreds or thousands. These hordes always form under the influence of a strong leader who can turn the violence of individual orcs to external purposes, and usually take on the name of the leader as their identity. These large hordes will often emerge out of marginal lands unexpectedly, threatening the cities and kingdoms of other races. 
## Thark, the God of War Without End
Orcs are tightly bound to, and cursed by, [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>), the embodied god of war without end. Through [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s dominion, orcs are compelled to violence without purpose, war for the sake of war. 

Orcish religion, the manifestation of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s will in the world, glorifies strength and resolving conflicts through violence. But the real power of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s curse is enforced by a mysterious rumored ritual known by many names, and often referred to as the Blood Oath of the Crimson Blade by human scholars. While few details of this ritual are known to non-orcs, it is rumored that this ritual, performed on all newborn orcs, infuses them with the strength and fire of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s will. Those who cannot or will not accept the curse of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>) do not survive the ritual. 


## Unchained Orcs
Rumors circulate throughout Taelgar of unchained orcs, free orcs that have broken the bounds of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s curse, and live without the burning fire of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s divine will driving them to ceaseless violence.

The most famous of these orcs are the [People of the Rainbow](<../../../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>), living in the deserts east of [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>). 

Free orcs live in the constant shadow of [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s hunters. [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>) watches over his orcs, driving them to fight each other, bringing strength to the victors. But none are more hated by [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s orcs than those who have broken free: any tribe that tries to turn from [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s way is quickly subject to unceasing attacks until they are defeated and subjugated, unless they can find a way to hide from [Thark](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/thark.md>)'s probing eyes.

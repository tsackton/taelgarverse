# Elven Cycle of Generations

The elven cycle of generations, know as the *ka*, is the result of elves very long lifespan, but limited time when they can bear children. Elves are only fertile for about 30 years, when the roots of Aldanor tie them to the [Material Plane](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/material-plane.md>), but can live to be hundreds, or even thousands, of years old. This means that each generation is distinct and non-overlapping, and the elves count these, numbering from when the planes were separated and the Taelgar was created. 
## *Mela and Leya*

Each new *ka* begins with the *mela*, when the the Living Tree, [Aldanor](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/aldanor.md>), puts roots into the material world. All elves feel the pull of this connection to Taelgar, as it grows over the first few years of the *mela*. An elf experiencing their first *mela* feels a particularly strong pull towards Aldanor, and those who accept this connection are able to bear children, until the *mela* ends. Elven children are born only during the *mela*, and as it ends they enter the Dreaming, the 50 year childhood of dreams and magic during which elves sleep for the only time in their lives. 

The Dreaming ends with the Rite of Awakening, which marks the beginning of the *leya*, the time when [Elmerca](<../../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/elmerca.md>), the Wild Star, is dominant, and elves feel a pull to disperse, to journey. Children are considered adults when the experience their first Awakening, and those new adults are encouraged to travel, until the *mela* and the Rite of Return pulls them back, and the cycle repeats. 
## Aging and Leaving

The pull of the *mela* gets fainter and fainter as elves age. Elves in their first *mela* feel the pull most strongly, and many become parents. In their second, and third mela, many elves take on roles as nurturers of children and elven society, or caretakers of the world. By their fourth *mela*, some elves begin to stop feeling the roots of Aldanor, the pull of Taelgar, and many begin to forget the past, or even pass on entirely. Elves of this age and older are considered elders. By their fifth *mela*, many elves being to depart, and only those who have a strong reason to stay connected to the world remain for their 6th *mela* and beyond to become ancients. 


## The Years of the *ka*

Elves do not usually concern themselves with the passing of mere years, focusing instead on the cycle of *ka*, *mela*, and *leya*. Still, for those who must translate the elves into the history of other species, the dates of each *ka* in the Dwarven Count of Years (CY) and in Drankorian Reckoning (DR) are provided.

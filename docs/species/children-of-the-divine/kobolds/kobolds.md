# Kobolds

This page contains lore information about kobodls. For details on character creation and playing a kobold, see [Playing a Kobold](<../../../campaigns/mechanics/species/playing-a-kobold.md>). 

Kobolds in Taelgar are the children of great dragons of an age long past, created originally to be the servants, spies, and messengers of dragons. When the world was young, and the power of magic strong, they lived in the shadow of their creators and masters. Now, they live across the world, often in caves and tunnels. Renowned for their craftiness and trickery, some kobolds prey on other species, luring them into devious ambushes. Others worship their draconic creatures as gods, hoping to return to their rightful place at the side of the great wyrms of old. Still others forge their own way in the world, seeking their own path.

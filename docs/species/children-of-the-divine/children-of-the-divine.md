# Children of the Divine

In the early days of myth and wonder, the Creator Gods made the great wyrms, the archfey, the elder elementals, and the titans. From these immensely powerful beings, the [Dragons](<./dragons.md>), [Fey](<fey/fey.md>), [Elementals](<./elementals.md>), and [Giants](<./giants.md>) trace their ancestry. 

Since the long pause when the planes of existence were fully separated from the material plane, the [Fey](<fey/fey.md>) have mostly made their home in the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>) and the [Shadowfell](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/shadowfell.md>), while the [Elementals](<./elementals.md>) make their home in the [Elemental Realms](<../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-realms.md>). The [Giants](<./giants.md>) and [Dragons](<./dragons.md>) still linger on Taelgar, although whether they also have established strongholds on other planes is the subject of much debate and speculation.

# Giants

The giants of old were great crafters and creators, masters of weaving magic and reality together to create items of great power. Vast skyships sailed above the land, held aloft by the runes of giantkind, and great forges and metalworks produced artifacts of unparalleled beauty and power. 

Although much reduced in power since the days of myth and legend, giants still maintain the customs and traditions of the ancient days.

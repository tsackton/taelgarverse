# Efreeti

Efreeti are among the most powerful denizens of the [Elemental Plane of Fire](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-plane-of-fire/elemental-plane-of-fire.md>), ruling the great cities of fire with an iron fist. While sometimes noted for their cruelty, they do greatly value those who possess rare talents, and often will seek out renowned talents for their courts.

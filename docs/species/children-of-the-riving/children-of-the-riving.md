# Children of the Riving

In the early days of myth and wonder, before the multiverse was fixed in form, great beings of magical energy endlessly shaped and reshaped the land. When the [Divine Presence](<../../cosmology/gods/high-gods/divine-presence.md>) sundered the planes, the echoes of the Riving rippled across the Multiverse, creating the Children of the Riving. 

Whether these are the forms of great wyrms and titans that strode across the lands of magic in days of myth frozen and altered by the Riving or the dreams of magical beings or even of magic itself, or something stranger, none can say. 

Nonetheless, the [Dragons](<./dragons.md>), [Fey](<fey/fey.md>), [Elementals](<elementals/elementals.md>), and [Giants](<./giants.md>) trace their ancestry in some form or another to the great magical powers of the Age of Myth. 

Since the long pause when the planes of existence were fully separated from the material plane, the [Fey](<fey/fey.md>) have mostly made their home in the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), while the [Elementals](<elementals/elementals.md>) make their home in the [Elemental Realms](<../../cosmology/multiverse/energy-realms/elemental-realms/elemental-realms.md>). The [Giants](<./giants.md>) and [Dragons](<./dragons.md>) apparently still linger on Taelgar, although whether they also have established strongholds on other planes is the subject of much debate and speculation.

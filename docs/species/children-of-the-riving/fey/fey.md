# Fey

This page contains lore information about fey. For details on character creation and playing a fey character, see [Playing a Fey Species](<../../../campaigns/mechanics/species/playing-a-fey-species.md>). 

The fey are the natives of the [Feywild](<../../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), the creations and children of the powerful Archfey who ruled when the world was young, in the days of myth and legend. The people of the feywild are generally referred to as the "fey" or the "faerie", but there are distinctions, both obvious and subtle, among these folk. The fey can be mischievous, thriving on a clever trick, and even malevolent, seeking to profit from misery and finding pleasure in the suffering of others. They can also be noble, thriving on the majesty of creation and taking joy from the vast beauty of their home. 

- The most common folk among the fey, are a folk generally human-like in appearance, but possessing an otherworldly elegance and an ethereal quality. These folk, usually simply referred to as the "fey", could often pass as humans in the right circumstances, although their unusual eyes often give them away. A rare few of these folk are capable of changing their appearance and form at will, and are referred to as changelings. 
- The sometimes mischievous, sometimes helpful, and always magical flying fairies are also common among the people of the Feywild. These folk are usually small, and include creatures like the pixies, sprites, brownies, and other fairies.
- The original archfey, at the dawn of the multiverse, were responsible for the awakening of many animals. Some of these now inhabit the Feywild as beastfolk of various kinds. Most famous and most common are the horned satyrs, but whether other beastfolk may lurk in the corners of the Feywild is not recorded by human scholars. 
- Throughout the feywild, there are also innumerable dryads, nymphs, and other spirits of the land. These fey are typically strongly tied to a particular place, rarely traveling. 
- [Hags](<../../../primary-sources/story-about-hags.md>) are also fey, and often powerful ones, though many leave the Feywild to find easier prey for their schemes in the material plane. 

The centaurs, although creations of the archfey, are not counted among the inhabitants of the Feywild, as centaurs have, in general, turned their backs on their fey forbearers and live now as the protectors and guardians of Taelgar. 

The archfey and fey lords that rule the domains of the feywild generally owe their allegiance to either the Seelie Court or the Unseelie Court. While crudely considered "good" and "evil" fey by the ignorant, the real differences between them are subtler and more complicated, with the Seelie Court generally associated with protocol and the trappings of civilization, and the Unseelie Court generally associated with indulgence of primal instincts and a much more chaotic vibe. There are also independent archfey that shun the conflict of the Seelie and Unseelie courts and hold themselves neutral. 

All fey honor bargains, and the feywild runs on gifts and promises. But whether these are offered genuinely, or in an attempt to deceive, can be difficult for mortal minds to decipher. And the risk of accepting a bargain you do not understand may well be servitude in an archfey's court.

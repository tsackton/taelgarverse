# Unusual Species

Not every sentient species in Taelgar has a simple origin story. 

In ages past, cracks in the fabric of reality allowed alien creatures from the Far Realm to slip into the world, with unfathomable goals and strange minds. The most famous of these Creatures of the Far Realms are the [Ithilids](<./ithilids.md>), the mind flayers, who live deep underground and occasionally emerge to threaten the surface dwellers, always in search of brains to consume and sentient beings to enslave. 

Around the shores of the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), occasional rumors can be heard of Gnomes, the surface-dwelling cousins of dwarves, tinkerers and traders, though few will confirm to having seen one in person. 

The flying Kenku of the north rarely speak of their history or origins to outsiders, but can often be seen soaring over the cities on the shores of the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>). 

Many sailors claim to have seen the aquatic [Merfolk](<./merfolk.md>), or their semi-aquatic cousins who dwell in swamps and rivers. But reliable reports are difficult to come by. 

All of these species -- and others, not yet described -- share an unusual history, with origin stories that may not match the typical creation myths of other sentient beings on Taelgar.

# Grimlocks



Twisted [Humans](<../humans.md>), created by [Ithilids](<./ithilids.md>) as a slave race. Blind. Some lived with [Inakara](<../../people/other-nonhumans/inakara.md>) and her [Derro](<./derro.md>) band in the [dwarven outpost](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dwarven-outpost-raven-s-hold.md>) near [Raven's Hold](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/raven-s-hold.md>) until they were slain by dwarven mission there.

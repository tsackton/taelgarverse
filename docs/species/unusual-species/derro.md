# Derro



Twisted dwarves, the results of [mind flayer](<./ithilids.md>) experiments to create slave races. Severed from any connection to their firstborn and manipulated by mind flayers into their current form.

A small group of them lived in the [dwarven outpost near Raven's Hold](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/dwarven-outpost-raven-s-hold.md>), but have recently been killed by a dwarven mission there.

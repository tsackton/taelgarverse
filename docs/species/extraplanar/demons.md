# Demons

Demons are the personification of the violent, chaotic evil, engines of rage and destruction made flesh. The presence of demons in the material world spreads Abyssal corruption, from which more demons emerge. Demons consume the souls of those they claim, growing stronger from the violent energy of this act. 

The great demon lords of the Abyss seek nothing more than to grow in power.

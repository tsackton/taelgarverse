# Elementals





Elementals are creatures of raw elemental energy, natives of the Elemental Realms, ranging in power from minor elementals like mephits, to the proud and noble djinni, to the unfathomable power of leviathans. 


The [Djinn](<./elementals.md>), the most famous native creatures on the Plane of Air, need no introduction. Blue-skinned, tall, and muscular humanoids, whose lower legs seem to seamlessly merge with billowing mists, djinni feature prominently in the stories and lore collected in On Elemental Forms, and in many other tales and legends. Variously described as mischievous, honorable, and as changeable as the winds, djinni, legends say, can grant great boons or rain storms and destruction down on those who displease them.

# Devils

Devils are the personification of tyranny, of endless domination and power. Devils seek to tempt mortal souls to power, granting them strength in life in exchange for eternal servitude in death. 

The archdevils of the Nine Hells exist in a rigid hierarchy of power and influence, where the possession of armies of servants in the form of mortal souls is the surest way to gain strength and position.

# Gidari

The Gidari are strange creatures, rarely encountered by mortals, but frequently described by those who return from death. 

They are the guardians of the [Land of the Dead](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/proximate-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>), the neutral ground where the souls of dead mortals await their fate, and the shepherds of the newly deceased as they traverse the [Land of the Dead](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/proximate-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>) to their ultimate fate. 

Giradi are the guardians, protectors, and guides of souls while they traverse the Land of the Death. They make sure that these souls reach their destination beyond the veil, and they prevent interference with the journey of souls. While Gidari take no sides in the conflicts over mortal souls, they are implacable enemies of those would violate the sanctity of dead souls.

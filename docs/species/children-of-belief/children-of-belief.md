# Children of Belief

The Children of Belief are the native inhabitants of the Spiritual Realms, created by the prayers, curses, hopes, and fears of humanity in the early days of creation. 

Fiends, including [Devils](<./devils.md>) and [Demons](<./demons.md>), spring from the worst impulses of humanity, and inhabit the Nine Hells and the [Abyss](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/primal-realms/abyss.md>). 

[Celestials](<./celestials.md>) spring from the hopes and best wishes of humanity, and inhabit the divine realms of the incorporeal gods, such as Arkaash of the Dunmari pantheon.

The [Gidari](<./gidari.md>) are the guardians of the [Land of the Dead](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/proximate-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>), the guides that protect the souls of the recently deceased as they await their ultimate fate.

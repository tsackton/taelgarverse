# Species in Taelgar

The world of Taelgar is populated by many sentient species. All sentient species in Taelgar were created, in some way, by magic, usually by the direct intervention of a deity.  

The first sentient beings on Taelgar were the [Children of the Divine](<children-of-the-divine/children-of-the-divine.md>). The [Divine Presence](<../cosmology/gods/high-gods/divine-presence.md>) created the [Dragons](<children-of-the-divine/dragons.md>), [Fey](<children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>), [Elementals](<children-of-the-divine/elementals.md>), and [Giants](<children-of-the-divine/giants.md>) in the mythic age before even the Elder Folk walked the earth. Imbued with powerful magic, these creatures dominated the world in the early days of creation, when magic was strong and the various planes of existence still intertwined with the material plane. 

While many of the descendants of these powerful beings now dwell outside the [Material Plane](<../cosmology/multiverse/material-plane.md>), there are exceptions. [Dragons](<children-of-the-divine/dragons.md>), [Elementals](<children-of-the-divine/elementals.md>), and [Giants](<children-of-the-divine/giants.md>) feature regularly in tales of adventure; while most common folk have never personally encountered these powerful creatures, they are the heroes and villains of many tales. The [Centaurs](<children-of-the-divine/centaurs/centaurs.md>), descended from the first [Fey](<children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>), claimed Taelgar as their home long ago, and are now rarely found in the [Feywild](<../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>). Many other [Fey](<children-of-the-divine/fey/fey.md>), though not native to the material plane, are frequent visitors to Taelgar. And the diminutive trickster [Kobolds](<children-of-the-divine/kobolds/kobolds.md>), created by powerful dragons in days long past, can still be found in various corners of the world. 

The Divine Beings also created the Embodied Gods, who were shaped from divine energy, given physical form, permanence and consciousness, and the power to create. These Firstborn created the Elder Folk in their image, who draw power and magic from the mystical connection they share with their creator gods. They are the [Elves](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>), [Dwarves](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>), [Stoneborn](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/stoneborn/stoneborn.md>), [Lizardfolk](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>), and [Halflings](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/halflings/halflings.md>)

Some Embodied Gods were not created by the Divine Beings, but instead came into existence through the corruption of the Undivine, the Void Mind, a malevolent force dedicated to emptiness, the undoing of creation itself. These evil gods are responsible for the [Orcs](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>), the curse of lycanthropy, and Undead, as well as many monstrosities that roam the land. The Goblinoids are also the creations of the Undivine, made as servants of the forces that seek to undo creation. 

The [Humans](<humans/humans.md>), the most numerous sentient species on Taelgar, were created by the Divine Beings themselves, and gifted the divine spark. Through the prayers, curses, hopes, and fears of humanity, the Incorporeal Gods and the [Children of Belief](<children-of-belief/children-of-belief.md>), the fiends, celestials, and other creatures of divine realms, were imagined into being.

Scattered across Taelgar are also more unusual species, with diverse and strange histories. These includes the Gnomes, rumored to be distant relatives of the dwarves; the flying Kenku who live in secretive homes in the north and do not share their creation story with outsiders; and the various aquatic and semi-aquatic Merfolk who inhabit the oceans, swamps, and rivers of Taelgar, rarely interacting with the surface worlds; and the [Creatures of the Far Realms](<unusual-species/creatures-of-the-far-realms/creatures-of-the-far-realms.md>), with alien goals and strange powers. 

What other sentient beings may live in the far corners of the world, deep underground or across the oceans, remains a mystery.

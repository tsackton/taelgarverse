##  Plane-touched Traits



Basic idea is to select either:
(a) Aasimar, from PHB 2024
(b) Tiefling, from PHB 2024
(c) a home-brew updated / unified elemental

Elemental would be a standard 1/3/5, with cantrip + minor boon at 1st, 1st level spell at 3, 2nd level spell at 5th. This is pretty similar to the existing Genasi:

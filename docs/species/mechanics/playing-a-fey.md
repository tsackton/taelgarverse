{title: Playing a Fey}
---
Currently very much notes, and thinking about how to organize. 

Lore-wise, I think fey are mostly just fey. Certainly the beastfolk, the fae, and the fairies are not seen as truly different things in the Feywild. Possibly changelings and satyrs might deserve different consideration, or maybe fairies? 

All fey species should share at least:
Creature Type: Fey
Languages: 4 + Sylvan

Probably they all should have Darkvision given the Feywild's weird light patterns?
Probably all could have fey ancestry (advantage against charm)

A number of species could be used here:

https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/1026399-satyr

Honestly probably won't homebrew these unless someone wants to play them.



Fey in Taelgar are natives of the Feywild, a realm of whimsy and terror, magic and mystery. The fey are a diverse folk who come in many forms. They can be mischievous, thriving on a clever trick, and even malevolent, seeking to profit from misery and finding pleasure in the suffering of others. They can also be noble, thriving on the majesty of creation and taking joy from the vast beauty of their home. Many fey are many things at once. 

To create your fey character, first consider what kind of fey you wish to play. Then, consider why you are in Taelgar. Were you born here, perhaps to traveling parents? Did you leave your Feywild home due to danger, or curiosity, or on a quest? If you have a homeland in the Feywild, consider whether this is an important part of your character's story. If so, work with your DM to figure out a Fey realm that you came from. However, these details do not need to matter if you don't wish them to. 
# Types of Fey

## "The Fey"
The most common fey folk are simply known as the Fey. They are generally human-like in appearance, although one that is often touched with ethereal glamor. While these folk are not common on Taelgar, they are not unheard of, and many even manage to pass unnoticed among the mortals of the material plane. 

To represent these fey mechanically, you may choose to use the [Hogoblin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/motm/fantastical-races-continued#Hobgoblin) or [Eladrin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/motm/fantastical-races#Eladrin) traits, or the [Changeling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/motm/fantastical-races#Changeling) traits if you wish to play one of the changeling fey. 

## Fairies
The fairies are the small, diminutive folk of the Feywild, cousins to pixies and sprites, who typically resemble small humanoids with insect wings. These folk are rare on Taelgar, but common in stories and tales. 

To represent these fey mechanically, you should use the [Fairy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/motm/fantastical-races#Fairy)traits. 

## Satyrs and other Beastfolk
By far the most famous and common of the potentially limitless beastfolk Fey are the satyrs, the horned humans with goat legs. Famous for their revelry, satyrs are often found in Taelgar seeking new experiences, merriment, and joy. 

To represent satyrs mechanically, you should use the [Satyr](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/motm/fantastical-races-continued#Satyr) traits. 

However, other beastfolk of fey origin likely exist in the world of Taelgar, and if you wish to play something particularly exotic, whose appearance will likely draw curiosity, comment, and wonder, the rabbit-like [Harengon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/motm/fantastical-races-continued#Harengon) may be a good choice. 

# Fey Traits
No matter which traits you choose to use to represent your Fey character, all Fey in Taelgar share a few common features. 

**Creature Type:** Fey. In addition, even if you were born on Taelgar, your native plane is considered to be the Feywild. If you die, your soul will return to the Feywild, perhaps to be reincarnated or reborn, perhaps to fade away. If you are subject to an effect that banishes you to your native plane, you will be returned to the Feywild, where you may be trappd if you are permanently banished. 

**Lifespan:** While Fey age, they do not age as regular mortals. Fey suffer no ill effects of old age, and do not change in appearance as they age, unless they wish to. Most fey live to be between 100 and 200 years before fading away, although some fey have been known to live much longer. 

# Languages

When you create your character, you may choose two [Languages](<../../background/languages.md>) in addition to those granted by other sources. One of these will usually be Common, also known as Westros, a widespread trade tongue in the western part of Taelgar. The other will usually be Sylvan.

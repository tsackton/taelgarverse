# Elf Species Details

*[D&D Beyond Mechanics Link](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/1755491-elf)*

The first of the Elder Folk to walk the world, [elves](<../elves.md>) have a deep connection to magic and nature through their connection their gods, [Aldanor](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/aldanor.md>), the Living Tree and [Elmerca](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/embodied-gods/elmerca.md>), the Wild Star. They do not die of old age, although many tire of the world, and it is rumored that some of the first elves to exist still walk the earth. The elves of Taelgar have also faced tragedy and loss, suffering and dying in cataclysmic wars that have shaken the world. These days, elves are few in number, and while some still look outward, others have turned inward, disavowing their ancient roles as protectors of Taelgar. Few elves live in the settlements other species, and many common folk will have never met one.

Elven culture and society is strongly shaped by the [Elven Cycle of Generations](<../../background/elven-cycle-of-generations.md>), know as the _ka_, a unique cycle system of non-overlapping generations arising from elves' extremely long lifespans but limited time when they can bear children. Elves can only have children for about a 30 year period, when the roots of Aldanor tie them to the Material Plane, but can live to be hundreds, or even thousands, of years old. This means that each generation is distinct and non-overlapping, and the elves count these, numbering from the first generation of the elves.

## Creating Your Elf Character

To create your elf character, consider first your age and your generation, or _ka_. If you were born in the 37th _ka_, you are likely between 120 and 150 years old. Many elves of this age are encouraged to leave their home, travel, explore, so this is a natural choice for an adventurer. If you wish to be older, consider what has made you an adventurer later in life. Consider also where you are from, and your relationship with your kin and other species.

A simple answer if engaging with the lore of elves is not of interest to you is that you came from an isolated elven kingdom (the kingdom of [Orenlas](<../../gazetteer/upper-istaros/orenlas/orenlas.md>) s a good choice), were born in the 37th _ka_ and are now spending the years of your life before you decide whether to return to your home traveling and adventuring.

### Elf Names

Elves in Taelgar typical have just a given name, using their ka, their homeland, or both if necessary for specificity. These names often have a lyrical sound, reflecting the Elvish language, with -o, -ion, -or, -on suffixes common for male names, and -e, -iel, -ril, -eth suffixes common for female names. To choose the name for your Elven character, you might consider looking at [name](https://realelvish.net/names/generator/) [generators](https://www.namegeneratorfun.com/elf), consider one of these ideas, or you might invent your own, which might not follow typical Elven patterns.

**Gender-Neutral Names:** Anglos, Amathrod, Astordil, Belegorn, Cadwar, Celebas, Culaf, Fothes, Glaeron, Gwindil, Hastor, Iorthon, Istor, Ningannel, Nillendur, Orosser, Sereg, Suldil, Tawaren, Tordil, Umbardil, Vanima

## Basic Traits

**Creature Type:** Humanoid  
**Size:** Medium (about 5–6 feet tall)  
**Speed:** 30 feet  
**Age**: Elves do not die of old age, but during each cycle of the _ka_, the pull of the material world weakens for them. Few elves remain on Taelgar beyond their fifth _ka_ (approximately 800 years).  
**Languages:** The long lifespan of elves means they typically learn many more languages than usual. You may select six [Languages](<../../background/languages.md>) during character creation. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency.

## Lizardfolk Traits

As an Lizardfolk, you have these special traits.





#### Aquatic Adaptations
You have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed, and you can hold your breath for up to 30 minutes at at time.

#### Natural Armor
You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

#### Omens of the Ancestors
You can reach your ancestors through the magic of the Tharzen Anzinakoa and beseech them for aid. You always have the Augury spell prepared. You can cast each spell you gain with this trait once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

#### Prophetic Vision
Your affinity for the dreamworld allows you to briefly see a moment ahead in time. If you fail a d20 Test, you can roll 1d4 and add the result to the d20, potentially changing a failure into a success. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest. 

#### Ancestral Aid

When you reach character level 3, you can beseech your ancestors for aid using one of the options below (choose the option each time you transform). Once you do this, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

- _**Ancestral Knowledge.**_ As an Action, you call upon the knowledge of your ancestors. You gain Proficiency with one Skill or Tool of your choice. This proficiency lasts for 1 hour. 

- _**Ancestral Protector.**_ As a Bonus Action, you call upon your ancestors to protect you. For 1 minute, ancestral spirits flit about you in a 10 foot Emanation. At the end of each of your turns, you can cause these spirits to inflict Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus to all creatures of your choice within the Emanation, and the area of the Emanation is Difficult Terrain for your Enemies. 

- _**Ancestral Tongues.**_ As an Action, you call upon the words of your ancestors. For 1 hour, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with Beasts. If you attempt to Influence them, you have Advantage on the d20 Test.

## Lizardfolk Traits

As an Lizardfolk, you have these special traits.





#### Aquatic Adaptations
You have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed, and you can hold your breath for up to 30 minutes at at time.

#### Natural Armor
You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

#### Omens of the Ancestors
You can reach your ancestors through the magic of the Tharzen Anzinakoa and beseech them for aid. You always have the Augury spell prepared. You can cast each spell you gain with this trait once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

#### Prophetic Vision
Your affinity for the dreamworld allows you to briefly see a moment ahead in time. If you fail a d20 Test, you can roll 1d4 and add the result to the d20, potentially changing a failure into a success. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest. 

#### Ancestral Aid
When you reach character level 3, you can beseech your ancestors for aid. 

(still working on this: idea 1/LR uses, no Concentration, duration depends on choice of aid)

Options: 
- Borrowed Knowledge (one skill proficiency for an hour)
- A limited form of spirit guardians (e.g. something like **Inner Radiance.** Searing light temporarily radiates from your eyes and mouth. For the duration, you shed Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, each creature within 10 feet of you takes Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.)
- Some kind of defensive feature, could be as simple as resistance to 1-2 damage types (probably choice of damage type is too strong, effectively a 3rd level spell), maybe a Protection from Good and Evil like effect, or an AC bonus like Shield of Faith
- Summon a spirit familiar? Or even something like the Summon Beast spell? This would probably require Concentration otherwise it could be too strong? 
- Other ideas?

# Languages 
***This is a work in progress and details may change as new areas of the world are explored in play. Characters will always have an opportunity to retcon their language choices if elements of this section are revised.***

Languages in the world of Taelgar are diverse, and yet the binding influence of magic and the gods have kept them from diverging too far apart. Nonetheless, individual languages described below typically represent clusters or language families, where knowledge of one member is assumed to represent knowledge of all.

Common languages: Westros, Eastros; Drankorian, Sembaran, Cymean, Chardonian, Dunmari, Vosic; Dwarven, Elvish; Goblin; Sylvan
Uncommon languages: Skaegish, Northlander; Stoneborn, Lizardling; Orcish, Giant, Centaur, Draconic; Primodial, Celestial, Shadowkar, Abyssal, Infernal
Rare languages: Northros; ~Extinct Eastern Language~; Halfling; Deep Speech, Exotic Languages
### Trade Languages
Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. Many non-human creatures also know trade languages, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. At the DM's discretion, conversing in trade language may lack nuance, and slightly increase the difficulty of any ability check that relies on clear understanding of meaning. 

- **Westros, or Common**: The primary trade tongue shared by all areas that were at one time under the sphere of influence of the Drankorian empire, and some adjacent areas, including Dunmar, and parts of Vostok and Skaerhem. 
- **Eastros** (tentative name): The primary trade tongue shared by the descendants of the ancient mariner people who settled the Green Sea. Most commonly spoken in the eastern half of the Green Sea, but can be heard as far west as Tollen and Cymea. 
- **Northros** (tentative name): Once the trade language of the first humans to spread across the northwestern part of Taelgar, but now largely forgotten. 
### Human Languages
* **Drankorian**: The original language of the Drankorian empire. While no longer commonly spoken, it is still used as a scholarly language in Chardon and parts of Sembara. Drankorian shares an alphabet and some similarities with Sembaran, Chardonian, and Cymean.
* **Sembaran**: A number of related languages and dialects spoken in Sembara, parts of Vorstok, and Cymea. Derived from Drankorian.
* **Chardonian**: A number of related dialects and languages spoken in Chardon and areas west of mountains. Derived from Drankorian.
* **Cymean**: A number of related dialects and languages spoken on the Cymean peninsula and along the coast of the Green Sea south of Cymea.
* **Dunmari**: A number of related languages derived from a southern tongue, unrelated to Drankorian, and spoken primarily in Dunmar. Adopted the Drankorian alphabet, however.
* **\<Unnamed Eastern Language>:** The language of the original people to settle the Green Sea. While now largely extinct, this alphabet lives on in the languages derived from it.
* **Skaegish**: A group of ancient languages spoken by the Skaer. Uses the same writing as old languages in Tywingha and highland areas of Sembara, although those old languages are largely extinct. Uses the Eastros/Eastern alphabet.
* **Vosic**: A number of related languages spoken by some of the highlanders and in the far north of Vostok. Related to Skaegish, but has diverged significantly. Uses the Eastros/Eastern alphabet.
* **Northlander**: A number of related ancient languages spoken by the original inhabitants of the lands west of the mountains, still spoken by a number of Northerlander communities, primarly the Mawar and the Deno'qai, who speak distinct, but mutually intelligible, dialects. 
### Non-Human Languages
* **Elder tongues**: The Elder Folk, created by the Embodied Gods, were endowed with language and writing by their creators. While some of these languages are commonly learned by non-native speakers, others are mysterious.
    * **Dwarvish:** The language of the dwarves, uses a runic script, often learned by outsiders and traders who want to engage in commerce with the dwarven kingdoms.
    * **Elvish:** The language of the elves, and often associated with magic. Frequently learned by scholars of magic or history. 
    * **Lizarding:** The language of the lizardfolk. Often learned by those who spend time living in lizardfolk communities.
    * **Halfing:** The secretive and rarely taught language of the halflings, made even more difficult for outsiders to learn given the expectation that speakers of this language will use telepathic cues for emphasis. 
    * **Stoneborn:** The language of the Stoneborn. Often learned by those who spend time in Stoneborn communities.
* **Goblin:** The language invented by the hobgoblins, and spoken by goblinoids of all types, as well as many of the servants and slaves of hobgoblins. Uses its own invented alphabet. While not commonly heard in the cities of Taelgar, it is not difficult to learn.
* **Orcish:** The language gifted to the orcs by Thark, the God of War. While few outsiders speak this language or understand its unique alphabet, those who would engage with orcs in combat or negotiation (to the extent such a thing is possible) do sometimes find a way to learn this tongue.
* **Giant:** The language created by the elder titans of old, and now spoken by the giants and their descendants. Often learned by scholars, or traders who would venture to giant settlements. Commonly learned by dwarves, especially those of the central mountains.
* **Deep Speech:** This language is more a rumor than a known fact, but is suspected to be the tongue of the alien abberations of the underdark, notably the mind flayers, their slaves and the twisted creations. Difficult to learn.
* **Draconic:** The language of dragons. Few learn the pure, **High Draconic** tongue of the ancient wyrms of old. More commonly heard in Taelgar is **Low Draconic**, the native tongue of kobolds and lesser dragons. However, these tongues are mutually intelligeble, and *PCs should simply take Draconic as a language and not worry about the distinction between low and high dialetcs.*
* **Centaur:** The language of centaurs. Uses the Elvish alphabet. Something that many might learn, although most centaurs speak Elvish, Sylvan, or both in addition to their own tongue, and most outsiders who must speak with them do so in one of those tongues. 
* **Exotic tongues:** Many other creatures in the world of Taelgar speak a language of their own, including many of the unusual or rarer races in the world. These might include the strange language of clicks and hisses the **Giant Eagles** speak, or the strange demonic-influenced barking tongue of **Gnolls.** Most of these are difficult, if not impossible, to learn to speak without magic (and few have a written alphabet).
* **Extraplanar languages:** Time and space do not work on the other planes as they do on the material plane, and each plane tends to be represented by a single language. These are typically difficult, although not impossible, for outsiders to learn.
    * **Sylvan:** The language of the Feywild, of satyrs and fairies and others. The most common extraplanar language to be learned by natives of the material plane.
    * **Shadowkar:** The language of the Shadowfell.
    * **Primordial:** The four related languages of the elemental planes (**Aquan**, **Auran**, **Terran**, **Ignan** for the planes of water, air, earth, and fire respectively).
    * **Abyssal:**  The language of the chaotic demons of the Abyss
    * **Infernal:** The language of devils and others native to the Nine Hells
    * **Celestial:** The language of the divine and all the creatures native to the Divine Realms.

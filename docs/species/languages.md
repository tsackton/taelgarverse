# LanguagesÂ 

The common languages of Taelgar spoken by [humans](<humans/humans.md>) and the Elder Folk all derive from the original languages spoken by the first of each species to awaken. For [dwarves](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>), [elves](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>), [halflings](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/halflings/halflings.md>), [stoneborn](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/stoneborn/stoneborn.md>), and [lizardfolk](<children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>) this original language has not changed since the dawn of time. For humans, the original tongue has been split and fractured into different language families over the long history of human settlement and migration.

The history of the languages of other sentient creatures is less well known by scholars, but in most cases,, although with some exceptions, whether due to magic, culture, or other factors, linguistic diversity within species is rare. 
## Human Language Families
The human tongues of the known world are broadly divided up into three major language families based on ancient migrations and cultural divisions on the original human homeland of Hkar:

* **Northros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken across the northern reaches of Taelgar, named Northros by Drankorian cataloguers of languages. These languages are spoken by the cultures that departed Hkar in the ancient days.
* **Eastros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken primarily across the eastern parts of the [Green Sea](<../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), as far west as [Skaer](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/skaerhem/skaerhem.md>). This language is derived from an ancient mariner culture that originally settled much of the [Green Sea](<../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) region, and these languages were given the name Eastros by Drankorian scholars.
* **Drankorian Language Family**: A set of languages spoken by [Drankor](<../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) and its successor cultures. It is derived from the language spoken on Hkar and the time of the [Downfall](<../events/ancient/the-downfall.md>).

There are some other human languages, notably Dunmari, that do not fit into any of the language families above, and there are rumors and fragments from Drankor of very different languages spoken in the far east or far south.


## Trade Languages
Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. Many non-human creatures also know trade languages, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. Trade tongues are best thought of as pidgins, and they rarely allow for the full nuance of a native tongue. There are two trade tongues in common usage: **Common** and **Eastros**. 
##### Common
An ancient trade tongue derived from the original language of humans, it is commonly used by non-humans, especially halflings to conduct business and trade, and is widely spoken by human traders and travelers, especially across the lands that were once part of the Drankorian Empire. Common is a trade pidgin, and as such has no native speakers and a less developed vocabulary than most languages. 

_Real world analog_: Undefined. Very few names or place names would be written in Common.
_Alphabet_: No native alphabet. When written, it is usually written phonetically in the speakers native alphabet.
_Intelligibility_: Most speakers of any human language can understand simple words in Common
##### Eastros
A trade pidgin derived from the languages of the Eastros language family, it is widely spoken in the eastern Green Sea, especially by the halfling sailors and those that trade with them. It can be heard as far west as Tollen and Cymea, and even occasionally in the port cities of Sembara., but it is very rarely spoken beyond the shores of the Green Sea. It has numerous loan words from ~Mariner Language~.

_Real world analog_: Balto-Slavic.
_Alphabet_: Eastros is written using the ~Mariner Alphabet~. 
*Intelligibility*: Speakers of ~Mariner Language~ can understand Eastros. 


## Drankorian Language Family
These are languages that derive from Drankorian, and are the native tongues of most of the lands that were once part of the Drankorian Empire. All Drankorian languages are written using the Drankorian alphabet.

After the fall of the Drankorian Empire, the Drankorian language developed into three main languages: Sembaran, a creole which blended the Eastros Old Tollish with Drankorian, Eastern Drankorian (which developed into Cymean and Isinguese), and Western Drankorian (which developed into Charodian and Illorian). 

_Real world analog: Drankorian and its language family is broadly based on Hellenic and Romance languages, with some small variations_
##### Drankorian
The ancient language spoken across the [Drankorian Empire](<../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), now preserved as a scholarly language. Although spoken conversation in Drankorian is rare, many scholarly and literary works are written in Drankorian.

_Real world analog_: Classical Latin; occasional Classical Greek loan words
_Alphabet_: Drankorian is written using the Drankorian alphabet
##### Cymean
A number of mutually understandable languages and dialects spoken in the Cymean peninsula. A descendant of the Drankorian tongue.

_Real world analog_: Spanish or Portugese, but with some Italian.
_Alphabet_: Cymean is written using the Drankorian alphabet
*Intelligibility*: Isinguese is a closely related language, and is usually mutually understandable with Cymean.
##### Isinguese
A number of mutually understandable languages and dialects spoken throughout the [Istaros Watershed](<../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/istaros-watershed.md>) before te destruction of [Isingue](<../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/isingue.md>). Today it survives amongst the Isinguese refugee communities, especially in the [Duchy of Maseau](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>) and the [Refounded Alliance of Aurbez](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/refounded-alliance-of-aurbez/refounded-alliance-of-aurbez.md>). 

_Real world analog_: Spanish or French, more French in the northern areas, Spanish to the south
_Alphabet_: Isinguese is written using the Drankorian alphabet
*Intelligibility*: Both Sembaran (especially southern Sembaran) ad Cymean are closely related, and are usually both understandable to speakers of Isinguese.
##### Chardonian
A number of mutually understandable languages and dialects spoken in Chardon and the Chardonian Empire, as well as areas under Chardonian influence in the [Yeraad](<../gazetteer/west-coast/rivers/yeraad.md>) and [Chasa](<../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/chasa.md>) river valleys. A descendant of the Drankorian tongue, although with Northros influences. Chardon sees itself as the inheritor of the Drankorian Empire, and intentionally imitates the Drankorian language in naming.

_Real world analog_: Italian or Latin, with occasional loan words from Classic Greek. Chardon itself tends to be more Latinate, in imitation of Drankor, whereas other dialects are more Italian.
_Alphabet_: Chardonian is written using the Drankorian alphabet
*Intelligibility*: Illorian is a closely related language, and is usually mutually understandable with Chardonian.


##### Illoria
The language spoken on the islands of [Illoria](<../gazetteer/west-coast/illoria.md>). 

_Real world analog_: Not defined. 
_Alphabet_: Illorian is written using the Drankorian alphabet
*Intelligibility*: Chardonian is a closely related language, and is usually mutually understandable with Illorian.


## Northros Language Family
These languages derive from the ancient tongues that were spoken by the first human migrants from Hkar. They use a diverse set of alphabets.

_Real world analog: Northros languages are based on Semitic languages_
##### Mawaran
The language spoken in the [Mawakel Peninsula](<../gazetteer/west-coast/mawar-confederacy/mawakel-peninsula.md>) and perhaps other areas once under its cultural influence. It is an ancient language, although there are numerous loan words from Drankorian languages in the modern day. 

_Real world analog_: Arabic
_Alphabet_: In the modern day Mawaran is written using the Drankorian alphabet.
##### Deno'qai
A group of mutually understandable dialects and languages spoken by the Deno'qai people. It is an ancient language, surviving largely without outside influences.

_Real world analog_: Hebrew or Arabic
_Alphabet_: The Deno'qai use a unique alphabet derived from Elvish
##### Old Zimkovan
The ancient language of the [Zimka](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/zimkova.md>) people, mostly no longer spoken outside of the most traditional and isolated parts of northern [Zimkova](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/zimkova.md>).

_Real world analog_: Maltese
_Alphabet_: Often written in Drankorian, but traditionally used its own alphabet dervived from Dwarven


## Eastros Language Family
All languages in the Eastros language family derive from ~Mariner Language~, the language spoken by the ancient seafaring culture that originally settled the eastern parts of the Green Sea. They mostly, but not exclusively, use the ~Mariner Language~ alphabet.

_Real world analog: Eastros languages are based on Scandinavian, Germanic, and Balto-Slavic languages_
##### Skaegish
The language spoken on the Skaer islands. 

_Real world analog_: Finnish or Norwegian, with some Swedish influences
*Alphabet*: ~Mariner Language~ alphabet
##### Old Tollish
The ancient language of Tollen and the Vostok and Sembaran coasts. A precursor tongue to Zimkovan, and related to Skaegish, it is rarely spoken today, but survives for its value in reading old inscriptions and documents amongst some Tollender academics. 

*Real world analog*: Balto-Slavic
*Alphabet*: ~Mariner Language~ alphabet
##### Zimkovan
A group of related languages and dialetics spoken in the highland kingdoms of [Ardlas](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/ardlas.md>), [Breva](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/breva.md>), and [Lavnoch](<../gazetteer/greater-sembara/zimkova/lavnoch.md>). It is commonly spoken in the rest of Zimkova as well. It is descended from Old Tollish, but was significantly influenced by Sembaran and Drankorian.

*Real world mapping*:  Baltic (Lithuanian or Latvian), although with some loan words from Maltese (Old Zimkovan). 
_Alphabet_: Written using the Drankorian alphabet. 
##### Urksan
The language of the closed realm of Ursk. It is very rarely spoken outside of Ursk, as Urskans use Eastros for trade. 

_Real world mapping_: Russian
*Alphabet*: ~Mariner Language~ alphabet
##### ~Mariner Language~
The ancient language of the mariner culture than left Hkar for the eastern Green Sea, it is extremely rare to find it still spoken today. 

_Real world mapping_: Balto-Slavic
*Alphabet*: ~Mariner Language~ alphabet



## Miscellaneous Languages
These languages are not well-classified into existing language families, usually because they are based on blended influences from multiple language families, or because they sit outside the main families. The alphabets and real world analogues of these languages are 

##### Dunmari
The language spoken by the Dunmari people. 

_Real world analog_: Hindi or other Indo-Iranian (Persian)
_Alphabet_: Dunmari is written using the Drankorian alphabet


##### Vosic
A collection of languages spoken by the [Vos](<../gazetteer/western-green-sea/vostok/vostok.md>). There are at least two common dialects and perhaps more, and these language evolved from diverse influences. 

_Real world analog_: Undetermined
_Alphabet_: Undetermined


##### Sembaran
A number of mutually understandable languages and dialects spoken in Sembara, Tyrwingha, and Addermarch. Originally a creole language that arose from a combination of Drankorian and Old Tollish, it is now its own language with complex relationships to both Drankorian and Eastros. Southern Sembaran has more Drankorian influences, whereas Northern Semabaran has more Eastros influences.

_Real world analog_: French (more prevalent in the South) and English (more prevalent in the north and Addermarch)
_Alphabet_: Sembaran is written using the Drankorian alphabet
*Intelligibility*: Tollish is mutually intelligible with Sembaran.
##### Tollish
The language spoken in Tollen and parts of the Tollen spheres of influence. It is closely related to Sembaran, and developed from a similar mix of Old Tollish and Drankorian. 

_Real world analog:_ English, with some Germanic or Slavic loan words
_Alphabet_: Sembaran is written using the Drankorian alphabet
*Intelligibility*: Tollish is mutually intelligible with Sembaran.

##### Tyrwinghan
The ancient language of Tyrwingha, still spoken by many Tyrwinghas especially in rural areas. 

_Real world analog_: Welsh
*Alphabet*: ~Mariner Language~ alphabet, although many Tyrwinghans are not aware of the shared alphabet with Skaegish and Old Tollish

##### Hkaran
The original human language, it still survives in a modified form in Common, but is otherwise no longer known to be spoken. Extremely rarely known in the modern day. 

_Real world analog_: Indo-European, broadly
*Alphabet*: The Hkaran alphabet, of which Drankorian is a derivative

## Non-Human Languages
There are many diverse languages amongst the non-human inhabitants of Taelgar, but with the chief exception of the goblinoids, it is rare for any given non-human species to speak more than one language. Some of these languages are commonly learned by outsiders, while others are rare, magical, or mythical. These languages are at least sometimes learned by outsiders, and in some cases, such as lizardfolk and dwarvish, there are many non-native speakers.  

##### Dwarvish
The language of the dwarves. It is often learned by outsiders and traders who want to engage in commerce with the dwarven kingdoms. It has remained essentially unchanged since the beginning of time, and there are no known dialects or variants.

*Real world mapping*: Tolkien Dwarvish
*Alphabet*: Dwarvish



##### Elvish
The language of the elves, and often associated with magic. The term "elvish" encompasses several different languages and variants of the language. Although all elves learn all the variants during their childhood, most outsiders will only understand a subset of elvish. It is frequently learned by scholars of magic or history.

*Real world mapping*: Tolkien Elvish
*Alphabet*: Elvish

##### Lizardling
The language of the lizardfolk. Often learned by those who spend time living in lizardfolk communities. Although there are numerous dialectics, they are all mutually comprehensible.

_Real world analog_: Basque
*Alphabet*: Lizardling is usually written in the local alphabet, i.e. Drankorian or Eastros, or occasionally, a simplified form of Elvish

##### Stoneborn
The language of the Stoneborn. Often learned by those who spend time in Stoneborn communities. There are no known variants or dialectics, and examples of writing are rare.

_Real world analog_: Xhosan
*Alphabet*: A unique alphabet derived from the runes of Giants
##### Orcish
The language gifted to the orcs by Thark, the God of War. While few outsiders speak this language, those who would engage with orcs in combat or negotiation (to the extent such a thing is possible) do sometimes find a way to learn this tongue. There are no known examples of Orcish writing.  

_Real world analog_: Turkic
*Alphabet*: None known


##### Free Orcish
The [People of the Rainbow](<../groups/orc-hordes/people-of-the-rainbow.md>) speak a dialect of Orcish that although based on Orcish, has numerous additional words. Although most speakers of Orcish can communicate with the People of the Rainbow, their orcish dialect is not always understandable to those who only know traditional orcish.  

_Alphabet_: The free Orcs have developed a writing system based on a modified Drankorian alphabet.

##### Goblin
A term for a large number of related languages spoken by hobgoblins and their slaves and allies. Hobgoblin clans often invent secret languages for themselves, but a common creole, derived from the language spoken by Cha'mutte's armies, is the closest thing to a common language. It is called _katonylev_ (or "army tongue") by speakers, but for most outsiders this is what is known as Goblin.

_Real world analog_: Katonylev is based on Hungarian. Other hobgoblin languages may have diverse real world mappings.
*Alphabet*: Hobgoblins and other goblinoids use a uniquely created Hobgoblin alphabet, which tends to be shared across languages.
##### Giant
The language created by the elder titans of old, and now spoken by the giants and their descendants. Often learned by scholars, or traders who would venture to giant settlements. Commonly learned by dwarves, especially those of the Sentinels.

_Real world analog_: Old Norse
*Alphabet*: Giant
##### Halfling
The secretive and rarely taught language of the halflings, made even more difficult for outsiders to learn given the expectation that speakers of this language will use telepathic cues for emphasis.  The halflings' language is preserved and learned via the racial consciousness; a single dialect covers all halflings across the world, even on diverse continents. The halflings rarely, if ever, teach their secretive language to outsiders. As far as outsiders know, there is no written form of halfling. 

_Real world mapping_: Igbo, but may change or be diverse
*Alphabet*: Unknown

### Exotic Languages
Many other creatures in the world of Taelgar speak a language of their own, including many of the unusual or rarer races in the world. These might include the strange language of clicks and hisses the **Giant Eagles** speak, or the strange demonic-influenced barking tongue of **Gnolls.** Most of these are difficult, if not impossible, to learn to speak without magic (and few have a written alphabet).

There is a wide diversity of these exotic languages but they are almost never spoken by outsiders, although two are languages at least known to the scholars of Tollen and Chardon:

##### Centaur
The language of centaurs. Rarely, but not never, taught to outsiders. Most centaurs speak Elvish, Sylvan, or both in addition to their own tongue, and most outsiders who must speak with them do so in one of those tongues.

_Real world mapping_: Diverse, but names often have a classical Greek element
_Alphabet_: Unknown


##### Kenku
The kenku have their own language, although whether the kenku of the north and those of the east speak the same, or different, languages is not recorded. 

_Real world mapping_: Sioux
_Alphabet_: Unknown

### Extra-Planar Languages
Time and space do not work on the other planes as they do on the material plane, and each plane tends to be represented by a single language. These are typically difficult, although not impossible, for outsiders to learn. 

The most common extra-planar language spoken in Taelgar is **Sylvan**, the language of the Feywild:
##### Sylvan
The language of the [Feywild](<../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), also commonly spoken by fairies, satyrs, and other fey inhabitants of Taelgar, as well as elves, Tyrwinghans, and others who have substantial dealings with the fey. It is a lilting and musical language and hints at magical power.

_Real world analog_: None, specifically, but it should sound lyrical. Many existing Fey names use Classic Greek, but Polynesian or Hawaiian might be interesting places for inspiration.
_Alphabet_: The Sylvan language is written with a complex script with numerous characters, although transliterations to Elvish characters are common amongst non-native speakers.

Natives of the Outer Realms, often called the Children of Creation or Children of Belief are the native inhabitants of the Spiritual Realms.

Fiends, including [Devils](<./devils.md>) and [Demons](<./demons.md>) inhabit the Nine Hells and the [Abyss](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/other-realms/abyss.md>). 

[Celestials](<./celestials.md>) typically spring from the divine realms of gods, such as [Arkaash](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/arkaash.md>) of the [Dunmari gods](<../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>) or the [Heart of the Mountain](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>) of the [Bahrazel](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel/bahrazel.md>).

The [Gidari](<./gidari.md>) are the guardians of the [Land of the Dead](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/land-of-the-dead.md>), the guides that protect the souls of the recently deceased as they await their ultimate fate.

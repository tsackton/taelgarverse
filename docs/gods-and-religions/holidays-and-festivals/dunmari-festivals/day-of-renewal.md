# Day of Renewal

This holiday has no fixed date; it is celebrated on the day following the first monsoon rains of the season, and thus celebrated at different times across Dunmar. 

The Day of Renewal celebrates and remembers Jeevali’s tears, and the sacrifice and blessing of the land they represent. It is a day of reflection and personal prayer, and also a day of thanksgiving to the gods. There are no major communal rites associated with this holiday, but many people will save some special treat or drink for the evening meal on the Day of Renewal, and there are a number of common prayers of thanksgiving associated with this day.

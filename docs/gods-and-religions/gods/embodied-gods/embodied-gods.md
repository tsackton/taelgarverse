# Embodied Gods



The divinities known as the Embodied Gods are the direct creations of the [High Gods](<../high-gods/high-gods.md>), given physical form, permanence and consciousness, and the power to create. Unlike the [Incorporeal Gods](<../incorporeal-gods/incorporeal-gods.md>), the Embodied Gods do not depend upon belief for their power. 

The most well known of the Embodied Gods are the deities of the Elder Folk, created by the [Divine Presence](<../high-gods/divine-presence.md>), and often known as the Firstborn. These are: [Aldanor](<./aldanor.md>) and [Elmerca](<./elmerca.md>), the Living Tree and the Wild Star of the elves; Entamba, the Elder Mountain of the stoneborn; Hazkunde, Bero, Udazkena, and Negu, sometimes known as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, the four Tharzen Anzinakoa of the lizardfolk; the [Ruler](<bahrazel/uzdan.md>), [Runecrafter](<bahrazel/karthel.md>), [Priest](<bahrazel/fanrukel.md>), [Warrior](<bahrazel/azar.md>), [Traveler](<bahrazel/maganna.md>), [Stoneworker](<bahrazel/tarbaka.md>), and [Farmer](<bahrazel/oshkir.md>), the seven [Bahrazel](<bahrazel/bahrazel.md>) of the dwarves; and [Nwana](<first-ones/nwana.md>), called the Stranger-Child, [Obito](<first-ones/obito.md>), called the Merchant-Musician, and [Jemghari](<first-ones/jemghari.md>), called the Traveler-Storyteller, the two-faced [First Ones](<first-ones/first-ones.md>) of the halflings.

Less well understood among the Embodied Gods are the creations of the [Three Despairs](<../high-gods/three-despairs.md>), imbued with the same divine power as the Firstborn, but twisted for destructive ends. Among these, the most widely known is [Thark](<./thark.md>), the God of War Without End, created by the union of [Umidzka](<../high-gods/umidzka.md>) and [G'Zab](<../high-gods/g-zab.md>), who gave rise to the orcs, and through his compulsion drives them to violence for the sake of violence. Elven lore records rumors of other embodied gods spawned by the Three Despairs, including Ghesyn, the Goddess of the End, also known as the Hopeless One, the offspring of [G'Zab](<../high-gods/g-zab.md>) and [Jinnik](<../high-gods/jinnik.md>); the Endless Chaos, the offspring of [Umidzka](<../high-gods/umidzka.md>) and [Jinnik](<../high-gods/jinnik.md>); and the[Mad One](<./mad-one.md>), the embodied avatar of [Jinnik](<../high-gods/jinnik.md>).

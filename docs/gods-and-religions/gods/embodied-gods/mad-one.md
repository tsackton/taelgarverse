# The Mad One

Little is known about the Mad One, other than that they are the patron deity of lycanthropes, and are associated with the plane of [Pandemonium](<../../../cosmology/spiritual-realms/pandemonium.md>). Theologically, they are, like the firstborn gods of the Elder races, an Embodied God, given physical form independent of the belief of their worshippers. 

The Mad One was created by [Jinnik](<../high-gods/jinnik.md>), one of the [Three Despairs](<../high-gods/three-despairs.md>), the god-like entities born of the [Void Mind](<../high-gods/void-mind.md>).

# Three Despairs



The fragments of the Void Mind, who stole divine power, enough to reshape and misdirect acts of creation for their own purpose. The Three Despairs are not quite gods, or at least different in kind than other gods, but are powerful in their own right.

The Three Despairs are:
- [Jinnik](<./jinnik.md>), known primarily through their embodied avatar the [Mad One](<../embodied-gods/mad-one.md>), associated with madness and the curse of lycanthropy
- [Umidzka](<./umidzka.md>), associated with emptiness and despair, and sometimes considered the creator of Undead
- [G'Zab](<./g-zab.md>), called the All-Consuming, associated with selfishness, greed, destruction, and war

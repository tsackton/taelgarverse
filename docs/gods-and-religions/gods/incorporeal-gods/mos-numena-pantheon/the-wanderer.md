# The Wanderer







A deity in the [Mos Numena](<../../../religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) pantheon, and one of the [Incorporeal Gods](<../incorporeal-gods.md>) of humanity. 

The Wanderer is usually depicted as a young man, dressed as a traveler or a merchant, in a cloak, with a walking staff or a scale. He is the god of travel, trade, and hospitality, and also strangers, outcasts, the downtrodden and those at the edge of society, by choice or birth. He is associated with the stars, and the virtues of charity and hospitality, and watches over journeys, markets, and inns.

In many lands, it is traditional for [Mos Numena](<../../../religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) temples to have a small room or cot for travelers, known as The Wanderer's Cot.

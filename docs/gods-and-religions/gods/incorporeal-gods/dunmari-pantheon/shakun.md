# Shakun

A demigod associated with the [the Five Siblings](<../../../religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>) of the Dunmari religion, and one of the [Incorporeal Gods](<../incorporeal-gods.md>) of humanity. 

Shakun is the goddess of illusion, magic, prophecy, and dreams; often said to be the mystical protector of the Dunmari, looking to unseen dangers and magical threats. She is the Divine twin sister of [Kotana](<../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/kotana.md>), the second Samraat of the [Aatmaji Dynasty](<../../../../groups/dunmari-dynasties/aatmaji-dynasty.md>); Shakun and [Kotana](<../../../../people/historical-figures/dunmari-rulers/kotana.md>) are said to be the children of [Bhishma](<./bhishma.md>), the founder of [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>), and the god [Laka](<./laka.md>). 

Her mystery cult, the [Shakun Mystai](<../../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/shakun-mystai.md>) have always been associated with omens and dreams, and interpreting the signs of dangers lurking for the Dunmari. They also help maintain the magical web of protection that Shakun weaves around the eastern border of [Dunmar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) to keep the dangers of the [Nashtkar](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/nashtkar.md>) from civilizations.

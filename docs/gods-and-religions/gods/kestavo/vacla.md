### Vacla
*he/him*

A malevolent spirit in the tradition of the *[Kestavo](<../../religions/northern-folk-religions/kestavo.md>)*, known as the fire-below. His children are the spirits of war and destruction, of injury, of sudden death, of the burning home. They are feared and driven off, whenever possible.

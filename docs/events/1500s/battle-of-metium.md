# Battle of Metium

A huge victory for [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), fought on the banks of the [Chasa](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/chasa.md>) river near the city of [Metium](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/metium.md>). Led to the total destruction of the conclave of dragons that formed in the aftermath of [Cha'mutte](<../../people/extraplanar-powers/cha-mutte.md>)'s death and led many of the battles and wars in the west in the [Blood Years](<./blood-years.md>).

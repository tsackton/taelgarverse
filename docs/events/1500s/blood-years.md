# The Blood Years

An informal name for the roughly fifty year period after the [Great War](<./great-war.md>), marked by continued conflict in the many parts of the world.

## Major Events of the Blood Years






Adding some brainstorming and notes, based in large part on Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte. 

(1) In Chardon, this is likely considered to be the period from 1545 - 1597 or whatever, with the defeat of the Shadow Armada marking the end of the Blood Years. From a Chardonian point of view the Blood Years are largely about the trajectory of Chardon power - during the Blood Years, it feels like Chardon's power is still getting pressed and shrunk by the remnants of Cha'mutte (and other dangers). So the end of the Blood Years marks a shift in the balance of power from the "forces of evil" to the "forces of good". In a span of a few years, you have the defeat of the Shadow Armanda, the defeat of the Central Branch of the Cha'mutte's army (occupying Amani), and the emergence of the Mawar. 

(2) in Sembara, the blood years are in many ways more about the creepy magic of the Plaguelands. Sembara loses far more territory in the hobgoblin wars against the Shattered Ice clan than during the wars of the Blood Years, but the magical plagues and curses that emerge seem far more threatening and scary, I suspect. So the 1560s, with good harvests and peace for a good 10 years before the hobgoblin wars is a natural dividing point. 

(3) In Dunmar, the hobgoblin threat is always lingering until the twin events of the decisive defeat of the [Blackened Claw](<../../groups/hobgoblin-clans/blackened-claw.md>) clan in 1610 and the final form of Shakun's protection "coming online" sometime roughly around the same time. So in Dunmar I think the Blood Years would canonically be considered to end in 1610. From this point, no serious threat emerges in the east until Apollyon, really, although there are some occasional minor disruptions. 

(4) Elsewhere, I think the concept of the Blood Years is probably not particularly a thing. From e.g. Ursk's point of view, their was either no lingering dangers from the Great War or perhaps more accurately they are still facing the lingering dangers of [Vimfrost's War](<./vimfrost-s-war.md>), but there is not a long period of reverberations. Farther east and south, history is not well developed and it is not clear what, if any, impact the Great War had.

# Vimfrost's War

A war fought between the allies and minions of the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, including orcs, trolls, and various monstrosities from the north, and the united forces of the frost giants of [Kaldhalla](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/kaldhalla.md>), dwarves and stoneborn of the [Svinjo Mountains](<../../gazetteer/northern-green-sea/svinjo-mountains.md>), and the human armies of [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) and [Vostok](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/vostok/vostok.md>). 

Ultimately, the united forces under [Derik III](<../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/derik-iii.md>) and [Bjarnfrost](<../../people/giants/bjarnfrost.md>) defeated Vimfrost, albeit at great cost, including the death of [Bjarnfrost](<../../people/giants/bjarnfrost.md>). 

During the course of [Vimfrost's War](<./vimfrost-s-war.md>), the vast, ancient wall that stretches across much of northern [Vostok](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/vostok/vostok.md>), known as the [Gråstenvakt](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/vostok/grastenvakt.md>), was rediscovered and partially repaired.

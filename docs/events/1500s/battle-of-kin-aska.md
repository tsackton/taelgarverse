# The Battle of Kin-Aska



An important battle in the [Blood Years](<./blood-years.md>). [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) and its allies were defeated, leading to the destruction of a city-state, [Kin-Aska](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/kin-aska.md>), that had fallen into [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>)'s orbit in the years before the [Great War](<./great-war.md>).

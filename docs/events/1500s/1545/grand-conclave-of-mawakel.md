title: Grand Conclave of Mawakel
---

A grand conclave called in 1545 between the Mawar and the salt lizardfolk, who, through the gatza ceremonies, had a foretelling of further danger to come. At the conclave, it was agreed to undertake a great magic to hide the land, as much as it could be hidden. 

The same conclave met again in 1590 and decided to dismiss the [Fog of Mawar](<../fog-of-mawar.md>) after word and news of the end of the [Blood Years](<../blood-years.md>) spread.

# The Fog of Mawar

A enchanted fog summoned by the druids of coast and wood, the salt [lizardfolk](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/lizardfolk/lizardfolk.md>), and many others working together in the aftermath of the [Grand Conclave of Mawakel](<1545/grand-conclave-of-mawakel.md>). It came at great cost, and required endless vigilance along the borders. But as a result the weather, for much of the next fifty years, was made to protect the peninsula.

It lasted from 1545 until it was dismissed by the [second conclave](<1545/grand-conclave-of-mawakel.md>) in 1590.

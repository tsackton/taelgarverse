# The Battle of Shadowfire



A major defeat for [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>) during the Conclave War, when the dragon conclave unleashed their full might during the wars of the [Blood Years](<./blood-years.md>).  Fought on the banks of the [Chasa](<../../gazetteer/major-rivers/chasa-nahadi-watershed/chasa.md>), about 250 miles northeast of [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>). The [remnants of the dragonfire](<../../gazetteer/greater-chardon/chardonian-empire/chasa-river-valley/scar-of-shadowfire.md>) of this battle still scar the land, and nothing grows.

# Battle of Shadowfire

A major defeat for [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), when the dragon conclave unleashed their full might during the wars of the [Blood Years](<./blood-years.md>).  Fought on the banks of the [Chasa](<../../gazetteer/chasa-nahadi-watershed/rivers/chasa.md>), about 250 miles northeast of [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>). The remnants of the dragonfire of this battle still scar the land, and nothing grows.

# The Exile of Fraternity of the Empty Moon

The Exile of the Fraternity of the Empty Moon was a campaign waged over the course of four months in the summer of the 68th year of the Nayan Dynasty (DR 1625). 

The [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>), a werewolf cult dedicated to the advancement of the [Mad One](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/mad-one.md>), was driven from [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) during the course of this campaign, waged by the Dunmari under Commander [Ila](<../../people/historical-figures/ila.md>), the local garrison commander responsible for the defense of [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) at the time. 

The werewolves had established a base in abandoned ruins north of the city, build over an [extraplanar weak point](<../../cosmology/multiverse/extraplanar-weak-point.md>) connected to [Pandemonium](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/primal-realms/pandemonium.md>). The energy leaking from the plane of madness prevented easy approach for the warriors under Commander [Ila](<../../people/historical-figures/ila.md>), until a [map](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/treasure/treasure-from-tokra/dunmari-map-of-pandemonium-ruins.md>) was created that documented a magical route allowing approach of the ruins. 

The last werewolves in [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) were executed in August of the 68th year of the Nayan Dynasty, but a significant fraction of the [Fraternity of the Empty Moon](<../../groups/fraternity-of-the-empty-moon.md>) was able to escape east.

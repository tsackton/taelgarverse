### The Second Hobgoblin War


A brutal war fought in the north of [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) against the [Blackened Claw](<../../groups/hobgoblin-clans/blackened-claw.md>) hobgoblin clan, from 1603-1610 in the Drankorian reckoning. 

Ended is a complete and total Dunmari victory, with the hobgoblins crushed.

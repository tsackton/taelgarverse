### The Enst Campaign of the Third Hobgoblin War

A series of battles between [Sembara](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) and the [Shattered Ice Clan](<../../../groups/hobgoblin-clans/shattered-ice-clan.md>) that pushed the hobgoblins south of the [Enst](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). Characterized by exceptionally bad luck on the part of the hobgoblins, which is attributed in Sembara to Cece's personal connection to the [The Father](<../../../gods-and-religions/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena-pantheon/the-father.md>)

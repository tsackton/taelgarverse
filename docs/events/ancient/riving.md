# The Riving





The long pause, the moment out of time during which the Embodied Gods reshaped the world, ended with the Riving. Drawing on the full strength of their endless Divine power, [Arha](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/high-gods/divine-presence.md>) and [Malik](<../../gods-and-religions/gods/high-gods/divine-presence.md>) sundered the multiverse, ripping the echo realms from the material plane, making the world round and the land fixed in form, and, some say, spawning an endless number of parallel realities. Before the Riving, the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/feywild.md>), the [Shadowfolds](<../../cosmology/demiplanes-and-echo-realms/shadowfolds.md>), all the echo realms, were intertwined with the material plane, but at the moment of the Riving the layers were pulled apart and the echo planes separated into their own realms, still resonating and vibrating with the material plane, but no longer part of it.

Diminished in power as the boundaries around the material plane grew thicker and the influx of magic to the world of Taelgar grew weaker, many of the children of the divine fled, or were banished, in this instant. Scholars and loremasters have long sought to catalog and understand the full story of this exodus. While much is not known, most loremasters agree that the archfey and their spawn followed the dreams and shadows into the echo realms, the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/feywild.md>) and the [Shadowfolds](<../../cosmology/demiplanes-and-echo-realms/shadowfolds.md>); and the elder elementals and their creations fled to the Elemental Planes that were the source of their energy and power. Where the great wyrms and titans went, and whether indeed all left the material plane, is a subject of great debate.Â 

As the multiverse was sundering in the Riving, the realms of the embodied gods spun from the [Plane of Souls](<../../cosmology/plane-of-souls.md>) and their imaginations, where the form of the land could still be reshaped with a thought.

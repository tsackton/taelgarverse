# The Zombie Plague in Cleenseau

In the first two months of 1720, the dead rose across southern Sembara, especially [Wisford](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/heartlands/wisford.md>), [Dunfry](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/western-marches/dunfry.md>), and [Ainwick](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-ainwick/ainwick.md>). They rose in clusters and sporadically. Some places were barely harmed, other places had hundreds of zombies descend upon them. 

These attacks were devastating, and in many places entire villages were destroyed. The dead rose in two waves - the first wave over the nights of January 5th, 6th, and 7th. The second, much smaller wave, arose during the new moon, of February 3rd, 4th, and 5th.

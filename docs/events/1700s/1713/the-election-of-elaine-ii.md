On June 3rd, 1713, [Cece I](<../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/cece-i.md>) finally passed after several months of illness. Her son, [Robert I](<../../../people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/robert-i.md>) was her only surviving offspring, and her named heir. However, the [Oracles](<../../../groups/oracle-of-the-riven.md>) of Tyrwingha, for mysterious reasons, refused to elect him.

# The Summer of Red Storms

In the year 1709 DR, the monsoons brought not just rain but rampaging half-human, half-hyena creatures (gnolls), who raided villages as far west as the [Hara](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/rivers/hara-watershed/hara.md>) river valley for two months before they were stopped. 

Researched by [Govir](<../../../people/dunmari/govir.md>) in the [Tokra](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) [Archives](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>).

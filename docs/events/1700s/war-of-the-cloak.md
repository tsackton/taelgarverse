# The War of the Cloak

A war fought between the armies of [Grash](<../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) and the orcs of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>), aided by [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>), over the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>). 

The war began when [Grash](<../../people/other-nonhumans/grash.md>) marched east from his bases in Kharsan, aiming to defeat the orcs of [Xurkhaz](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/xurkhaz.md>) and in the process steal the [Cloak of Rainbows](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/cloak-of-rainbows.md>) from [Lubash](<../../people/orcs/lubash.md>). After an initial strike force led by [Kadmos](<../../people/chardonians/kadmos.md>) failed to recover the cloak, and Grash's undead armies were prevented from entering [Uzgukhar](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/xurkhaz/uzgukhar.md>) by the powerful magic of [Riswynn](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/riswynn.md>), Grash besieged the city. The siege was broken, and Grash killed, by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>).

# The Awakened Soul Disaster

In the year DR 1718, the monks of the [Order of the Awakened Soul](<../../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/order-of-the-awakened-soul.md>), with the aid of [Rai](<../../../people/pcs/great-war/rai.md>), attempted to remove the extraplanar corruption from the Plaguelands. This effort failed, and as a consequence Rai's power was diminished and the monks were scattered, perhaps to other planes or distant parts of the material plane.


Described, from Rai's perspective, in [Second Dream of Rai](<../../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/dreams-and-visions/second-dream-of-rai.md>).

## Attempted Poisoning of Cleenseau
A group of bandits lead by [Francois the Bandit](<../../../../people/sembarans/francois-the-bandit.md>) attempted to poison the [Army Garrison of Cleenseau](<../../../../groups/sembaran-army/army-garrison-of-cleenseau.md>) and much of the rest of the populace during the [Festival of the Bridge](<../../../../time/holidays-and-festivals/festival-of-the-bridge.md>). Using a purgative derived from [Gentza](<../../../../people/lizardfolk/gentza.md>)'s research the group was apparently planning on sickening much of the defensive strength of the town and then burning as much of it down as they could.

The ultimate motives for this action were not clear, although the leader, [Francois the Bandit](<../../../../people/sembarans/francois-the-bandit.md>) admitted when questioned by [Robin](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) that he was recruited for this by a mysterious shadowy figure who spoke to him in his dreams. His payment was extensive but as to why a shadowy figure would want to burn the town, he did not know.

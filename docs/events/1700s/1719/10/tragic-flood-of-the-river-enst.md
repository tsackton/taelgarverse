# The Tragic Flood of the River Enst

After a morning of heavy rain, the [Enst](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>) unexpected flooded its banks in several places between [Cleenseau](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) and [Rinburg](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/rinburg.md>). The three children of [Rosalind Essford](<../../../../people/sembarans/rosalind-essford.md>) and their nursemaid were swept away. In the aftermath, [Rinault](<../../../../people/sembarans/rinault-essford.md>) took the [Lord's Guard of Cleenseau](<../../../../groups/sembaran-political-units/lord-s-guard-of-cleenseau.md>) out "hunting", convinced there was an unexplained nefarious agent at work. This left [Cleenseau](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) significantly understaffed when the [Cleenseau Spider Attacks](<./cleenseau-spider-attacks.md>) began.

# The Second Spider Attack on Tavoise



In the early pre-dawn morning of October 21st, the spiders attacked [Taviose](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/taviose.md>) a second time. 

The party learned of this attack a few hours after it happened, and after discussing the events with the survivors in [Cleenseau](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) and throughouly searching the hamlet (where [Izgil](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>) was aided by a mysterious sense of making connections between what he was seeing and his memories) the party was able to reconstruct what happened as follows:

In the predawn, five spiders (one large one and four dog-sized ones) crept into the hamlet on webs flung from the eaves of the forest. Each spider swung into a house at about the same time and quickly murdered the inhabitants of the houses they had attacked.

One group of families lead by [Hugh Darrow](<../../../../people/sembarans/hugh-darrow.md>) fled west through the eaves of the [Wood](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau-wood.md>) and made it to Clenseau about two hours after the attack. They were quick to leave, and reported that [Perrin](<../../../../people/sembarans/perrin-voclain.md>) was originally with them, but they waved him back into the village to help the others.

A second group of families was pinned down by the spiders, and only escaped after [Perrin](<../../../../people/sembarans/perrin-voclain.md>) and three other villagers killed the largest spider and one of the smaller ones. This group fled east to [Valit](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/valit.md>) as the remaining three spiders each dragged a body into [the Wood](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau-wood.md>). 

A trail of blood was seen leaving the village, as was a set of webs, both heading into [the Wood](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau-wood.md>). 

[Perrin](<../../../../people/sembarans/perrin-voclain.md>) made it safely, but badly injured, to [Valit](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/valit.md>) along with several others. One of the villages who helped kill the spiders died from injuries before reaching [Valit](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/valit.md>). 

Taking a headcount, the party is able to determine that of the 48 people living in [Taviose](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/taviose.md>), 14 have died, 12 made it safely to [Cleenseau](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), and 19, including [Perrin](<../../../../people/sembarans/perrin-voclain.md>), [Brot Starsearcher](<../../../../people/dwarves/brot-starsearcher.md>), and [Diesla Starsearcher](<../../../../people/dwarves/diesla-starsearcher.md>) made it to [Valit](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/valit.md>). The remaining three are missing and presumed dragged into the forest. At least one of the three was believed to be alive, but paralyzed.

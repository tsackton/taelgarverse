### First Spider Attack on Taviose
*October 20th, 1719; 10am*

A giant spider (the size of a horse) and three large spiders (the size of dogs) attacked the hamlet of [Taviose](<../../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/taviose.md>) in the mid-morning. 

A large spider crept out of the woods onto the roof of [Perrin Voclain's](<../../../../people/sembarans/perrin-voclain.md>) house and attacked him when he came outside to investigate. The timely intervention of [Viepuck](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>), [Izgil](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>), [Celyn](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>), and [Robin](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) prevented worse disaster. The three smaller spiders snuck through the fields and tried to ambush the party, but [Celyn](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) spotted two of the three before they could strike. 

[Viepuck](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) was able to badly damage the largest spider with eldritch magic, before being paralyzed by a smaller one. [Robin](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) rode down one spider, [Izgil](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>) destroyed one by calling down the power of the moon on it, and [Celyn](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>)-- after vanishing a misty sparkle and reappearing next to [Robin](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>) was able to skewer the final one in the eye.

[Perrin](<../../../../people/sembarans/perrin-voclain.md>) was badly injured, but saved by the actions of [Viepuck](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>), [Izgil](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/izgil-moonseeker.md>), and [Robin](<../../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/robin-of-abenfyrd.md>), who magically healed him.

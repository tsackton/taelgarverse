# The Day of Renewal

Celebrated on the day following the first monsoon rains of the season. 

A day marking Jeevaliâ€™s tears, the sacrifice and renewal of the land they represent. No fixed date, but this festival is acknowledged on the day following the first monsoon rains of the season. It is a day of reflection and personal prayer, and also a day of thanksgiving to the gods. Many people will save some special treat or drink for the evening meal on the Day of Renewal, but otherwise is often a very personal feast day.

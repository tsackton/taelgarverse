# Jaankar

[Chidya](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/chidya.md>)'s Feast Day, celebrated around July 21/22, when the month of the summer solstice ends. 

A celebration of life, of the next generation of animals, and also of wildness and spontaneity. Celebrated for two days, first by ceremony and thanks for the next generation and the life of horses, lambs, and the other animals on which the Dunmari depend, and then from sundown to sundown a wild party.

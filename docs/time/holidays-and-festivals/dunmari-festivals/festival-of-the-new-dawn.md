# The Festival of the New Dawn

The Festival of the New Dawn is a Dunmari religious festival, strongly associated with the deity [Laka](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/laka.md>), and celebrated on January 23rd each year. It marks the beginning of the new year and a new cycle of the seasons, and is considered the first day of the new year in the Dunmari reckoning. Traditions include a pre-dawn vigil, often including magical rituals to invoke Laka's blessing for the past and the future, and a procession/mystery play/recitation of the history of the Dunmari people from creation until today. 

This is also thought to be a time when, as the light of the first sun of the new year awakens the world, the barriers between planes are permeable, and messages can reach the souls of the dead more easily.

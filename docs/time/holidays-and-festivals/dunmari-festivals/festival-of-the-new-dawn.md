# Festival of the New Dawn

Celebrated on January 23rd. This marks the beginning of the new year and a new cycle of the seasons. The first day of the new year, in the Dunmari reckoning. Strongly associated with Laka. Traditions include a pre-dawn vigil, often including magical rituals to invoke Laka's blessing for the past and the future, and a procession/mystery play/recitation of the history of the Dunmari people from creation until today. 

This is also thought to be a time when, as the light of the first sun of the new year awakens the world, the barriers between planes are permeable, and messages can reach the souls of the dead more easily.

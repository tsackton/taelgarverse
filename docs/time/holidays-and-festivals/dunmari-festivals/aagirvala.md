# Aagirvala

[Aagir](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/aagir.md>)'s Feast Day, celebrated on the first full moon after the autumnal equinox. 

A day to mark victory in battle, but also remember and acknowledge the viciousness of the war of conquest of the Dunmari, and remember those killed in anger. Can be a tense holiday, as it also has strongly nationalistic vibes. 

Aagirvala is typically celebrated with feats of strength and endurance, tournaments, and demonstrations of skill at weapon smithing and metalwork.

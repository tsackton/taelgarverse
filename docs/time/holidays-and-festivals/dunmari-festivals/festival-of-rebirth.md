# The Festival of Rebirth

[Jeevali](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/jeevali.md>)'s Feast Day. Celebrated on the first full moon after the vernal equinox, marking the beginning of summer. 

This festival celebrates [Jeevali](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/jeevali.md>)’s resurrection. This is one of the most important festivals of the the year, and is almost always associated with large communal fairs and celebrations around temples, and the coming together of dispersed communities. Strongly associated with [Jeevali](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/jeevali.md>) and [Bhishma](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/bhishma.md>).

In [Karawa](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), the fair and games and market that happen before the Festival of Rebirth are particularly notable as they draw a wide, diverse crowd from across the desert lands. 

The Festival of Rebirth is typicalled celebrated as follows. Beginning the evening before the feast day, the priests and priestesses carry a tall sculpture, shaped like a tree in Karawa but taking other forms across [Dunmar](<../../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>). In Karawa, it is made of vines, and dried flowers, and bits of wood and seeds all pulled together into a trunk, with a design that spirals up to a crown of branches and leaves at the top. 

The sculpture is carried in a procession to a public place of gathering -- in the desert on the edge of town in Karawa, where the priests tell the story of [Jeevali](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/jeevali.md>)’s miracle. When the Dunmari first settled the land, it was dry and dead, a barren landscape cursed by the plague. The people suffered, and died, from drought and hunger and fear. [Jeevali](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/jeevali.md>) wept for her people, crying tears that poured from the heavens, cleansing the land and purifying the soil. Rivers sprung up where her tears fell, and the land was blessed. But as she cried, she put so much of her power and spirit into her tears that she began to fade away. She diminished, and was gone. For a year, the people prayed, singing her name every day, calling to her, begging her to return. The harvests that year were bountiful, the lambs and calves and foals healthy and numerous. As the winter rains fell gently on the land, the people prayed and chanted her name. In the spring, as new life began to grow from the fertile soil, [Jeevali](<../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/jeevali.md>) also grew from the ground, the power of the belief of her people restoring her.

At the climax of the story, the shrine is set alight, marking the death of Jeevali and the end of the religious cycle of the year. Many people stay awake through the night, in prayer or reflection. 

The next morning, a great procession marks the festival, with costumes and flair and joyous dancing. People gather their contributions to the new shrine, and by some trick of the light or by the magic of the gods these all these individual offerings begin to fuse together. A great feast then follows.

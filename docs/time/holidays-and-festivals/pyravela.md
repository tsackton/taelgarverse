# Pyravela
*(pie-ra-vel-a)*

An ancient [Mos Numena](<../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) holiday, celebrated on the last three days of the year in the Drankorian reckoning, December 29-31. 

- Pyravela is an ancient holiday, originally developed in the early days of [Mos Numena](<../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>), during the formative religious period on Hkar.
- In [Drankor](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>), marked the end of the 10-day intercalary period between the end of the year (marked by the winter solstice) and the beginning of the new year. In modern calendars, these intercalary days are gone, so is celebrated on the last few days of the year.
- Associated with the Wyrdling, who was seen to have power over the “days out of time” in [Drankor](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>).
- Strongest universal traditions are associated with costumed parades / fetes / dances, and feasts, typically large parties where anyone is welcome to come and eat from your table. During Pyravela the rich and the poor sit together and no one is turned away because of status or wealth. 
- Another universal tradition is bonfires the last night, and especially the idea of casting prayers into the fire, especially prayers for change, for hope for new beginnings, for dreams to come true. Often incense and sometimes drugs are burned in these fires, and those who breath the smoke are said to receive visions and prophecies from the Wyrdling. The last night, with the bonfires, are a time when the future is close and prophecy fills the air. 

The typical Pyravela celebration in [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>) area is as follows:

- The first day of the festival starts with a prayer service in the Wyrdling’s temple, followed by a parade in which guilds sponsor reenactments of important miracles of the Wyrdling, especially involving prophecy, dreams, and blessings of luck
- The first day ends with feasts: these are great public feasts open to all, and often where the rich and powerful serve their guests. Costumes, masks, and elaborate clothes are common for rich and poor alike. 
- Feasts continue throughout the second day. Games of chance are common, and usually on this day guilds, merchants, and the rich and powerful compete to throw the most raucous parties - this is seen as critical to ensuring the Wyrdling’s blessing of luck on the following year. 
- The third day usually starts with private feasts at home, often involving gift giving among family and private remembrances of miracles and blessings.
- As the sun sets on the third day, the bonfires are lit. Traditionally no food is eaten after sunset, until the new year dawns, and this is a time when prophecy and dreams are at their strongest.

In [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), state sponsored feasts and games dominant the celebration of Pyravela, and the first day especially has a very state-oriented feeling.

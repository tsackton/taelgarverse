# The Festival of the Bridge

A [Mos Numena](<../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena/mos-numena.md>) feast day, celebrated on November 3rd each winter in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) and the surrounding towns. It commemorates an ancient miracle when a single patrol of guards, led by a blessed priest of the Warlord, Robert Sonneboar, held the bridge for three days against a [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) horde without reinforcements.

Today it is commemorated by eating "river bread", a type of fried dough made to look a bit like the great bridge. Various organizations and people in town make their own variants (sweet or savoury) and there is something of an atmosphere of a bake-off. The organization with the most popular river bread is crowned champion of the bridge and gains bragging rights for the next year.

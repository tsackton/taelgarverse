# Festival of the Miracle of the Mist

A [Mos Numena](<../../cosmology/religions/mos-numena.md>) feast day, celebrated on April 18th each spring in Abenfyrd and several other communites in the headwaters of the Aben. It commemorates of a time when [The Wanderer](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/mos-numena/the-wanderer.md>) (it is said) used dense mists to lead a pack of trolls from the Plaguelands into the river, to drown.
